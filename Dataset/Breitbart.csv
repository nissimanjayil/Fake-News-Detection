76 Franciscan Nuns From Same German Monastery Test Corona Positive,['Breitbart London'],"BERLIN (AP) – Seventy-six Catholic nuns have tested positive for COVID-19 after an outbreak at a Franciscan convent in northwestern Germany, church authorities said Tuesday.

Another 85 nuns received negative test results at the monastery in Thuine, not far from the Dutch border, the convent’s Mother Superior told The Associated Press.

“We are grateful that so far nobody is in the hospital,” Sister Maria Cordis Reiker said.

Local health authorities put the the entire monastery under quarantine late last week after the first cases of coronavirus were discovered there. Most Catholic nuns in Germany are elderly women because convents have had difficulties for decades recruiting young women for their cause.

Reiker said they were still waiting for the test results of the 160 non-clerical employees of the monastery, including nurses working at the monastery’s old people’s home, and others working at the monastery’s kitchen and wash house.

The nuns also run a boys´ boarding school and several other schools including a vocational school.

“We don’t know how things will continue regarding our schools, it’s all still in flux,” she said.

She said local health and school officials were in touch with the schools.

Overall in Germany, 13,604 more people tested positive over the last 24 hours and 388 others died of COVID-19, the country’s national disease control center, the Robert Koch Institute, reported.

While the number of new virus cases among younger people is decreasing in Germany, it´s going up among older people, the institute said.",BreitBart,-1
Boris Faces Massive Tory Rebellion over Coronavirus Restrictions,['Victoria Friedman'],"Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion of up to 100 Conservative MPs planning to vote against putting 99 per cent of England under the top two strictest coronavirus measures.

The prime minister’s proposals from last week revealed that despite England being under a month-long lockdown during November, more of the country will find itself in a higher tier coming out of shutdown than going in, with just Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in Tier 1.

Conservative MPs were outraged by the recommended demarcations, calling the measures “authoritarian”, with others saying that the “wheels are coming off the government’s arguments” to continue imposing them.

14.6 million more people in England are now in Tier 3 compared to pre-lockdown, when cases were also falling. Meanwhile, non-Covid deaths at home are rising way above the 5 year average as many are too scared or unable to get to hospital. Lockdowns don’t work. pic.twitter.com/wtNDkMJjli — The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 29, 2020

MPs are set to vote on the measures in the House of Commons today, with media reporting that as many as between 50 and 100 Tories will rebel against their own government and vote against them, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.

The Guardian has also reported that Labour plans to abstain from voting, because the financial support, derived from taxpayers, for the hospitality industry must go further than the government’s recovery package.

Tier 2 bans socialising indoors with anyone outside their house or support bubble and limits it to six outdoors, while Tier 3 prohibits any mixing with people not in your household or bubble inside or in most outdoor settings. Tier 3 also sees pubs, bars, and restaurants close unless they can function as takeaways, while in Tier 2, alcohol at hospitality venues can only be served with a ‘substantial meal’.

Conservative lockdown sceptics from the COVID Recovery Group won a minor battle in forcing the Johnson administration to release the impact assessments that informed the government’s decision, but MPs are said to be disappointed with the document, described as “thin” and containing a “rehashed” and frustrating analysis.

Chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, Mark Harper, said: “Even with so little time, the government’s analysis seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny.

“Before the current lockdown, incorrect death and hospital capacity modelling was leaked into the public domain to justify it. We asked for full details. We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections, and they have not been forthcoming.

“We are now seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the government’s arguments.”

Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith called the document a “cut and paste job”, insinuating that the government had provided no new analysis at all.

However, despite the anticipated massive Tory rebellion and Labour abstaining, the proposals are expected to pass with support from the Conservative “payroll vote” government ministers and Johnson loyalists in the backbench, as well as a handful of Labour MPs defying Sir Keir Starmer.",BreitBart,-1
Tucker Carlson: ‘Dr. Fauci Was Revealed as a Power-Mad Incompetent’,['Jeff Poor'],"Monday, Fox News Channel’s Tucker Carlson opened his program questioning the decisions of National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, including closing down schools to children, a segment of the population that does not appear to be as vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19.

Carlson insisted Fauci could have intervened earlier and prevented Draconian measures from being taken with regards to coronavirus and education.

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: I hope you had a great and relaxing Thanksgiving weekend, away from the endless drone of news. If you somehow managed to pull that off, a few days of peace and happiness with the ones you love, you found it was like a spa treatment. You’re obviously better off for it.

But you also may be wondering what happened? What did you miss over the weekend? And we’re here to tell you.

For starters, Joe Biden broke his foot in a couple of places. It sounds serious, but don’t worry about it. Biden was just out playing with his dog as healthy, vibrant adults in full command of their faculties are not at all fragile and fading often do. It could have happened to anyone. Seriously, it’s totally normal.

CNN, in fact, wrote a piece congratulating Biden for it. Biden’s injuries are far better than Donald Trump’s. So don’t ask questions. You’ve got bigger stories to worry about in the news landscape.

For example, did you hear that Joe Biden picked women to lead the White House Communications Office? That was a historic moment. Nothing like that has happened in this country since the presidency of Donald Trump. Another triumph for the forces of identity. Systemic sexism finally in retreat. Nothing can stop Joe Biden from smashing the glass ceiling, not even his dog.

So that’s what you missed.

Oh, and one other thing. The country’s public health establishment has tortured your children for eight months for no apparent reason. That happened. That story has not received a lot of coverage, but it has been confirmed tonight. The authorities have admitted 60 million American children languishing in their rooms since spring, sitting in front of screens, learning nothing, isolated from human contact, in many cases driven to mental illness.

We can now report there was no reason for any of that. The experts were wrong. They had no idea what they were doing. But the most amazing part — and this really is the headline of the story — is that they knew they were wrong when they did it. But they kept lying about it, even as American children began to kill themselves.

On Sunday in New York, city officials all but admitted this. They announced the reopening of elementary schools. Those are the same schools that they closed fewer than two weeks ago. Now, from a medical standpoint, nothing has changed. New York didn’t get an early shipment of the Pfizer vaccine. There wasn’t some groundbreaking new research paper that revolutionized our understanding of the coronavirus, nothing like that at all.

In fact, parents simply had enough and they forced Bill de Blasio to admit the obvious. This virus is not a threat to children. As de Blasio put it in that weird euphemistic way that dumb people speak, quote, “We know that the health realities for the youngest kids are the most favorable.” Well, yes, we do know that. We’ve known it for a long time. We knew it when Bill de Blasio shut down New York schools.

And Tony Fauci knew it, too, though he didn’t say anything about it. Now, he has decided to say something about it eight months late. Here’s Anthony Fauci on Sunday. And as you watch this, keep in mind that this man on the screen is leading our response, America’s response to the coronavirus.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Close the bars and keep the schools open is what we really say. Obviously, you don’t have one size fits all. But as I’ve said in the past, and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school or to get them back to school.

If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all. Not like one would have suspected.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Oh, I’ve always said you should keep the schools open says the man in charge of America’s coronavirus response to a nation whose schools have been closed for months. Right. Yes, I always said that. Check the tape. Because, quote, “If you look at the data,” says Anthony Fauci.

But wait a second. Why is this just now occurring to Tony Fauci? Isn’t this Fauci’s entire job to quote, “look at the data”? Yes, it is. And yet somehow he never thought to do that. That’s our corona czar.

Over the summer when the data look the same as they do tonight, Fauci explained that he couldn’t really say, if kids should be allowed to go to school, it was quote, “complicated.” Except it wasn’t complicated. It wasn’t complicated then, it’s not complicated now.

In April, many months ago, a study by the “Journal of the American Medical Association” found that school-aged children who get the coronavirus, quote, “Develop only mild symptoms and typically recover within two weeks.” Months later, same story, in June, a study in “The Lancet” affirmed this, quote, “COVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including in infants.” Other studies found the exact same thing. No studies found anything but that. There was never much question about it.

But if you’re looking for more evidence, check the death rates. Those are publicly available. Deaths are not hard to track. Consider the State of New Jersey. That’s one of the states hit hardest by the coronavirus. So far in New Jersey, not a single school-aged child has died from the coronavirus, not one. Many children have died from car accidents and fires and drug ODs and suicide. None have died from COVID-19.

In California, the biggest state in the United States, 40 million people live there, a total of two people under the age of 18 have died from the coronavirus — two. The numbers nationwide according to the latest C.D.C. numbers, 123 Americans under the age of 18 have died from the coronavirus, 123 out of 350 million.

We shut the schools anyway, crushing millions of kids, affecting their futures in ways we can’t even understand at this point. But it’s clear it’s bad. Really bad in some cases.

So the question is, why did we do this? And the answer is to save the teachers. The teachers unions pushed this and their servants in the Democratic Party obey. They’re the single largest donors to the Democratic Party, so of course they did.

So unionized teachers get to stay home collecting checks, while you’re losing your jobs because classrooms are just too dangerous. It’s like the Battle of the Bulge five days a week. And that’s exactly what they’ve done.

But what does the data say about this? Well, for teachers under the age of 50, and that’s the vast majority of them, the odds of surviving a coronavirus infection are roughly 99.98 percent. But we should tell you that for teachers under 70, the risk of dying escalates to a terrifying 99.5 percent chance of survival. And by the way, teachers do get sick, it likely won’t be from teaching. Children appear not to spread the coronavirus, surely not effectively. We’ve done this for a long time.

Back in May, researchers in Europe found, quote, “Children do not appear to be drivers of transmission. And we argue that reopening schools should be considered safe accompanied by certain measures.” Again, none of this is new. Tony Fauci, that data guy knew it at the time. And so did anyone in the news media who could read which is still most of them, and yet they kept lying about it, all of them.

In July, here is just one example, a panel of physicians and experts on infectious disease went on television to explain that going to school isn’t dangerous for anyone, they would send their own kids. Watch the news anchors’ reaction.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you let your kids go back to school?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will. My kids are looking forward to it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Period. Absolutely.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. As much as I can.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without hesitation?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Without hesitation. Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no concerns about sending my child to school in the fall.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would let my kids go back to school.

JOHN TORRES, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Dr. John Torres, NBC News.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They all said yes.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: “They all said yes,” says the newsreader, feigning shock. Can you believe that? Doctors have concluded their own children should go to school. They must be crazy. They are crazy. What do doctors know about coronavirus?

What was this about? And of course, you know the answer. It was about Donald Trump.

Donald Trump in this case agreed with the doctors. Therefore, the doctors had to be mocked and ignored. Here’s what the President said about schools in July.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to open our schools. Open our schools. Stop this nonsense. We open our schools.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: “Stop this nonsense. We reopen our schools.” Now in point of fact, as a scientific matter that turned out to be sound policy based on sound data. But the media told us the exact opposite of that. One headline at CNN warned of, quote, “The very clear dangers of Donald Trump’s push to reopen schools.” Google didn’t censor that as misinformation, it should have.

Another headline called out, quote, “Donald Trump’s mind-bending logic on school reopenings.” Mind-bending logic. Those damn data again, Joe Biden’s campaign didn’t want to hear it. They didn’t want you to hear it either. School was dangerous. Period.

Donald Trump claimed the opposite. Therefore, it was too dangerous to send your kids or for you to decide to send them. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ignoring how the virus spreads, risking teachers and parents’ lives, going against the advice of experts.

TRUMP: It’s had very little impact on young people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you trust him to do what’s best for our children? Because this is not a test.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Yes, going against the advice of experts. In this country, that’s no longer allowed, even and maybe especially when the experts are completely wrong. What’s the message? The message couldn’t be clearer. They’re not your kids anymore. If they were your kids, you could make the key decisions about their lives, but they’re not.

Those kids, your former kids belong to Tony Fauci now. Tony Fauci, America’s parent. He’ll make the decisions about your kids, thank you very much, in conjunction with the nation’s uber mom, who by the way, is also 80 years old, Mrs. Nancy D. Pelosi.

Watch Mrs. Pelosi fret about the health of our children.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Are you confident that students and teachers will go back safely to school in the fall?

REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): No, I think what we heard from the Secretary was malfeasance and dereliction of duty. This is appalling. They’re messing. They’re messing — the President and his administration are messing with the health of our children.

Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: If that’s not criminal, what she just said, we may need to redefine what it means to commit a crime. Sixty million school-aged children affected by a decision that was wrong and many of them hurt for life, but we just blow right past it and allow political leaders like that to blow right past with phrases like the health of our children.

What happens when you lock children in their rooms in front of screens and prevent them from experiencing human contact? Has Nancy Pelosi ever been asked that question? Has she ever wondered about the answer?

According to the Centers for Disease Control, a total of 522 children between the ages of five and 14 died of suicide in 2017. And that same age group, only 42 children have died from the coronavirus so far this year. What are those suicide numbers going to look like if we continue to take Nancy Pelosi’s advice about the health of our children? We’re going to have some indications of that. Future years will reveal the whole picture and you can be certain it’ll be horrifying.

But for right now, with incomplete data, here’s what we know. In St. Paul, Minnesota, for example, 40 percent of all grades given this year have been Fs, and you can be certain they are grading lightly, but it’s still double the normal amount of failures.

In Fairfax County, Virginia, the number of middle and high school students with failing grades in two or more classes has increased by 83 percent. The number of students with disabilities who are failing two or more classes has increased by more than 100 percent.

In a lot of school districts, huge numbers of kids never even registered for online classes. Do you have kids? Do you know anyone who does? They are learning nothing. Those are real consequences.

If you want to know the health of a society, look at its young people. Look at its schools. These are obvious points that are being roundly ignored and anyone who makes them is attacked for making them. We’re going to look back on this woman in shame.

Back in June, we interviewed Dr. Scott Atlas. He was then a member of the White House’s Coronavirus Taskforce. He was one of the very few people then or now brave enough to make a simple point. Here’s what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. SCOTT ATLAS, FORMER MEMBER OF WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE: But the point about the schools is really critical because this is the most irrational public policy probably in modern history. Children have virtually zero-risk of getting a serious complication, virtually zero risk of dying. You don’t lock down the children because you are personally afraid. It is totally outrageous.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Dr. Scott Atlas was attacked as a monster for saying that. Really attacked. Dr. Tony Fauci, by contrast, was deified. Signs throughout Northwest DC said I believe, Dr. Fauci, but the truth is that Scott Atlas was right and Dr. Fauci was revealed as a power-mad incompetent.

That’s not our opinion, by the way, the data prove it.",BreitBart,-1
David Mamet Calls Out ‘Experts’ and Questions Lockdowns: ‘The Virus Here Is Government’,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called “experts” and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

“The virus here is government—or at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,” Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence—and they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ — WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

“We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.”

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. “One is ‘permitted’ to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?”

David Mamet compares today’s coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. “Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,” he added. “The news media, backed by those parts of the ‘scientific community’ the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.”

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

“A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.”

Coronavirus Robs Biblical Bethlehem of Christmas Cheer,['Breitbart News'],"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) — The coronavirus has cast a pall over Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem, all but shutting down the biblical town revered as Jesus’ birthplace at the height of the normally cheery holiday season.

Missing are the thousands of international pilgrims who normally descend upon the town. Restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops are closed. The renowned Christmas tree lighting service will be limited to a small group of authorized people, as will church services on Christmas Eve.

“Bethlehem is dead,” said Maryana al-Arja, owner of the 120-room Angel Hotel on the outskirts of Bethlehem.

The hotel was the site of the West Bank’s first coronavirus outbreak — when a group of Greek tourists came down with the virus last March.

She kept her 25 workers on staff for several months but ultimately couldn’t continue to pay them. Al-Arja, who herself was infected with the virus, said she has been forced to close the hotel and lay off the entire staff because there is no sign of the pandemic ending or tourists visiting anytime soon.

“We had 351 tourist groups booked in our hotel this year, each one 150 people,” she said. “But they all canceled.”

Elyas al-Arja, the head of the city’s hotel association, said Bethlehem received some 3 million tourists in 2019. With Israel, the main entry point for international visitors to the region, banning tourists because of the coronavirus crisis, and the West Bank’s border crossing with Jordan closed to foreigners, that number is close to zero this year, he said.

“Sixty percent of the city relies on tourism, and their income disappeared when the tourists disappeared,” said al-Arja, a cousin of the Angel Hotel owner.

The Ambassador Hotel, which is located near the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, has reopened one floor in hopes that some local visitors may want to come celebrate in the coming weeks.

Mahmoud Tarman, the hotel’s receptionist, said the Ambassador has brought back eight of its 60 workers to serve local guests. But with the West Bank’s economy devastated by repeated lockdowns, it remains unclear how many people will come.

“At this time of the year, this empty hotel would be bustling with life. But as you see, there is no life, not even a Christmas tree yet,” he said as he pointed at the empty lobby.

The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, this week imposed a new nighttime lockdown to help contain a spike in coronavirus cases. People must remain indoors from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m., and Bethlehem is included in the lockdown.

Officials say the lockdown could be extended through Christmas and into the new year if the infection levels don’t come down. The Health Ministry has reported a total of about 65,000 coronavirus cases in the West Bank, and over 620 deaths.

Bethlehem’s mayor, Anton Salman, said the city had planned to receive 3,000 invited guests, including local scout troops and musical bands from around the world that normally entertain visitors during Christmas Eve festivities.

He said the famed Christmas tree lighting, scheduled on Thursday, will be limited to just 15 guests, including local mayors, the district governor and the Latin Patriarch and other clergy. The 85-year-old Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who usually joins the celebration, has been invited but has not said whether he will attend.

Midnight Mass, a solemn event led by the Latin Patriarch that is usually attended by religious leaders, local VIPs and hundreds of pilgrims from around the world, has also been scaled back, Salman said. He said officials are still working on the guest list, but it is expected to include religious leaders and some foreign diplomats. The event will be closed to the general public but broadcast live for people to watch.

“No one can hold the responsibility of inviting large numbers of people to Christmas events,” he said. “Nothing will be the same during the pandemic.”",BreitBart,-1
SF Archbishop Says New Church Closures Violate Religious Freedom,['Thomas D. Williams'],"San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said this weekend a new ban on worship violates a “a natural and a Constitutional right.”

Archbishop Cordileone objected to the state’s lumping together of religious worship with “non-essential indoor activities such as gyms, movie theaters, and museums” while arbitrarily allowing “for indoor retail at 25 percent capacity and permits massage parlors, hair and nail salons, and tattoo parlors to operate indoors.”

In his statement, the archbishop criticized a new health order from the state of California that places San Francisco and San Mateo Counties into a more restrictive “purple” tier of coronavirus restrictions, which unfairly denigrates the right to religious worship.

“This is precisely the kind of blatant discrimination to which the Supreme Court gave injunctive relief in New York,” Cordileone said, in reference to last Wednesday’s SCOTUS ruling barring the state from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship.

Even in a pandemic, “the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 5-4 decision. “The restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty.”

England’s faith leaders have united in calling on the UK government to permit public worship during the forthcoming lockdown in England, insisting that such worship is “essential.” https://t.co/FohO0VnRAE — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 3, 2020

The San Francisco archbishop insisted in his statement that for Catholic Christians, worship of God and the reception of the sacraments are “essential” activities.

“The government is demoting worship to the same status as watching a movie: ‘non-essential,’” Cordileone said. “But worship is both a natural and a Constitutional right. My people want to receive the Body and Blood of Christ; they need it, and have every right to be free to do so.”

Cordileone also insisted that his archdiocese has adhered scrupulously to measures mandated to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

“Catholics in San Francisco are absolutely committed to public safety in conducting worship services,” he said. “Our protocols require masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation.”

“But the government still chooses to treat worship as less important than shopping for shoes,” he added.

While declaring that he is “deeply sympathetic to public health concerns about a surge in COVID hospitalizations,” the archbishop also noted that “we know of no cases of transmission of the virus as a result of in-person worship inside of our churches.”

Defiant French Priests Break Lockdown Rules to Keep Churches Open,['Chris Tomlinson'],"Lille priests are rejecting the French government’s Wuhan coronavirus restrictions by allowing more than 30 parishioners in their churches at one time.

The archbishop of Lille, Laurent Ulrich, spoke out against the government’s restrictions, calling them “arbitrary, discriminatory and unrealistic”, and told the priests under him to “welcome all believers” into their churches.

On Sunday, shortly before mass at the Notre-Dame de la Treille Cathedral, Father Bruno Mary commented on the situation, saying: “We are not outlaws, we are just trying to be intelligent.”

“Monsignor Ulrich told us to do what we could with respect for sanitary measures,” he added, according to 20 minutes.

French Catholics Gather to Protest Church Closures Under Lockdown https://t.co/fOM699igck — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 16, 2020

Father Mary said that he and his colleagues took in multiple groups of 30 people into the church, which typically holds around 1,200 people. “We organise ourselves as best we can, taking into account vulnerable people,” he said.

“We understand that the government is focused on the economy. People have to live. But churches are places of comfort that people need right now,” Father Mary said.

Over the weekend, the French Council of State, France’s highest administrative court, ordered the government to reexamine the restrictions on churches within three days, after arguing that they were “disproportionate”.

“If some establishments remain open to the public, [such as cinemas or theatres,] while places of worship remained closed, the activities carried out there are not of the same nature, and the fundamental freedoms that are at stake are not the same,” the Council of State said, rationalising that the freedom to worship has a different status and requires special protection under the law.

The Council of State’s order comes after several protests in early November by Christians outside of churches across the country after the government of President Emmanuel Macron introduced the 30-parishioner limit.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in various cities, including as many as 600 in Versailles and 400 in Nantes over a single weekend.

“We follow protocols, there has not been an outbreak of contamination in churches to my knowledge. We want to assert our right to Mass. This is a matter of freedom of religion,” one protester said.",BreitBart,-1

Los Angeles County has shut down outdoor dining for three weeks, effective Nov. 25. The county, and the state, are experiencing a coronavirus spike.

Fellow supervisor Janice Hahn, who voted against the outdoor dining ban, told KTTV’s Elex Michaelson that the danger of public officials doing what they have told constituents not to do means that they are “beginning to lose the trust of the public.”

She said there was not sufficient scientific evidence to support the ban on outdoor dining, given the economic cost before the holidays.

"Kentucky AG: Closing Religious Schools Violates First Amendment, ‘We’re Ready’ to Send Lawsuit to SCOTUS",['Ian Hanchett'],"On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) stated that he will send his lawsuit arguing that Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s (D) school closures violate the First Amendment because they have closed down religious schools to the Supreme Court.

Cameron said that the governor has “repeatedly” infringed on “the First Amendment free exercise of religion here in the commonwealth of Kentucky. Again, I respect his responsibility to keep people safe. But we have to safeguard our religious freedoms here in Kentucky. And so, when you tell folks who send their kids to religious-affiliated schools, which is an act of worship within itself, that they cannot go to school, it infringes upon the First Amendment rights.”

He added, “We won at the federal district court, who said that there was — it was appropriate to issue a statewide injunction because he’d infringed upon First Amendment rights. A panel at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and stayed that injunction. And so, now we’re ready to send our case to the Supreme Court. We’ll be applying for review by the Supreme Court, hopefully, today.”

FNC’s Geraldo Rivera: Trump Must Stop Attacking Election Results — ‘Enough Is Enough Now’,['Pam Key'],"Fox News Channel’s Geraldo Rivera called on President Donald Trump to stop attacking the presidential election as fraudulent because it could cost the Republican Party the Georgia Senate races and control of the Senate during an appearance on Monday’s broadcast of “The Story.”

Rivera said, “If people lose faith in Georgia’s electoral system and not show up, then they will be gifting Democrats control of the United States Senate. The stakes are so very high. They are astronomical. You know, as a person who has been accused of giving the president too much of the benefit of the doubt, I can’t imagine why the Republican senators aren’t rallying around the Georgia Republicans – the secretary of state and the governor there – and saying that, ‘The system in Georgia will work. You got to vote. Everything is at stake here.’ Rather than attacking the system, not only in Georgia but nationwide, undermines faith in the system, discourages people.”

He continued, “I think that the president is on the wrong course here. I think he has got to take a real gut check between now and Saturday. With all due respect, and you know I love the guy, but enough is enough now.”

He added, “This is the job he has now as the head of the GOP, as the commander-in-chief of the country – he’s gotta rally the voters in Georgia. Control of the Senate is in the balance now, and if he allows his personal, you know, annoyance with the secretary of state and Governor Kemp to rule, then I think it’s going to be a devastating loss for the Republican Party.”

Donald Trump Coronavirus Adviser Scott Atlas Resigns,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump’s special adviser for the coronavirus pandemic, Scott Atlas, resigned in a letter published on Monday.

Atlas joined the White House in August as a Special Government Employee, which has a 130-day detail limit that will expire this week.

“I thank you for the honor and privilege to serve on behalf of the American people since August, during these difficult months for our nation,” Atlas wrote in the resignation letter that he posted on Twitter.

The news was first reported by Fox News reporter Brooke Singman.

Atlas offered the president a different perspective than many of the bureaucratic federal scientists and officials who put the country in a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.

“[P]erhaps More than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor,” Atlas wrote.

Atlas said he was honored to serve in the White House and celebrated the success of Operation Warp Speed developing a vaccine in record time.

“Throughout my time at the White House, it was an honor to work with several selfless colleagues in designing specific policies to heighten protection of the vulnerable while safely reopening schools and society,” he wrote.

Atlas was treated poorly by the corporate media, especially when his advice conflicted with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Centers for Disease Control Dr. Robert Redfield, who bristled at some his recommendations.

Facui said he had “real problems” with some of Atlas’s recommendations, and Redfield panned Atlas in a phone conversation that “everything he says is false.”

Atlas alluded to the struggle in his resignation letter, reasserting the importance of scientific debate.

“Although some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of any civilized society,” he wrote. “Indeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent.”

"Slaoui: All At-Risk Individuals Should Get COVID Vaccine in Two, Two-and-a-Half Months",['Ian Hanchett'],"On Monday’s broadcast of CNN’s “OutFront,” Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser Dr. Moncef Slaoui said that he believes every at-risk person who needs a coronavirus vaccine “on a priority level” will be able to get a vaccine over a period of two or two-and-a-half months after the vaccine is approved.

Slaoui said, “What’s important to note is, the number of doses, the amount of vaccine that we have is still limited in comparison to the needs. We need — there [are] about 120 million at risk in the U.S. We will have, by the end of the month of December, about 40 million doses of vaccine. So, it’s going to take a while for all Americans who need it on a priority level to get it. But, you know, over probably two or two-and-a-half months they will all get it.”

Articles of Impeachment Filed Against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A total of 12 articles of impeachment have officially been filed against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine over abuse of power during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Ohio State Rep. John Becker (R) was joined by Representatives Candice Keller (R), Nino Vitale (R), and Paul Zeltwanger (R) in filing articles of impeachment against Governor DeWine, according to a report by Cleveland 19 News.

The representatives argue that DeWine has abused his power during the pandemic, noting that the governor vetoed Senate Bill 55 — and threatened to veto other General Assembly legislation, including Senate Bill 311 — which seeks to severely limit the governor’s power during a pandemic.

“Governor DeWine’s mismanagement, malfeasance, misfeasance, abuse of power, and other crimes include, but are not limited to, meddling in the conduct of a presidential primary election, arbitrarily closing and placing curfews on certain businesses, while allowing other businesses to remain open,” said Rep. Becker’s office in a statement.

“He weaponized the Ohio Bureau of Workers’ Compensation to bully and harass businesses and the people; to enforce a statewide mask mandate and other controversial measures of dubious ‘value,’ making Ohio a hostile work environment,” the statement added.

The statement goes on to cite the governor’s inclusion of places of worship during shutdown orders, as well as the implementation a statewide mask mandate, which has been in effect in one way or another since the summer.

“Rather than hearing the cries of Ohioans, Governor DeWine continues to stifle those cries by finding more inventive ways to use masks to muffle the voices of the people,” said Rep. Becker in his statement.

“He continues to have callous disregard for the fact that his isolation policies have led to a shockingly high number of suicides, alarming rates of drug abuse, persistently high unemployment, and the forced abandonment of the elderly by their loved ones,” the representative added.

Becker first announced his decision to file articles of impeachment against DeWine in August, citing the same issues.

According to Ohio’s Constitution, the State House of Representatives has the sole power of impeachment, but a majority of members are needed in order for impeachment to concur. It would then go to the State Senate, with a two-thirds vote needed to convict a governor of impeachment.

"FNC’s Makary: FDA Should Be Able to Turn Vaccine Applications Around in 24 Hours, They’re ‘Too Bureaucratic’ and Slow",['Ian Hanchett'],"On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Bill Hemmer Reports,” Fox News Medical Contributor Dr. Marty Makary stated that the FDA is “too bureaucratic, taking too much time” on the coronavirus vaccine and they should be able to turn around applications for authorization for the vaccine in 24 hours.

Makary said, “The review committee is not interviewing subjects and volunteers. They’re not looking under a microscope at the cells or the virus. They are simply reading a piece of paper with the numbers. We have an internet now, they can get those numbers in real-time. Europe does a rolling review and they turn things around quicker. Britain is slated to get the vaccine in arms before the United States, same vaccine. The FDA has been too bureaucratic, taking too much time, and I don’t know if they’re scheduling around vacation times and tee times of the reviewers, but they should turn the application around in 24 hours.”

"Gavin Newsom Threatens ‘Drastic Actions,’ Including Stay-at-Home Order",['Joel B. Pollak'],"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that “drastic actions” such as a new stay-at-home order might be necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus in the state.

Newsom said that the state had reached a “tipping point,” and that with the continued increase in hospitalizations due to the disease, the state could run out of hospital beds by Christmas.

This is the tipping point. CA has worked hard to prepare for a surge—but we can’t sustain the record high cases we’re seeing. Current projections show CA will run out of current ICU beds before Christmas Eve. Please stay safe & stay home as much as you can for next few weeks. pic.twitter.com/5NJYzHokhE — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 30, 2020

The Los Angeles Times reported:

Of particular concern is the state’s intensive care capacity. Currently, about 75% of the state’s 7,733 ICU beds are occupied — with 1,812 of them filled by coronavirus patients. Unless things change, the state could exhaust its existing ICU capacity by mid-December, according to projections Newsom presented. “If these trends continue, we’re going to have to take much more dramatic — arguably drastic — actions,” he said during a briefing. Those include “the potential for a stay-at-home order” for areas in the strictest purple tier of California’s coronavirus reopening road map, he said. Of the state’s 58 counties, 51 are in the purple tier.

The state’s “purple tier” counties are already under a month-long, 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.

State and local officials are particularly worried about coronavirus spikes over the holidays. In Los Angeles County, officials have prohibited outdoor dining at restaurants and imposed new restrictions on business capacity.

In more positive news, Newsom tweeted that California will receive 327,000 doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by mid-December.

Ravens-Steelers Rescheduled Again by COVID-19 to Wednesday,[],"The Baltimore Ravens’ struggle to contain an extended outbreak of the coronavirus forced their rescheduled game Tuesday night against the unbeaten Pittsburgh Steelers to be moved back to Wednesday.

It’s the third fix to a matchup originally slated to be played Thanksgiving night.

The NFL announced the most recent switch Monday after the Ravens placed starters Matthew Judon, Willie Snead and Mark Andrews on the reserve/COVID-19 list.

Although Baltimore also had four players return from that list, the team will still be severely short-handed when this game is finally played.

The addition of Judon, a standout linebacker, and Andrews, the leading receiver on the team, brings to seven the number of 2019 Pro Bowl players that Baltimore has placed on the COVID-19 list over the past week.

Cornerback Terrell Bonds, who’s on injured reserve, was also added to the expansive list Monday.

There was a bit of good news, however: Baltimore activated linebacker Jayson Ferguson, offensive lineman D.J. Fluker and defensive tackle Broderick Washington from the COVID-19 list. Defensive back Iman Marshall was also activated, although he’s been on IR since tearing his right ACL in August.

The contest pitting two longtime rivals was originally scheduled for Thanksgiving night before a rash of coronavirus cases among the Ravens forced the game to be postponed to Sunday. As Baltimore continued to stack up positive tests, the game was moved back to Tuesday night.

Now, perhaps, they’ll finally meet on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. Or not.

The Ravens (6-4) will face the Steelers without several of their top playmakers, including quarterback Lamar Jackson, running backs Mark Ingram and J.K. Dobbins, and defensive linemen Calais Campbell and Brandon Williams.

The loss of Andrews and Snead will further hinder backup quarterback Robert Griffin III, who will be taking snaps from a third-string center after Patrick Mekari and Matt Skura were placed on the COVID-19 list on Wednesday.

Andrews is a Type-1 diabetic, which makes COVID-19 potentially more dangerous. His loss should have an impact in that he leads Baltimore in receptions (38), yards receiving (454) and touchdown catches (6).

Andrews, Judon, Jackson, Ingram, Campbell, fullback Patrick Ricard and long snapper Morgan Cox were all selected to the Pro Bowl last season. Jackson, of course, was the NFL’s MVP in 2019.

Judon owns Baltimore’s franchise tag. He is tied for the team lead with four sacks and has 34 tackles.

Snead has 17 catches for 230 yards and two touchdowns over the past four games.

The NFL’s last Wednesday game was the 2012 season opener between the Giants and the Cowboys, which was moved from a Thursday night because of a conflict with the Democratic National Convention, which was scheduled to have President Barack Obama speak on Thursday night.

“We understand that every team is going through something like this,” Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward said. “Not to this extent, but we have to be ready for any situation. I think (coach Mike Tomlin) has laid out the plan. It’s up for us to follow it and it’s up for us to bounce back with it.”

Added Steelers tackle Zach Banner, who was injured in the season opener: “I’m gonna be healthy by the time we play this game.”

Still to be decided is when the scheduled Week 13 game between the Steelers and Washington will be played. It is currently set for Sunday at Heinz Field. Baltimore is supposed to host Dallas on Dec. 7.",BreitBart,-1
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Says School Must Remain Open,['Joshua Caplan'],"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Monday said that schools are required to remain open for in-person learning in the spring as the state continues to battle the coronavirus.

WEAR-TV reports:

[The schools] will also continue to offer virtual options, although there will be stricter monitoring requirements in virtual classes. When it comes to virtual classes, the new rules will require parents to be notified if the student is struggling with virtual learning. Transitions to in-person learning may then be made, unless a parent objects.

“Closing schools due to coronavirus is probably the biggest blunder in modern American history,” DeSantis told reporters.

“People who advocate closing schools for virus mitigation are effectively today’s flat-Earthers, they have no scientific or evidence support for their position,” he added.

Florida is experiencing a rise in coronavirus cases with 990,000 confirmed infections since the pandemic started.

DeSantis’s comments come after the governor extended his order barring local governments from imposing mask mandates.

“Just as an act of executive grace, all outstanding fines and penalties that have been applied against individuals are suspended,” DeSantis said last week.

“I think we need to get away from trying to penalize people for not social distancing and work with people constructively,” he added.",BreitBart,-1
49ers to Play 2 Upcoming Home Games in Arizona,[],"The San Francisco 49ers will play two home games in Arizona after new coronavirus regulations put in place by officials in Northern California forced the team to find a temporary new home.

The 49ers (5-6) will host the Buffalo Bills next Monday night and Washington on Dec. 13 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals, because they won’t be able to practice or play games in their home in Santa Clara County for three weeks.

The team said it will have information on practice arrangements later but it will likely need to look outside the area because the rules imposed by Santa Clara County will require the players to quarantine for 14 days any time they travel more than 150 miles.

Niners CEO Jed York said the team had offers from San Diego and Arizona but playing at the Cardinals’ home proved to be the best option. He thanked Cardinals owner Michael Bidwell and the officials in Arizona for their help in “these unprecedented times.”

“The Cardinals organization, State Farm Stadium and League officials have been supportive and accommodating as we work through the many logistical issues involved in relocating NFL games,” the 49ers said in a statement.

Santa Clara County announced rules Saturday that include a three-week ban on practices and games for contact sports starting Monday. The Niners were on a plane getting ready to travel to Los Angeles, where they beat the Rams 23-20 on Sunday, when the players and coaches heard about the rules.

Now they will likely head on an even longer road trip while trying to make a late-season playoff run. San Francisco is currently one game out of a playoff spot.

“The biggest thing for me is us all leaving our families,” coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. “We’re all human just like everyone else. It’s a big deal to leave your family for the whole month of December. A huge deal, as everyone knows. This virus is a huge deal.”

Shanahan said it was “extremely disappointing” the players and coaches learned about the new rules on social media as they were on the plane.

The county said the dramatic rise in cases required “quick action” and that the priority was making sure there is enough hospital space to deal with the coronavirus and any other health issues.

“The 49ers are one of the thousands of organizations impacted by our most recent actions,” the county said in a statement. “The County of Santa Clara has been in regular communication with the 49ers both before and after the announcement of the revised mandatory directive affecting all contact sports. We continue to do everything we can to support the 49ers, as well as all local businesses, affected communities, and families impacted by the pandemic.”

The Niners have road games scheduled at Dallas on Dec. 20 and then again on Dec. 26 at their temporary home in Arizona against the Cardinals.

They finish the season with a home game against Seattle on Jan. 3, which could be played at Levi’s Stadium if the ban is lifted as scheduled Dec. 21.

“We just got to have that open mind and positive attitude and make sure that first and foremost that everybody’s safe,” said running back Raheem Mostert, whose wife gave birth to the couple’s second child during the season back home in the Cleveland area. “That’s the main goal.”

The AFC East-leading Bills (8-3) return to Arizona for the second time in a little over three weeks, following a heartbreaking 32-30 loss to the Cardinals. The game was decided by DeAndre Hopkins’ leaping catch of Kyler Murray’s 43-yard touchdown pass with two seconds left.

The catch was immediately dubbed the “Hail Murray,” and came 32 seconds after Buffalo pulled ahead on Stefon Diggs’ 21-yard touchdown reception. Buffalo squandered a 23-9 lead before heading into its bye week.

The Bills are coming off a 27-17 win over the Los Angeles Chargers.

The rules also will impact the San Jose Sharks of the NHL and college teams at Stanford and San Jose State.

There is no start date yet for NHL training camp but some Sharks players have been taking part in voluntary rehabilitation and training in a socially distanced setting at the team’s facility in San Jose. The team said those will have to be modified to comply with the health order.

“We are reviewing what options may be available locally to allow these players to receive rehabilitation treatment and continue their training for the upcoming season,” the team said in a statement.",BreitBart,-1
Andrew Cuomo Tells Hospitals to Recruit Retired Doctors 'NOW',['Amy Furr'],"New York is preparing to recruit retired doctors and nurses to staff hospitals dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Monday.

The governor called it a “new phase in the war against COVID [Chinese coronavirus],” according to the New York Post, adding that daily hospitalizations across the state are almost quadruple what they were in June.

Cuomo said every hospital in New York must compile a list of retired doctors and nurses they can call on because of staffing problems in some areas.

“I am very worried about staff shortages. I’m more concerned about the staff shortage than I am the [number of hospital] beds. We can build beds. We can’t create more staff. And the staff is starting tired,” he explained.

In a tweet Monday morning, the governor shared an infographic titled Initiate Emergency Hospital Procedures, with the first point reading, “Staff shortage: identify retired nurses and doctors NOW”:

We are laser-focused on ensuring enough hospital capacity as COVID surges. Today @HealthNYGov is initiating emergency hospital measures. Hospitals are directed to identify retired staff, make plans to add 50% bed capacity, confirm they have a 90-day PPE stockpile, and more. pic.twitter.com/6XzF4jXFxY — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 30, 2020

In a subsequent post, Cuomo told residents to stop attending small gatherings immediately.

“Hospitalizations are climbing — statewide. What can you do? Cut out the small gatherings. Now. 65% of all cases are traced to small gatherings. Gov’t can’t enforce who’s in your living room. But you can,” he wrote.

As his state prepares to go into another lockdown that could put thousands out of work, Cuomo accepted his International Emmy Award last week by claiming victory and saying his press conferences offered “authentic truth and stability,” according to Breitbart News.

“In what became a Cuomo love-in for the so-called ‘Love Gov,’ a chorus of celebrities joined in to sing the governor’s praises,” the report continued:

Absent from the ceremony was any mention of Gov. Cuomo’s March directive ordering New York nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, which caused the virus to spread like wild fire among that state’s elderly and infirm population. His decision contributed to the state’s COVID-19 mortality rate, which currently ranks as the second highest in the nation.

“Cuomo’s nursing home mandate reportedly led to 6,000 nursing home deaths from the coronavirus,” the article read.",BreitBart,-1
El Paso Mayor Attributes Coronavirus Spike to Shopping at Large Retailers,['Hannah Bleau'],"El Paso Mayor Dee Margo (R) is attributing the recent spike in cases of the Chinese coronavirus to individuals shopping at large retailers during a Sunday appearance on CBS News’s Face the Nation.

On Monday, the City of El Paso, Texas, reported 461 new cases of the Wuhan virus, bringing the cumulative total to 86,172 cases:

To date, 47,397 residents have recovered from the virus and 37,267 cases remain active. For more information and other data visit https://t.co/ZQYzXomtTr — City of El Paso (@ElPasoTXGov) November 30, 2020

On Sunday, the city’s mayor attributed the spike in cases to people experiencing “COVID fatigue.”

“We hit, oh, about almost six weeks ago, we started spiking significantly. I think people just— the consensus is people just had COVID fatigue and they let down, as Dr. Birx said, you got to wear the mask and you’ve got to maintain the distancing and you’ve got to avoid the crowds,” he said, detailing the “deep dive” officials conducted into their contact tracing for the week spanning November 10 through November 16.

The investigation found that “55 percent of the positives were coming from shopping at large retailers, what we’d term as the big box stores,” according to the mayor:

And those are considered essential under CISA guidelines under homeland security. And we don’t really have- I don’t have any control over any limitations there. We’ve asked for voluntary limitations and Wal-Mart and several others are starting to meter, meaning they’re going to limit the occupancy of their- of their stores, which we think- we also dug up the fact that previously our- over 52 percent of our positives were coming in the ages of 20 to 39. Now it’s 30 to 50. So we’re just trying to maintain, but recently, and I’m- I’m fearful to even mention it, we’ve started to seem like we’re starting to maybe plateau. On Thanksgiving Day, we had 406 positives. The next day was 678.

CBS News’s Margaret Brennan asked Margo what other action he could take in light of the fact that big box retail stores, which officials say are contributing to the spread of the virus, are considered essential.

“I know you just said that you can’t shut down big box stores because they’re deemed essential,” Brennan said.

“But at a certain point, because of what you’re talking about, if people aren’t taking personal responsibility for themselves and their own behavior, do you as mayor need to shut down what businesses you can?” she asked.

The mayor explained that he “took action” to close down restaurant bars at 9 p.m., but Brennan noted that restaurants, as well as other stores, remain open.

“We were seeing a lot of congregating there. And so we shut them down at 9:00 p.m. for in-dining,” the mayor said.

“The state of Texas allowed bars to convert to restaurants with food trucks, kind of a — some of them were kind of gaming the system, we think, and there was a lot of congregation there,” he continued, switching focus to private gatherings:

But, you know, when we look at the Rio Grande Valley and Hidalgo County, which went through a spike just before ours, we talked to their health department. What they discovered in their contact tracing was the majority of their positives were coming from- from home gatherings. And that’s- that’s also still problematic here. I mean, we’re- we’re a multigenerational community and family is big– and there’s travel to Mexico. There’s also those issues.

Similarly, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has also placed an emphasis on private gatherings, reporting that 65 percent of all cases are traced to gatherings of that nature.

“This is where the spread is coming from. It’s a small gathering spread. We have to communicate this now to people the way we communicated masks,” he said during Monday’s press conference.

“Seemingly the safest place — my home my table my family. Yeah, even that place is not safe,” he added.

El Paso made headlines earlier this month over the mobilization of the Texas National Guard, which was tasked with “support[ing] the moratory affairs in the region”:

Greta Thunberg Tells Black Friday Shoppers: ‘Don’t Buy Stuff You Don’t Need’,['Amy Furr'],"Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg urged consumers to avoid buying things they do not need on Black Friday.

While many of Thunberg’s followers agreed with her, others did not.

“I hate to do this, but I NEED a PS5,” one user commented.

“I don’t take orders from clueless adolescents,” another person said.

Despite Thunberg’s warnings, consumer spending has been strong since the economy began reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, writes Breitbart News’s John Carney:

Many consumers are feeling flush, their wealth boosted by a stock market that has pushed the S&P 500 up 65 percent since the lockdown low in March and soaring home values. Money not spent on trips, sports games, movies, or eating out has apparently gone into the purchase of consumer goods and contributed to savings accounts of many households.

“Black Friday was traditionally the day when many retailers first turned a profit for the year,” Carney noted.

However, those promoting Black Friday sales appeared not to draw the same size crowds this year as in previous years.

“While the hustle and bustle of the holiday season has not completely disappeared, it is demonstratively lower this year due to fears, protocols, and limitations caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic,” Breitbart News reported.

Photos and video footage shared online showed small crowds and a few relatively empty parking lots:

We appreciate the effort, but we in #FridaysForFuture don’t wish to be linked to anything commercial.

Nor do we wish to gain from overconsumption.

Bar Files to Register as Church to Avoid Coronavirus Lockdown Rules,['Dr. Susan Berry'],"A U.K. tequila bar owner has filed an application to register his business as a church to avoid coronavirus lockdown rules.

In a Facebook post on Friday, James Aspell wrote (language warning) he is changing the name of his Nottingham bar, now called “400 Rabbits Tequila and Mezcal Cocktail Bar,” as “The Church of the 400 Rabbits.”

“With places of worship allowed to open in all tiers we thought fuck it lets start a religion!” he announced. “Can’t be that hard can it! ‘The Church of the 400 Rabbits’ launching as soon as we get the green light!”

“Congregation daily til late,” Aspell added. “More deets coming soon!”

“The intention of this is to be a joke, but it comes from a serious place, “Aspell, 34, told Nottinghamshire Live. “With the new restrictions we’re forced to close and it could be months before we can reopen. We don’t have a food offering, so even if we were in Tier 2, we couldn’t open.”

Aspell added that during the lockdown, his business has been “targeted unfairly to an extent and it seems wrong.”

“Everything from gyms to massage parlours can stay open and even the Christmas markets are happening – that was the point when I thought, this is ridiculous,” he continued. “So, we have sent in an application to register as a place of worship.”

Aspell, who has owned the bar for five years, said his application “points out the hypocrisy” of the coronavirus restrictions.

“If we were to open, we’d follow government guidelines and I don’t think we’d be selling alcohol,” he said. “We might be able to adapt in a different way and have some fun with it.”

“We’re not doing this to offend anybody or break any rules,” he added.",BreitBart,-1
Cuomo Scolds New Yorkers for Private Gatherings: 'This Is Not Government Being Overly Dramatic',['Hannah Bleau'],"Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) scolded New Yorkers for gathering with friends and families in the comfort of their private homes, identifying such gatherings as contributing to the spread of the Chinese coronavirus and defending his order limiting gatherings to no more than ten people in private homes. He also floated volunteering to assist coronavirus patients in a hospital as an alternative to private Thanksgiving gatherings, though he failed to explain how that was safer.

“This is a dramatic shift,” Cuomo said during Monday’s press conference, referencing the spike in cases caused by small gatherings:

Hospitalizations are climbing — statewide. What can you do? Cut out the small gatherings. Now. 65% of all cases are traced to small gatherings. Gov't can't enforce who's in your living room. But you can. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 30, 2020

While he acknowledged that part of it is the nature of the holiday season, he also said people are gravitating toward small gatherings due to “reduced social options.”

“I can’t go to the bar and hang out. I can’t go to a restaurant and hang out. I can’t go to the movie theater and hang out. Come over to my house, and we’ll hang out. It’s just an adaptation of social behavior to the circumstance,” Cuomo said.

“We have a rule in effect, no more than ten at an event,” Cuomo said, defending his mandate by pointing to other states that have similar rules in effect.

“People say, ‘Oh I can’t believe the New York rule, no more than ten.’ Many states have a rule of no more than ten,” he said, adding that Kentucky is instituting a rule of no more than eight.

While Cuomo has publicly asked local governments to enforce his edicts, he admitted that the government does not have the ability to monitor the number of people an individual invites into his or her dwelling.

He continued:

This is a nationwide problem. I understand the people say I don’t like the restrictions. “I have COVID fatigue. How can you say I shouldn’t have more than ten people in my house?” Look. The truth is the government doesn’t have an ability to monitor it. But you want to know what is smart, what is reasonable, what is protective of other people and yourself? This is where the spread is coming from. It’s a small gathering spread. We have to communicate this now to people the way we communicated masks. Seemingly the safest place — my home, my table, my family. Yeah, even that place is not safe.

Because of that, Cuomo’s administration will roll out a new public education campaign focusing on small, private gatherings.

“This is not government being overly dramatic. These are just facts,” Cuomo continued, arguing that his emphasis on limiting private gatherings is supported by “President Trump’s people and Joe Biden’s people.” He also cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, which advised Americans to gather with “no more than your household” for Thanksgiving.

“So whose politics are you playing if Donald Trump says the CDC mandates it and Joe Biden’s advisers say it’s smart?” he asked.

“Whose politics? Your own politics? You’re waving the political flag. Whose flag are you waving? It’s agreed to by both. It’s a fact of being smart, and luckily most of us are smart,” he continued.

The Democrat governor also used the opportunity to detail a conversation he had with a man over the weekend, who was purportedly incensed by Cuomo’s mandates, particularly his limit on gatherings in private homes.

“Nobody’s going to tell me how many people to have in my house. It’s my house. I want to have my family over I can have my family over,” Cuomo said, quoting the man.

“I said alright. I’ll make a deal with you right now. You do whatever you want in your house. Invite whoever you want. But here’s the deal. If somebody gets sick from what you did, you handle it,” Cuomo said, telling the man that he should not call an ambulance or go to the doctor and “expose” others because he “wanted to be reckless”:

I said don’t call an ambulance and expose an ambulance driver. Don’t go to the hospital and expose a nurse and a doctor … because you wanted to be reckless. You handle it. Stay at home and take care of yourself. But don’t expose people, and don’t ask people to risk their lives because you undertook risky behavior. “Oh no, no I won’t agree with that.” I said, “Oh I see. You want to be able to behave in a risky way and then if you get sick, then other people have to risk their lives because you were risky.” Is that fair? But that’s what they’re asking.

“You want to be a tough guy … go volunteer in a field hospital in Staten Island and help COVID patients if you’re a tough guy,” Cuomo said, adding, “You want to celebrate Thanksgiving? Bring your whole family and your extended family and go volunteer in a hospital and help COVID people.”

“That’s how you celebrate Thanksgiving. Don’t create more COVID-positive people and expect other people to come to your rescue. That’s not the spirit of Thanksgiving,” he added.

Cuomo did not explain how it was less risky to willingly expose an entire family to coronavirus patients in a hospital rather than gathering in a private residence with no known positive cases.",BreitBart,-1
Kim Jong-un ‘Harshly Criticizes’ North Korea’s Economic Agencies,['Ben Kew'],"“It stressed the need to put the operation and command for carrying out the Party’s economic policies on a scientific basis and display great dedication and responsibility,” reported the Korean Central News Agency (KNCA). “The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK discussed measures for important issues of carrying out immediate economic tasks for this year and adopted key decisions with unanimous approval.”

Kim’s raising of such concerns comes as the North Korean economy, which was already struggling under the weight of global economic sanctions, continues to suffer under the pressure of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Pyongyang’s own lockdowns have cut it off to much of the foreign capital it once relied on. Adding to these economic troubles has been the impact of consecutive summer typhoons believed to have devastated large swathes of the nation’s countryside.

His criticisms also follow unconfirmed reports last week that Kim has executed at least two officials in the past two months. Such reports, which cannot be independently verified, identified the two victims as a foreign exchange dealer accused of causing currency fluctuations and an official responsible for customs checks on the Chinese border.

In August, the 36-year-old dictator made a tearful admission that, despite incessant propaganda about his own unending wisdom and supernatural powers, North Korea’s economic progress has been “seriously delayed” and the population continues to struggle as a result of “unexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects.”

“Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily. I am really sorry for that,” Kim declared before a military rally.

“Although I am entrusted with the important responsibility to lead this country upholding the cause of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il thanks to the trust of all the people, my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life,” he continued.

Democrat Jon Ossoff Signals Support for Lockdowns: ‘It's Time to Trust the Experts’,['Ashley Oliver'],"Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to address coronavirus spread if public health experts indicate a need for “stronger mitigation measures,” remarking that “it’s time to trust the experts.”

Ossoff, who is challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia’s race for U.S. Senate, told CNN host Dana Bash, “The problem we’ve had all year is that politicians have been suppressing and ignoring public health advice. It’s time to trust the experts, listen to public health professionals in a public health crisis.”

Bash said the White House Coronavirus Task Force has already indicated that “this is the moment to dramatically increase mitigation” due to a resurgence of the virus. Bash asked Ossoff, “So would you support harsher restrictions in Georgia, like closing restaurants and businesses temporarily?”

The Georgia Democrat responded, “I think we should follow the expertise of public health experts like those of the CDC, which is based here in Georgia, and if that is the consensus of the public health community, we need to take that advice very seriously.”

Bash further pressed, “So if they said, ‘Shut things down temporarily,’ you’d be all for it?” to which Ossoff replied, “If the CDC and its leadership gave us strong indication that those kinds of stronger mitigation measures are necessary to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, it would be malpractice for politicians to ignore that advice.”

The Worldometer reports that Georgia currently has 162,886 active cases of the novel coronavirus, or 1.5 percent, of the state’s population of 10,617,423. At its peak, Georgia saw 6,209 new daily cases reported on November 21. Since then, new daily cases have substantially dropped, with the latest data showing 1,952 new daily cases reported on November 29.

Ossoff said the spread of the virus “is out of control” and claimed people, including incumbent Perdue, have disregarded advice of public health experts. “The problem is we’ve ignored the public health experts, so I’ll be listening to them and not to political consultants, pollsters, or folks looking out for their own financial interests, like my opponent.”

Perdue has advocated for a phased reopening of businesses and described the lockdown measures Ossoff supports as “overreaching” following Ossoff’s CNN interview:

If you think the overreaching lockdowns in states like New York and California are scary, know that Jon @Ossoff would support the very same policies – for the entire country. pic.twitter.com/RADSX01uMO — David Perdue (@Perduesenate) November 30, 2020

In the same interview, Bash also asked Ossoff about his recent endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, and whether Ossoff wants Sanders to campaign with him in the weeks leading up to the January 5 Senate runoff election. Ossoff said that while he has not had that conversation with Sanders, he welcomes Sanders’ support.

Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler expressed concern after Ossoff’s television appearance that the Georgia Democrat’s support for lockdowns aligns with the socialist ideology’s tendency for government dependency.

“On January 5th, Georgians have a clear choice between socialism and freedom,” Sigler said. “Jon Ossoff supports a national lockdown and seeks to keep the entire country shut inside until we are completely dependent on the federal government for everything. … We must reject Jon Ossoff and the radical Democrats’ socialist agenda.”

Report: Over a Quarter of Small Businesses in New York and New Jersey Closed This Year,['Hannah Bleau'],"Over a quarter of small businesses in New York and New Jersey, areas hit hardest by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, have not reopened this year, according to a report from a Harvard-run database.

The database, TrackTheRecovery.org, revealed that 27.8 percent of small businesses in New York have not reopened following the mass shutdowns that occurred in the state this year, as of November 16. Even more businesses remained closed in New Jersey — 31.2 percent.

The New York Post reported:

The figures are in line with estimates from the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, which says 28 percent of the Garden State’s small businesses had shut up shop by the end of October, according to the Star Ledger newspaper. … More than half of small businesses in both states were forced to shut their doors in the spring at the height of the pandemic, with both hitting highs in mid-April — 52.5 percent of New York businesses and 53.9 percent in the Garden States, the stats show.

The news comes as virus rates begin to spike, prompting Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D) and Phil Murphy (D) to reintroduce restrictions in their respective states.

Murphy, who was recently confronted after dining out with his maskless family after retightening restrictions in the Garden State, told Fox News Sunday that a statewide lockdown remains “on the table.”

“It has to stay on the table. Gov. Hutchinson, I think, had a similar answer to that. You hate like heck to even have to consider that, and God willing, we won’t have to,” he said, calling for a “big federal stimulus,” which he believes will act as a “lifeline” for small businesses.

“That would be a game-changer. Not just in their lives and in their prospects, but it gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of dealing with the virus. So it’s on the table in terms of a shutdown,” he continued.

“I don’t anticipate it, and I sure as heck don’t want to go that route but boy, federal stimulus would give us a lot more ammunition to do a lot more things right now,” Murphy added.

State and local governments across the country are also taking action as virus rates increase, preemptively closing businesses deemed nonessential and limiting capacity limitations at essential retailers, forming what has been dubbed “modern breadlines” in states such as New Mexico ahead of its recent two-week lockdown.",BreitBart,-1
49ers Blindsided by County Rules that Make them Homeless,[],"San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said the team was blindsided by new coronavirus regulations put in place by Santa Clara County officials that will force the 49ers to find a temporary new home for practice and games.

The county announced the new rules Saturday that include a three-week ban on practices and games for contact sports starting Monday. The Niners were on a plane getting ready to travel to Los Angeles where they beat the Rams 23-20 on Sunday when the players and coaches heard about the new rules that will force the team out of its homes.

“We’ve been working with them as a partner, just trying to figure it out,” Shanahan said. “For us to be heading out here yesterday and the relationship we have with them, for all of our players and coaches and everyone on that plane and our wives to find that out while we’re getting on a plane and no one to tell us. It was just extremely disappointing.”

A county spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Along with banning contact sports, the new rules also require anyone who has traveled more than 150 miles from the county to quarantine for 14 days. The 49ers were set to return from the trip Sunday night just hours before the rules go into effect.

The 49ers will now need to find a new place to practice and to play games. They have two home games scheduled during this three-week stretch: Dec. 7 against Buffalo and Dec. 13 against Washington.

While there are options outside Santa Clara in the Bay Area, including the Raiders’ old home at Oakland Coliseum, it appears more likely that the team will play its home games at an existing NFL stadium out of this market. The Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys have no home games scheduled on the same day as Niners home games the rest of the season.

“They made that decision and we’ve got to deal with it,” Shanahan said. “But to find that out through a tweet or a press conference where I have an entire plane coming up to me, I have all wives, everyone’s girlfriends, everyone’s family members, kids, saying that what they heard there. Are we going to be gone for the entire month of December? Are we going to be quarantined for 14 days when we get back? That’s all we could talk about for the last 18 hours because we got no answers from them. I was just very disappointed.”

The Niners have a few days to finalize their decision. With their next game not until a week from Monday, the team won’t start practicing until Thursday.

“We’ll see what the future holds,” quarterback Nick Mullens said. “It’s tough for us but it’s more tough for the families. We’ll see what happens. We’ll adjust and we’ll be ready.”

The rules also will impact the San Jose Sharks of the NHL and college teams at Stanford and San Jose State.

Stanford and San Jose State also have several sports in season. The Cardinal have one scheduled home football game left on Dec. 12 against Oregon State and will need to find a place to practice out of the county this week.

The Spartans have home football games on Dec. 5 against Hawaii and Dec. 11 against Nevada. San Jose State practiced before the season a few hundred miles away at Humboldt State because of restrictions in Santa Clara County.

San Jose State officials planned to meet with county officials on Sunday to get more details and then will formulate a plan.

“We are in a fluid situation with our football and basketball teams since their seasons are in progress,” athletic director Marie Tuite said. “We will make decisions on team practices and when and where our contests are being played in conjunction with university administration and the Mountain West.”

Stanford’s second-ranked women’s basketball team will not play its scheduled home game Monday against San Diego. The team is looking for a place to practice.

The NHL hasn’t announced a date for the start of training camp but the Sharks have said they would look into alternate sites if needed. Several Sharks players have been holding informal workouts at the team facility in small groups.",BreitBart,-1
Ted Cruz Hammers Alyssa Milano On Coronavirus Aid: ‘Every Senate Dem Voted to Block Relief’,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R, TX) called out leftist actress Alyssa Milano for her attack on Republican lawmakers blocking a recent coronavirus relief bill after she ignored months of Democrats blocking similar financial relief bills.

Alyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday to slap congressional Republicans for blocking a minimum wage hike and a coronavirus relief bill for working-class families. Milano posted her tweet as a reply to an earlier tweet by Sen. Cruz, in which he noted the statistics proving that the Democrats are now the party of the super-rich, coastal elites while the GOP has become the party of working class Americans.

This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 29, 2020

The Charmed star questioned Cruz’ contention that the GOP is now the party of the working classes by noting that the GOP had blocked the coronavirus bill. “This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down,” Milnao tweeted on Sunday.

It is not exactly clear what bills Milano was speaking about but it is possible she was referring to the latest $15 Minimum Wage increase that died in the Senate. And she could be referring to Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s decision back in October to ignore Democrat Chuck Schumer’s attempt to force the upper chamber to discuss a second $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

Schumer wanted to debate his relief bill when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was being confirmed. It would have restored the $600-per-week federal unemployment boost and would have sent another $1,200 stimulus check to Americans.

But Senator Cruz quickly pushed back. The Texas Senator noted that Milano conveniently ignored the many months that Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate blocked the GOP’s $500 billion coronavirus aid bill.

“Alyssa, facts matter,” Cruz tweeted back to Milano. “Dems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief. EVERY SINGLE Senate Dem voted to block relief—Pelosi refuses even to talk—bc they believe maximizing economic pain helped Biden & it helps Dems in GA. & they trust the press to cover for them.”

"Joy Behar: If Hillary Clinton Won, U.S. Would Not Be Number One in Coronavirus Cases, Deaths",['Pam Key'],"Co-host Joy Behar said on Monday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View” that if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election, the United States would not be “number one in the world in COVID cases and COVID deaths.”

During a discussion on Joe Biden’s all-female communication team picks, Behar said, “I think Joe Biden is now demonstrating correctly that women can run things really well, and we’re all going to be a witness to it. He’s got Kamala Harris in the second position, you know, that’s the first time we’ve seen that. Let the world see how well women can do when put in the spot when they can do the job.”

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, “Joy, to your point, we know that women leaders have done really well when it comes to the pandemic response, right? Think about Australia and New Zealand. They’re proven to be effective leaders time and time again. If you look at any study, and I mean Harvard has a tremendous amount of data on this, women have in comparison to men, I hate to say it, but it’s true, have more leadership skills when given the opportunity. Unfortunately, oftentimes we’re not.”

Behar said, “Don’t we all believe at this point — I know I do, if Hillary Clinton were president instead of Trump for the last four years, we would not have — we would not be number one in the world in COVID cases and COVID deaths.”

She continued, “I just believe that. I don’t think Hillary would have lied to the American people. She would have been interviewed by Bob Woodward, and she would have said, this is a terrible thing, and we have to clamp down on it right away. I know she would have done that.”

"Hundreds Gather to Protest Oregon Gym’s $90,000 Coronavirus Fine",['Katherine Rodriguez'],"Hundreds of people gathered in an Oregon neighborhood to protest the $90,000 fine slapped on a local gym for defying Gov. Kate Brown’s coronavirus closure order.

Protesters gathered in front of a dark, grey house with a sign on the door warning trespassers to keep out, the Salem Statesman Journal reported.

The house is owned by a safety and health enforcement manager who worked for the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Organizers of the rally accused the manager of being the inspector who deemed Courthouse Club and Fitness to be unsafe.

“If you’re in that house, we’re asking you to stand with the people … because if you don’t stand with us, we’re going to go through some real difficult times,” protest organizer Joey Gibson said.

Brown’s order made it a requirement for gyms and fitness centers, as well as other businesses, to close between November 18 and December 2 to respond to and stop the rising level of coronavirus cases.

Courthouse Club Fitness stated in a now-deleted post on its Facebook page that it would remain open and received a $90,000 fine just more than a week later.

State health officials said the fine was calculated from the citations of each of the four fitness clubs’ facilities.

“The total penalty for each individual inspection is $22,500,” said Mark Peterson, acting spokesman for OSHA. “That’s a willful penalty of $17,500 for being open to the public and a separate $5,000 penalty for violating the Red Warning Notices that we posted at each location late last week.”

The closures are expected to last until December 2, although Brown said “extreme risk” counties with high coronavirus case numbers will face continued restrictions.",BreitBart,-1
Stacey Abrams Voter Registration Group Denies Impropriety,['Kyle Morris'],"Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State, resurrected a tired and false claim against the New Georgia Project’s legitimate efforts to register eligible Georgians to participate in elections in a press conference held Monday morning, November 30th.

Nse Ufot, Executive Director of the New Georgia Project said:

As Georgians are turning out in record numbers to have their voices heard at the polls, the Secretary of State is resorting to desperate attempts to smear law-abiding organizations and scare eligible Georgians from registering to vote in critical upcoming elections. We will not be deterred. This attack on our organization comes at a time when people across the country have witnessed the strength of our program and the collective power of a new Georgia electorate that embraces a system of inclusivity and opportunity for all Georgians. The timing is not accidental.

The organization also stated that it will “continue its mission to register eligible voters in advance of the December 7th deadline” in its efforts to make sure that Georgia residents “have their voices heard at the polls and freely and fairly cast their ballots for those who would represent them.”

Raffensperger announced earlier Monday that his office will launch an investigation into voting groups accused of encouraging non-Georgia residents to register to vote in the runoff elections, which are set to take place on January 5.

“We have opened an investigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absentee ballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994,” Raffensperger said during a press conference, adding:

Voting in Georgia when you are not a resident of Georgia is a felony, and encouraging college kids to commit felonies with no regard for what [it] might mean for them is despicable. These third-party groups have a responsibility to not encourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.

Other organizations set to face scrutiny from the investigation include America Votes, Operation New Voter Registration Georgia, and Vote Forward.

Last week, Abrams announced that 900,000 Georgians had requested a mail-in ballot for the runoff elections between Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and her Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock, and another between Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and his Democrat opponent Jon Ossoff.

Interestingly, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Warnock served as the CEO of The New Georgia Project until February of this year.

“Warnock was listed as CEO of the New Georgia Project from 2017 until Feb. 21, 2020, according to the group’s corporate filings,” the report stated. “He has been identified as the New Georgia Project’s chairman and spokesman in media reports and has said he organized voter mobilization drives for the group, including a push to register 80,000 new minority voters in 2014.”",BreitBart,-1
FNC’s Geraldo Rivera: Trump Must Stop Attacking Election Results — ‘Enough Is Enough Now’,['Pam Key'],"Fox News Channel’s Geraldo Rivera called on President Donald Trump to stop attacking the presidential election as fraudulent because it could cost the Republican Party the Georgia Senate races and control of the Senate during an appearance on Monday’s broadcast of “The Story.”

Rivera said, “If people lose faith in Georgia’s electoral system and not show up, then they will be gifting Democrats control of the United States Senate. The stakes are so very high. They are astronomical. You know, as a person who has been accused of giving the president too much of the benefit of the doubt, I can’t imagine why the Republican senators aren’t rallying around the Georgia Republicans – the secretary of state and the governor there – and saying that, ‘The system in Georgia will work. You got to vote. Everything is at stake here.’ Rather than attacking the system, not only in Georgia but nationwide, undermines faith in the system, discourages people.”

He continued, “I think that the president is on the wrong course here. I think he has got to take a real gut check between now and Saturday. With all due respect, and you know I love the guy, but enough is enough now.”

He added, “This is the job he has now as the head of the GOP, as the commander-in-chief of the country – he’s gotta rally the voters in Georgia. Control of the Senate is in the balance now, and if he allows his personal, you know, annoyance with the secretary of state and Governor Kemp to rule, then I think it’s going to be a devastating loss for the Republican Party.”

Judge Orders GA County to Stop Software Update on Voting Machines,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A U.S. district judge issued a federal court order to stop officials in Georgia from performing a software update that would “wipe” or “reset” Fulton County voting machines, according to the order, which was shared by attorney Lin Wood.

The attorney added that the order was later “reversed” when a judge deemed Georgia counties to be in control of the voting machines.

“Time to obey the law. Stop the destruction of evidence,” tweeted Wood at several Georgia officials on Sunday, sharing an image of the federal court order.

“Plaintiffs contend that union county officials have advised that they are going to wipe or reset the voting machines of all data and bring the count back to zero on Monday, November 30,” the court order stated. It went on:

To the extent Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order to preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data, their motion is granted. Defendants are ordered to maintain the status quo and are temporarily enjoined from wiping or resetting any voting machines in the State of Georgia until further order of the Court.

The order was signed by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten on Sunday.

“Our Republican recount monitors at the World Congress Center waited today for four hours while Fulton County elections officials ‘updated the software,'” tweeted the Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, David Shafer.

“The explanation given to me – ‘just the usual Fulton County incompetence’ – is completely unacceptable,” Shafer added.

“Thankfully [Lin Wood] this afternoon obtained an emergency federal court order prohibiting any ‘wiping’ or ‘resetting’ of the voting machines,” continued Shafer in a follow-up tweet.

Wood is the Georgia-based attorney most famous for successfully suing the media on behalf of Richard Jewell in the 90s, as well as on behalf of Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann last year.

“It is outrageous that we cannot rely on Fulton County elections officials to do their jobs without unexplained four hour delays, interventions by private attorneys and federal court orders,” Shafer added.

The court order, however, was apparently rescinded, as Wood later announced in a follow-up tweet that a judge had reversed the federal order based on the Defendants’ claim that Georgia counties control voting machines.

“What??? Judge reversed order based on Defendants’ claim that GA Counties control voting machines,” wrote Wood. “Machines are owned by State & [Georgia Secretary of State] administers state laws on elections.”

“Why are GA officials determined to wipe these machines clean be resetting them?” the attorney inquired.

“On November 24, a litigation hold notice was served on Fulton County which demanded that all evidence related to voting machines be preserved,” explained Wood in another tweet.

“Scrubbing the machines or tampering with them in any manner should NOT be occurring,” he declared.

"Exclusive — Blackburn: ‘Vital’ that Georgians Reelect Loeffler, Perdue to Protect Senate ‘Firewall’ Against Left",['Matthew Boyle'],"Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart News exclusively that the upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5 represent a “classic battle between freedom and socialism.”

Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) will face off against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock respectively for both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats and potentially control of the majority in the U.S. Senate at stake. Republicans will definitely have at least 50 seats in the Senate next year, and Democrats will definitely have at least 48. If the Democrats were to take both of these seats, then the Senate would be tied at 50-50 and whoever the vice president of the United States is next year would cut the tie and determine the majority control in the Senate.

Since Democrat presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads in enough states to win the electoral college, that would probably be now-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)—his running mate—should challenges from President Donald Trump fail. If Trump were to succeed in his election challenges, then Vice President Mike Pence would cut ties in the Senate. But as it stands now, barring a miraculous legal challenge comeback by Trump, in a 50-50 Senate it would be Harris cutting ties and steering control of the upper chamber of Congress to the Democrat Party.

Blackburn argued in an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel that the Democrats would use victories in these Georgia Senate races if they got them to implement a radical leftist and socialist agenda.

“What you have is a classic battle between freedom and socialism,” Blackburn said. “Chuck Schumer has said, in his glee on Election Day, he said first we go ‘take’ Georgia—not we go earn the vote, not we work in Georgia to win, but ‘take.’ They are planning, the left is planning to ‘take’ Georgia. Then Schumer said they will ‘change’ America. The ‘change’ they are planning for America is adding justices to the Supreme Court, changing the Supreme Court, giving statehood to D.C. Now, D.C. is not as big as Atlanta, but D.C. is going to be a state if the Democrats get their way. Statehood for Puerto Rico, and making sure they take health insurance away from 153 million Americans and 57 million Medicare enrollees and putting everyone into a Medicaid-style program that is run by the government. They want to implement the Green New Deal, and they want to give felons the right to vote—and that is the plan just for their first 100 days. This is what they are going to do if they are given the opportunity. Bear in mind what they plan to do is use Georgia and then force their will not only on Georgians but also on the American people.”

Blackburn urged all Republicans and Trump supporters to get out and vote for Perdue and Loeffler, saying it is “vital” for them to do so since the “left is organized” in a systemic way to try to manufacture wins for Ossoff and Perdue.

“It is absolutely vital,” Blackburn said when asked how critical it is for Trump supporters to back Loeffler and Perdue. “The left is organized because they cannot get by with implementing all the stuff they’re wanting to foist upon Americans unless they win Georgia. The Senate has been the firewall. They’re the ones that have blocked a lot of stuff. It is so important that we make certain that we carry these races in Georgia. I guarantee you I am going to be out there working every single day—night and day—to make certain that we win these races. You just think about the people who would be heading these various committees. Do you really want Bernie Sanders chairing the Senate Budget Committee? Do you really want somebody like Elizabeth Warren leading the Senate Armed Services Committee? Do you really want someone like Dick Durbin as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Most Georgians would say no I’m not comfortable with that because these are individuals who are too far left for me. So the only thing that stands between that happening and not is for the people of Georgia to go elect Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.”

Pence is headed back to Georgia on Friday, and Trump is heading there on Saturday, to campaign with Loeffler and Perdue. Several other top GOP stars have already been to the state and more are planning trips there over the next month.

Kemp Rejects Call to Strengthen GA Recount with Emergency Powers,['Joshua Caplan'],"“Georgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections. The Secretary of State, who is an elected constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order,” Cody Hall, a spokesperson for Kemp, said in a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “As the governor has said repeatedly, he will continue to follow the law and encourage the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps – including a sample audit of signatures – to restore trust and address serious issues that have been raised.”

Earlier Monday, President Trump criticized Kemp for failing to tackle the “goldmine of fraud” in the state’s presidential election by not signature matching mail-in ballots.“Why won’t Governor Brian Kemp, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,” the president tweeted in reference to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).

….Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots. You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2020

“Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!” he added.

Raffensperger has said signatures matching is now impossible due to ballots being separated from their outer envelopes.

President Trump also suggested that the state’s election could have been plagued by other types of irregularities.

“Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,” he tweeted. “You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do.”

Shortly after President Trump’s comments, his campaign announced that it sent a fifth request to Raffensperger for a signature audit.

“It is not possible for you to accurately certify the results in the presidential race from the November 3, 2020, election until and unless there is a thorough audit of the signatures, which we have now requested four times in writing prior to this request. You cannot in good faith conclude the ongoing statutory recount until you have instituted a signature matching audit,” said Trump campaign lawyer Ray Smith.

“Until the signatures are matched, the vote count in Georgia is a complete fraud,” added former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. “There is no way of knowing which ballots are honest and which ballots are fraudulent.”",BreitBart,-1
Democrat Jon Ossoff Signals Support for Lockdowns: ‘It's Time to Trust the Experts’,['Ashley Oliver'],"Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to address coronavirus spread if public health experts indicate a need for “stronger mitigation measures,” remarking that “it’s time to trust the experts.”

Ossoff, who is challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia’s race for U.S. Senate, told CNN host Dana Bash, “The problem we’ve had all year is that politicians have been suppressing and ignoring public health advice. It’s time to trust the experts, listen to public health professionals in a public health crisis.”

Bash said the White House Coronavirus Task Force has already indicated that “this is the moment to dramatically increase mitigation” due to a resurgence of the virus. Bash asked Ossoff, “So would you support harsher restrictions in Georgia, like closing restaurants and businesses temporarily?”

The Georgia Democrat responded, “I think we should follow the expertise of public health experts like those of the CDC, which is based here in Georgia, and if that is the consensus of the public health community, we need to take that advice very seriously.”

Bash further pressed, “So if they said, ‘Shut things down temporarily,’ you’d be all for it?” to which Ossoff replied, “If the CDC and its leadership gave us strong indication that those kinds of stronger mitigation measures are necessary to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, it would be malpractice for politicians to ignore that advice.”

The Worldometer reports that Georgia currently has 162,886 active cases of the novel coronavirus, or 1.5 percent, of the state’s population of 10,617,423. At its peak, Georgia saw 6,209 new daily cases reported on November 21. Since then, new daily cases have substantially dropped, with the latest data showing 1,952 new daily cases reported on November 29.

Ossoff said the spread of the virus “is out of control” and claimed people, including incumbent Perdue, have disregarded advice of public health experts. “The problem is we’ve ignored the public health experts, so I’ll be listening to them and not to political consultants, pollsters, or folks looking out for their own financial interests, like my opponent.”

Perdue has advocated for a phased reopening of businesses and described the lockdown measures Ossoff supports as “overreaching” following Ossoff’s CNN interview:

If you think the overreaching lockdowns in states like New York and California are scary, know that Jon @Ossoff would support the very same policies – for the entire country. pic.twitter.com/RADSX01uMO — David Perdue (@Perduesenate) November 30, 2020

In the same interview, Bash also asked Ossoff about his recent endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, and whether Ossoff wants Sanders to campaign with him in the weeks leading up to the January 5 Senate runoff election. Ossoff said that while he has not had that conversation with Sanders, he welcomes Sanders’ support.

Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler expressed concern after Ossoff’s television appearance that the Georgia Democrat’s support for lockdowns aligns with the socialist ideology’s tendency for government dependency.

“On January 5th, Georgians have a clear choice between socialism and freedom,” Sigler said. “Jon Ossoff supports a national lockdown and seeks to keep the entire country shut inside until we are completely dependent on the federal government for everything. … We must reject Jon Ossoff and the radical Democrats’ socialist agenda.”

Georgia’s Fulton County Recount Delayed After Dominion Server Crash,['Hannah Bleau'],"The recount requested by President Trump’s campaign in Georgia’s Fulton County experienced a delay after a Dominion Voting Systems mobile server crashed on Sunday, according to Fulton County officials.

“Technicians from Dominion have been dispatched to resolve the issue,” Fulton County officials said in a statement after the server crashed on Sunday. “The Georgia Secretary of State’s office has also been alerted to the issue and is aware of efforts to resolve the problem.”

Dominion has remained at the center of claims of error and fraud in the 2020 election. While Sidney Powell is not formally part of President Trump’s legal team, she participated in a joint press conference with his campaign prior to Thanksgiving and detailed the purported issues with the voting machines.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Powell argued that U.S. votes were being counted overseas, and that Dominion voting machines and Smartmatic software were controlled by foreign interests, manipulating algorithms to change the results. Powell noted specifically that Smartmatic’s owners included two Venezuelan nationals, whom she alleged had ties to the regime of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. The legal team alleged that there were statistical anomalies, such as huge batches of votes for Biden, that could not be explained except as manipulation — which, they alleged, happened in the wee hours of the morning as vote-counting had stalled. (The companies have disputed these allegations vigorously.)

Powell filed lawsuits challenging the election results in Georgia and Michigan last week, which contained the allegations she previewed at the press conference.

“Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia,” Powell alleged, adding that “especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County.”

Researchers have also questioned the reliability of the voting systems, noting that they “register votes in bar codes that the human eye cannot decipher” which could give voters “printouts that accurately spell out the names of the candidates they picked, but, because of a hack, the bar codes do not reflect those choices.”

In October, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) warned that Georgia’s newly implemented Dominion voting system was vulnerable to cyberattacks. It also noted that Texas rejected the Dominion equipment due to “multiple hardware issues.”

Top Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (MA), Amy Klobuchar (MN), and Ron Wyden (OR) also signaled concern over Dominion’s technology in 2019. In a letter to the private equity firms controlling the top U.S. election technology companies, the senators expressed concern over “vulnerabilities and a lack of transparency in the election technology industry and the poor condition of voting machines and other election technology equipment.”

However, Dominion has fervently denied what it called “false assertions about vote switching and software issues” with their voting systems, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) has dismissed Powell’s accusations.

Trump Urges Georgia Governor to Strengthen Recount,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump on Monday warned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) of a “goldmine of fraud” without signature matching for mail-in ballots in the state recount.

“Why won’t Governor Brian Kemp, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,” Trump asked, referring to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).

Trump channeled anger from Georgia state Republicans about the election results and the subsequent hand recounts that did not revisit the signature verification.

“Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!” he wrote.

Raffensperger has claimed that matching the signatures is no longer possible because the ballots have been separated from the outer envelope.

But Trump argued that verifying the signatures in the recount would eliminate any potential fraud — both in the 2020 election and the Georgia Senate runoff election.

“It will be a ‘goldmine’ of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state,” Trump wrote.

The president also questioned whether the number of envelopes matched up with the number of ballots cast in the Georgia 2020 election, suggesting there were other signs of fraud.

“Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,” he wrote. “You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do.”",BreitBart,-1
Newt Gingrich: America's Future Depends on Georgia's Senate Races,['Robert Kraychik'],"America’s future depends on the outcomes of the elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia, said former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) on Monday, offering his remarks on SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

Marlow asked about demoralization among conservatives and Republicans in Georgia rooted in mistrust of the electoral and political systems.

“A lot of people in the audience are discouraged,” Marlow stated. “I don’t think it’s the majority, by any means, but there’s certainly a number of people who’ve been pretty vocal that they’re discouraged. They think the election process — if it’s not going to be legitimate — then there’s no point in voting and they don’t want to vote. They’re going protest in Georgia by not voting. I would like to hope it’s a small number of people, but a small number of people could swing the whole election. Do you have a message for those people?”

Gingrich urged Georgians to vote and volunteer as poll watchers.

LISTEN:

Gingrich continued with this advice, “My message is very simple. The future of the United States depends on the outcome of the Georgia Senate races. If you don’t want a radical left-wing America dominated by left-wing judges with massive tax increases, with a policy, frankly, of appeasing China, and you don’t want that kind of future, you have to go out and vote. And then frankly, you have to volunteer as a poll watcher and make sure they don’t steal the election. But I think these things are vital and I don’t think we should in any way underestimate how really important the Georgia Senate race.”

The 2020 election “may be the biggest Presidential theft since Adams and Clay robbed Andrew Jackson in 1824,” wrote Gingrich on Friday via Twitter.

Gingrich contrasted 1824’s presidential election with 2020’s.

“In 1824, Andrew Jackson had At 40 percent of the popular vote, but the guys who came in number two and three combined in the House of Representatives of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay decided that even though Jackson got the most votes, he wouldn’t be president,” Gingrich explained. “So Jackson spent the next four years attacking them for representing a corrupt establishment and decisively beat Adams in 1828, and really the caused a dramatic uprising against the old order because people were just sick of it.”

Gingrich warned Democrats focus on election mechanics while Republicans focus on political campaigning. He highlighted get-out-the-vote efforts funded by Mark Zuckerberg and other left-wing billionaires and Democrat-driven election law changes as examples of Democrats’ focus on electioneering.

“You have to think of two parallel projects,” determined Gingrich. “There is the campaign, which is what the Republicans focus on, and there is the election, which is what the Democrats focus on. If we don’t find a way to have an honest election, the campaign won’t matter, because we will be drowned in ballots that are illegally gathered [through] harvested ballots.”

Gingrich concluded, “These two Senate seats are the margin between containing Biden and empowering Biden.”",BreitBart,-1
VIDEO: Trump Supporters Rally Outside GA Secretary of State's Home,['Amy Furr'],"About 200 of President Donald Trump’s supporters rallied outside Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s (R) Atlanta home on Saturday to protest the election results.

“Trucks flying Trump and ‘Stop the Steal’ flags drove up and down the street outside of Secretary Brad Raffensperger’s property, honking their horns as they passed by,” Fox 5 reported.

Organizer Ursula Christie told the outlet she wanted Raffensperger to know “we are silent no more and we want him to know that we are watching and we are listening and we are aware of the actions being taken.”

Raffensperger, a Republican, said he voted for Trump but has received criticism for his handling of the election.

“On Thanksgiving Day, Trump called Georgia’s election was [sic] part of a ‘fraudulent system’ and said Raffensperger was an ‘enemy of the people,'” the Fox 5 report continued.

During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on November 18, Raffensperger dismissed allegations of voter fraud in his state but acknowledged the possibility of clerical errors:

We have not seen any widespread voter fraud. The president has picked up some votes in a few of the counties that made some clerical errors. It wasn’t the machines. But at the end of the day, he started with 14,000. He’s about 12,000 now. But we’re finishing up, waiting for a few more counties to get back to us, large counties, but I don’t believe at the end of the day it will change the total results.

When asked if he believed former Vice President Joe Biden would win Georgia, Raffensperger said “Yes, I believe that’s the way it will turn out.”

However, in a Friday tweet, Trump said “Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous ‘80,000,000 votes’ were not fraudulently or illegally obtained.”

“When you see what happened in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia & Milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he’s got a big unsolvable problem!” he concluded.",BreitBart,-1

Many Trump supporters are enraged by their state GOP representatives in Georgia, accusing them of failing to back the president in a contentious recount in which former Vice President Joe Biden still holds a roughly 12,000 vote lead.

But Trump said that a boycott would only help Democrats.

“Otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people,” he wrote.

As Breitbart News reported, Democrats are already exploiting tensions in the state by spreading the message that Republicans should not back the Georgia Republican candidates because of their failure to fight for the president.

Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. has also opposed any boycotts.

“That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people,” he wrote on Twitter. “We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.”

“I will be in Georgia on Saturday!” he wrote, referring to his planned rally for December 5.

The president is watching the race closely as Democrats work to flip the state and seize control of the Senate.

Hollywood Storms Georgia: Kevin Bacon Hosting Celebrity Fundraiser for Pro-Democrat Group,['David Ng'],"Georgia is ground zero in the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C., as control of the U.S. Senate now hinges on the outcome of the two Senate runoff races in the Peach State. With the Senate majority leadership within his reach, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” Now Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are reportedly the latest Hollywood celebrities to lend their star power to Democrats in Georgia, hoping to boost the chances of candidates Raphael Warrnock and Jon Ossoff and turn the Senate blue.

The acting power couple will join comedian Billy Eichner and Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. in a fundraiser for Swing Left, one of many progressive organizations that is mobilizing Democratic turnout in Georgia, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Maze Runner producer Ellen Goldsmith-Vein will co-host the December 3 event.

Swing Left is among the many progressive groups that have set their sights on Georgia ahead of the state’s January 5 runoffs. The organization, which was founded in the wake of President Trump’s 2016 victory, has specialized in recruiting celebrities to push its agenda, including Broadway and Homeland star Mandy Patinkin.

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick teamed up with Swing Left in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, participating in podcasts and donating money to the group.

Hollywood celebrities have made Georgia their top political priority in their effort to push Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock across the finish line. A-list stars including George Clooney and Will Smith have poured money into the races, while actors Kumail Nanjiani and Sophia Bush are spearheading WinBothSeats, an initiative to get out the minority vote for Democrats.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is holding a Veep reunion next month to raise money for America Votes, the left-wing group that is working to boost Democratic chances in Georgia’s runoffs. Other stars pushing Georgia Democrats on social media include Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing.

The White House clarified after Trump’s remarks that he would campaign in the state on Saturday, December 5.

Both Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face a runoff election on January 5, as Republicans try to hold on to their Senate majority.

“Maybe I’ll go twice. That’s very important that we win those races. These are great people,” Trump said.

Trump described Perdue’s Democrat opponent, Jon Ossoff, as a “lightweight” and Loeffler’s opponent, Raphael Warnock, as “either a communist or a socialist. I cannot figure that out yet.”

“This is not for Georgia,” Trump said.

Trump said that he warned Perdue and Loeffler of the voting system in the state of Georgia.

“Listen, you have a fraudulent system. You have to be very careful,” he recalled telling them.

Trump said that because of the coronavirus pandemic, he would probably host an outdoor rally in Georgia, most likely at an airport.

“They’re looking for the right site,” he said.

Trump disputed a reporter’s assertion that this was his last Thanksgiving in the White House.

“Well we don’t know what is last — if you look at what’s going on. … They’re finding tremendous discrepancies in the votes, and nobody believes those numbers. Those numbers are incorrect numbers.”

He predicted that more evidence of voter fraud would come out in a number of weeks.

“We’ll see what happens. Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has really come to represent,” he said.

Trump said he would continue fighting the election results, noting that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris opposed his policy of “America First.”

“You can’t have somebody assume office and already they want to get rid of ‘America First.’ … You know why?” he asked. “Because China doesn’t want it.”

One reporter asked Trump if he would concede the presidential election if the electoral college voted for Biden on December 14.

“It’s going to be a very hard thing to concede because we know there was massive fraud, so as to whether or not I can get this apparatus moving this quickly, because time is not on our side. Everything else is on our side. Facts are on our side,” he said. “This was a massive fraud.”",BreitBart,-1

Abrams’ organization Fair Fight is enlisting celebrities like Selena Gomez, Yara Shahidi, Issa Rae, Keke Palmer and Steph Curry for voting videos, as well as dumping millions of dollars to assist over a dozen organizations in their efforts ahead of the runoffs.

“I believe very much in the power of celebrity to cut through the noise of politics,” Abrams said last week.

Celebrities also now believe that they have a vested interest in the turning the state blue, as tax incentives have brought Hollywood productions from California to Georgia in recent years, bringing the celebrities and other staff to the traditionally red state.

“Being someone who worked in Georgia for two years while I shot [Netflix series] Insatiable, I’m really aware of how powerful and impactful the organizers are,” said actress and political activist Alyssa Milano.

New Georgia Project executive director Nse Ufot echoed those sentiments.

“We’ve been talking for quite a bit of time about how we are trying to change the culture of voting — what better way to do that than by partnering with culture workers, people who are literally responsible for helping us shift the narrative and tell better stories about ourselves,” said Ufot. “Our state is growing by leaps and bounds because of an influx of storytellers and people who support them. I think that that could be a secret weapon as we think about the new Georgia.”

LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Marxist political organization Black Voters Matter, echoed those sentiments as well, and claimed, “we’re not the headquarters for Southern white male racists” now that Hollywood has imposed itself.

“We’ve seen this transition — Georgia is the number one place for film productions, so this city has become more internationalized, I think one,” said Brown. “I think it’s been attractive to bringing diverse folks to the state.”

"Sidney Powell Files Lawsuits Challenging Election Results in Georgia, Michigan",['Joel B. Pollak'],"Attorney Sidney Powell filed lawsuits Wednesday challenging the results of the presidential vote in Georgia and Michigan, alleging “ballot stuffing,” which she alleges was “amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software created and run by domestic and foreign actors.”

Powell made similar claims last week at a press conference with President Donald Trump’s legal team. She was attacked by critics who claimed that she could not prove what she alleged. The legal team distanced themselves from her on Sunday, saying that her claims had gone beyond the evidence they had seen or could prove in court.

Powell — who also defended Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, pardoned by President Trump on Wednesday — accepted the decision but pressed ahead regardless.

She alleges in Georgia:

Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia. Especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County. This scheme and artifice to defraud affected tens of thousands of votes in Georgia alone and “rigged” the election in Georgia for Joe Biden.

Powell makes similar allegations in Michigan, noting an “especially egregious range of conduct in Wayne County and the City of Detroit, though this conduct occurred throughout the State at the direction of Michigan state election officials.”

Powell traces the fraud to “software and hardware from Dominion Voting Systems Corporation,” which she said derives from software created by “Smartmatic Corporation, which became Sequoia in the United States.”

She goes on to allege, in both the Georgia and the Michigan complaints, “Smartmatic and Dominion were founded by foreign oligarchs and dictators to ensure computerized ballot-stuffing and vote manipulation to whatever level was needed to make certain Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez never lost another election.”

Based on the affidavit of a whistleblower, Powell alleges that the systems were designed to make ballot-stuffing hard to detect by a “simple audit.” They were manipulated, she says, by people who had access to the systems.

In Georgia, she says:

[V]ideo from the State Farm Arena in Fulton County shows that on November 3rd after the polls closed, election workers falsely claimed a water leak required the facility to close. All poll workers and challengers were evacuated for several hours at about 10:00 PM. However, several election workers remained unsupervised and unchallenged working at the computers for the voting tabulation machines until after 1:00 AM.

She also claimed that “the Dominion software was accessed by agents acting on behalf of China and Iran in order to monitor and manipulate elections, including the most recent US general election in 2020.” One expert, she says, “concludes that hundreds of thousands of votes that were cast for President Trump in the 2020 general election were transferred to former Vice-President Biden.”

And she adds that “Georgia’s election officials and poll workers exacerbated and helped, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the Dominion system carry out massive voter manipulation by refusing to observe statutory safeguards for absentee ballots. Election officials failed to verify signatures and check security envelopes. They barred challengers from observing the count, which also facilitated the fraud.”

In Michigan, Powell says, in addition to problems with Dominion, there were “additional categories of ‘traditional’ voting fraud and Michigan Election Code violations, supplemented by healthy doses of harassment, intimidation, discrimination, abuse and even physical removal of Republican poll challengers to eliminate any semblance of transparency, objectivity or fairness from the vote counting process.”

Powell alleges, citing expert testimony, that Michigan saw tens of thousands of “excess voters,” where unassigned or blank absentee ballots were filled out by election workers, and nearly all of those votes went to Joe Biden. She also alleges that in four precincts, more ballots were counted than could be physically processed during a two and-a-half hour interval Nov. 4.

She alleges that glitches in Michigan — such as one that mistakenly counted 6,000 votes for Biden in Antrim County — were always in Biden’s favor.

There are enough ballots affected, Powell argues, for the courts to set aside the results of the 2020 election in each state.

Attorney L. Lin Wood is also among those listed in the filings.

"Tim Scott: Trump Should Campaign in Georgia, He’s ‘the Person That Makes Sure’ Those Seats Stay Republican",['Ian Hanchett'],"On Wednesday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Hannity,” Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) argued President Donald Trump should go to Georgia to campaign for Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and talk about his accomplishments for black voters and that “Trump is the person that makes sure those two seats remain in the Republican column in the Senate.”

Scott said, “[T]here is only one giant in the party, and that is President Donald Trump. Donald Trump comes to our great state of Georgia, and here’s what happens, President Trump has a chance to talk about his enormous support for historically black colleges and universities. One of the reasons why President Trump’s African American numbers went up…this election cycle is because he brought the highest level of funding to HBCUs, made the funding permanent. He passed criminal justice reform, making up for the disaster of the 1994 crime bill brought to you by Joe Biden. He’s the one who made sure that we focus on sickle cell anemia research. But for every single Georgian, he brought tax reform. He reset the regulatory state so that we created more jobs, not lost more jobs. President Trump is the person that makes sure those two seats remain in the Republican column in the Senate.”

Democrat Jon Ossoff Claims ‘Oversight’ in Omitting Payment from Chinese Communist-Linked Company,['Kristina Wong'],"Georgia Senate Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff’s campaign is claiming its omission from its financial disclosures in May of a payment from a Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked company to Ossoff’s media production company was due to a “paperwork oversight.”

After a political ad asserted that Ossoff ignored rules and hid cash from Chinese communists, an Ossoff campaign spokesperson called it a “paperwork oversight.”

The November 17 Senate Leadership Fund ad said, “Jon Ossoff. A trail of dirty money. Ossoff ignored the rules, hiding cash from Chinese communists.”

The ad was referring to Ossoff’s initial financial disclosure filings for his Senate candidacy in May 2020. That filing showed that his media production company, Insight TWI, received more than $5,000 in the past two years from 21 TV or broadcasting groups from around the world.

Two months later, in July 2020, Ossoff amended that filing to include 32 companies, including PCCW Media Limited — a Hong Kong-based Chinese media company that is partially owned by the Chinese state-run company China Unicom, led by a CCP member.

Ossoff campaign spokesperson Miryam Lipper told FactCheck.org in regard to the ad that Ossoff was not “hiding” the payment and that it was a “paperwork oversight” that was “rectified” after “a normal review of the campaign’s paperwork.”

Lipper also wrote to FactCheck.org, “PCCW does not = Chinese communists.”

However, multiple media reports show direct ties between PCCW Media Limited and the CCP.

PCCW Media Limited is owned by Richard Li — who has spoken out against pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, as well as owned by the Chinese state-owned China Unicom, which is run by CEO Wang Xiaochu, a member of the CCP.

Li has a long track record of supporting Beijing. According to the National Review, in 2016, Li released a public statement that said he was “staunchly opposed to the independence of Hong Kong.”

“Mr. Richard Li and MOOV would like to clearly state that the company and Mr. Li respect freedom of expression,” the statement said. “However, both Mr. Li and the Company are staunchly opposed to the independence of Hong Kong and it is their view that the independence of Hong Kong would not be feasible, and discussing Hong Kong’s independence is a waste of society’s resources.”

At the height of the democracy protests in 2019, Li took out full-page advertisements in seven newspapers to call for the restoration of “the social order with the rule of law,” backing the recommendations of Beijing’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, according to the National Review.

And Li’s father, Li Ka-shing, reportedly the richest man in Hong Kong, publicly backed the CCP’s sweeping national security law in 2020 to crack down on critics and dissenters.

Despite Lipper claiming that PCCW Media Limited “does not = Chinese communists,” she still made an effort to distance Ossoff’s company from PCCW.

She claimed PCCW did not directly pay Insight TWI, despite Ossoff’s own filing listing the company as those that paid Insight TWI more than $5,000 in the past two years.

“In some instances, as is the case with PCCW, TWI even licenses the documentaries to distributors like Sky Vision who re-license them to TV stations,” Lipper claimed.

“TWI would never have sold anything to PCCW directly, just received a royalty check from Sky Vision when PCCW ran TWI’s two investigations of ISIS war crimes,” she added.

She also asserted the payment did not mean PCCW controlled Ossoff.

The structure of Insight TWI “doesn’t leave any room for this notion that he is somehow controlled by these groups in the nefarious way they try to imply,” she told FactCheck.org.

FactCheck.org also said support for the ad’s “charges is weak” and called PCCW Media Limited “supposed” “Chinese communists.”

Rand Paul Urges Georgia Libertarians to ‘Vote Republican’ in Runoff,['Amy Furr'],"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is encouraging Libertarians in Georgia to vote Republican in the January Senate runoff race.

“One of the things that I’ve taken upon myself is to try to encourage… there was a little over 100,000 people who voted for Shane Hazel, the Libertarian candidate, and I think those people can find a place and reason to vote for Republicans,” he said Monday on Fox News.

Paul continued:

Look, I get fed up with the Republicans not spending money wisely and adding to our debt, but they are better than the Democrats. Even if only sometimes marginally so. But on some things, like packing the court and D.C. statehood, Republicans will help to protect the country from all branches of government being controlled by the Democrats. So, I think there is some argument… some of these 100,000 Libertarians to actually vote Republican and I’m gonna be spending some time trying to encourage them to vote Republican in the runoff.

Democrats from outside the state are trying to create division among Republicans in Georgia.

“The Democrats then intend to exploit those divisions to try to drive down turnout among President Donald Trump’s supporters in the runoff for the two U.S. Senate seats that will decide which party controls the upper chamber of Congress next year,” Breitbart News reported.

“Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing back on these efforts, calling them ‘deceitful campaign tactics’ designed to ‘manipulate voters’ in Georgia,” it continued.

A recent ad by the Georgia Republican Party said illegal aliens will earn the right to vote if Americans do not vote in the runoff elections.

“When the radicals say ‘change America,’ this is what they mean: opening the border, illegal immigrants voting, total Democrat control,” the narrator states:

Democrat Jaime Harrison Launches PAC for Runoffs After Record-Breaking Loss in South Carolina,['Ashley Oliver'],"Democrat Jaime Harrison, who ran against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and lost in the most expensive defeat in U.S. Senate race history, announced Tuesday the launch of a political action committee (PAC) aimed at boosting Democrats in Georgia’s Senate runoff election.

Harrison, who has also been floated as the next Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, announced the launch of Dirt Road PAC Monday morning on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Harrison said he first plans to raise money for Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who are challenging Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in Georgia’s high-profile Senate runoff races on January 5:

The new fundraising effort comes on the heels of Harrison outspending any Senate candidate in U.S. history, at $104.1 million, in an attempt to oust Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Graham. Harrison lost to Graham by a definitive margin of ten points.

“Rome wasn’t built in a day; South Carolina won’t flip overnight, but if you sustain the investment in these communities, we’ll see the change that is so necessary and so needed,” Harrison said on MSNBC as he rationalized his continued pursuit of political donations.

Host Joe Scarborough praised Harrison’s Senate bid and questioned if South Carolina was “just a state that Democrats aren’t going to be able to win for a very long time”:

You had so many advantages in this race. You had all the money any candidate could ever dream of having. You ran what most thought was a very effective race against an ineffective opponent, who at times seemed desperate, seemed whiney, had broken his promise to South Carolina voters time and time again … and yet Lindsey Graham won the race handily. Is South Carolina just a state that Democrats aren’t going to be able to win for a very long time?

Harrison responded by emphasizing that flipping red areas to blue requires a “long-term and sustained approach.”

Harrison’s PAC launch is one of several Democrat fundraising endeavors zoned in on the consequential Georgia runoff races, which will determine which party next controls the Senate majority. Activist Stacey Abrams, who dropped $10 million at the start of the runoffs through her organization Fair Fight, announced Saturday that Fair Fight will pump $2.7 million into smaller groups intending to strengthen their “get-out-the-vote apparatus.”

Other big names stepping in for the runoffs include Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and “Squad” leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

As for Harrison’s PAC, beyond Georgia, the South Carolina Democrat intends to direct funds toward Virginia’s 2021 elections, voter registration efforts, and the 2022 midterm elections.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus Holding ‘Veep’ Reunion to Turn Out Democrats in Georgia Senate Runoffs,['David Ng'],"Georgia is the center of the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C., as control of the U.S. Senate now hinges on the outcome of the two Senate runoff races in the Peach State. With the Senate majority leadership just a couple seats away, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” Now, actress and anti-Trump activist Julia Louis-Dreyfus will re-live her character’s humiliating electoral loss in HBO’s Veep to raise money for Democratic voter turnout in Georgia’s hotly contested runoff elections.

The Veep cast is set to reunite to perform a virtual reading of the episode “Mother,” in which President Selina Meyer loses the Nevada recount and thus the White House. The streaming event on December 6 will serve as a fundraiser for America Votes, a progressive organization that aims to boost votes for Democratic candidates.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who hosted the final night of this year’s Democratic National Convention, posted a promotional video for the event in which she parodied Rudy Giuliani’s recent press conference.

2020 won't stop ripping off #VEEP, so we had to do something about it.

The official invitation states: “Your donation to America Votes directly supports the Georgia-based groups working to educate and turn out voters for December’s critical US Senate runoff elections. Join us to #ShowUpForGeorgia.”

In the Veep episode “Mother,” the Selina Meyer campaign hopes to end the electoral stalemate with the Nevada recount, but things don’t go as planned. The political cliffhanger comes as Meyer’s elderly mother suffers a massive stroke, sending Selina into an emotional tailspin.

Louis-Dreyfus previously held a Veep reunion-fundraiser for Wisconsin Democrats in the run-up to the November 3 election. Key counties in the state are undergoing a recount after Milwaukee and Dane counties saw late surges in votes for former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Georgia runoffs are set to take place January 5.

Fitton: Election Update,['Tom Fitton'],"If you want to effectively express your beliefs about this deliberately chaotic election, I urge you to contact your representatives in your state legislature and Congress. Especially if you live in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona – cesspools of fraud and lawlessness all.

I described what we’re witnessing in an interview with Stephanie Hamill on One America News Network:

Americans see an election that’s been questioned because of substantial allegations of maladministration of the election – that’s a charitable interpretation of it. And they know there’s an air of violence and censorship and suppression if they dare raise questions about it or support the president. We who are defending the rule of law are being lectured about the peaceful transfer of power by the likes of President Obama, who during his transition was actually conspiring against President Trump and spying on his team illicitly.

In her Newsmax television show Sovereign Nation, Michelle Malkin complimented Judicial Watch for our work on elections and suggested that we have earned the right to say, “I told you so.” I take no comfort in that because we have unprecedented fraud occurring across the country.

Michelle asked me what Judicial Watch doing about it. My response:

Our litigators and investigators are figuring out where we can make a stand to preserve the lawful election result. U.S. Code designates this past Tuesday as Election Day. That’s when we’re supposed to select the president. Any votes being counted that arrive after that day should be subject to challenge. And any vote counting that occurs after Election Day should be subject to challenge. When you have a pause in counting, that indicates that fraud has taken place.

This is what I said to my Twitter followers about our activity:

Americans should demand courts and state legislatures and Congress protect free and fair elections! Judicial Watch is conducting independent investigations in PA, GA, AZ, NV, MI, WI!

We don’t know how all of this will play out. The election may well end up in Congress, as I explain in this video:

The electors vote as part of the Electoral College process in the middle of December. Then on January 6, the new Congress is supposed to meet and count the votes and essentially confirm and ratify the Electoral College selection of the president and vice president. Now, if there’s a challenge, you could get a situation where the House, for instance, wants to bless the Biden electors out of Pennsylvania and the Senate wants to reject them. Frankly, I’m not sure what happens next.

We have observed and researched and litigated elections for decades, and, as you might imagine, we are following this one extremely closely. We will be deploying our weapon of choice, the Freedom of Information Act, to uncover the truth.",BreitBart,-1
Sen. Kelly Loeffler Donates $38K 4th Quarter Senate Salary to Charity,['Hannah Bleau'],"Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R), who will face Rev. Raphael Warnock (D) in the forthcoming January 5 runoff, donated all her fourth-quarter salary to ten charitable organizations, benefitting various programs and centers focused on assisting children, the homeless, and struggling families.

Loeffler made good on her pledge to donate her salary to charitable organizations, donating her fourth-quarter $38,000 salary to ten charities, giving $3,800 to each. This quarter, the senator gave to a variety of organizations that “are helping those in need across the state of Georgia.” These include a Christian adoption agency, a foster care center, a community home, and a women’s center, among others.

“Charitable organizations and nonprofits embody the best of Georgia and the best of America, and they play a critical role in fostering thriving communities across our state,” Loeffler said in a statement.

“This quarter, I’m proud to donate my salary to 10 Georgia-based organizations that are on the frontlines lifting Georgians up and providing life-changing resources and support to so many,” she continued.

“As we enter the holiday season, it’s important to give thanks for the selfless sacrifices that so many across our state make for others, and I look forward to seeing all the great work these organizations will continue to do in the months and years to come,” she added.

Loeffler’s opponent Rev. Warnock, a black theologian, is a controversial figure who has a well-documented history of radical views. Warnock has said that his approval of abortion is “consistent with my view as a Christian minister” and has called for the creation of a “militant church.”

Mike Bloomberg Gun Control Group Descends on Georgia to Back Democrat Ossoff,['Awr Hawkins'],"Democrat Senate candidate Jon Ossoff (GA) is endorsed by the Mike Bloomberg-founded gun control group, Everytown for Gun Safety.

Everytown originally announced its endorsement of Ossoff on September 15, 2020, then re-announced it following the development of a January 5, 2021, runoff between Ossoff and pro-Second Amendment Senator David Perdue (R-GA).

On November 8, 2020, Everytown posted their announcement of support for Ossoff in the runoff, making clear their backing includes the support of Bloomberg gun control subsidiary, Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety.

Everytown’s John Feinblatt said, “David Perdue…[has] declared fealty to the gun lobby and opposed bipartisan gun safety measures like background checks on all gun sales. Everytown’s grassroots army is ready to do the work to send David Perdue…packing.”

Moms Demand’s Shannon Watts said, “We’re ready to send…David Perdue packing because instead of working for Georgians, [he’s] prioritized special interests like the gun lobby, pandered to extremists in their party, and catered to the views of right-wing conspiracy theorists.”

Watts’ criticism of Sen. Perdue’s pro-Second Amendment stance is meant to keep attention way from the whole truth regarding Ossoff’s radical gun control agenda. For example, on November 10, 2020, Breitbart News reported Ossoff wants to ban on all semiautomatic rifles and magazines which the left categorizes a “high capacity.”

2017 Video Shows Democrat Raphael Warnock Believes ‘Racism’ Is ‘America’s Preexisting Condition’,['Ashley Oliver'],"Rev. Raphael Warnock preached in 2017 that “America’s preexisting condition” is “racism” during at least two of the several speeches and sermons Warnock has given that have come under scrutiny for their radical messaging.

Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, said at a New Baptist Covenant event on June 29, 2017, that he “would not be a prophet” if he did not inform his audience “that racism is America’s preexisting condition”:



Warnock said in the clip New Baptist Covenant shared from the event:

We are in a special moment. We are in an evil moment. We are in a tragic moment, and I suggest to you that our politics is symptomatic of our sickness. We’ve got a lot of problems, but I would not be a prophet if I did not tell you that racism is America’s preexisting condition. Like the insurance companies, nobody wants to go there. Nobody wants to cover it because we wonder what it would cost. We, the land of the free, and the incarceration capital of the world. In this land where we warehouse 25 percent of the world’s prisoners although we are only five percent of the world, we are to ask ourselves what has it cost us not to cover it, not to face up to it, not to confront it, not to deal with it. Racism is America’s preexisting condition.

Warnock also preached in a video compilation dubbed “2017Year Ender” that racism, classism, bigotry, and xenophobia comprise America’s “preexisting condition”:

Warnock said, “America has a preexisting condition. It’s called racism. It’s called classism. It’s called bigotry. It’s called xenophobia. And we need God to heal us of our preexisting condition.”

As Warnock pursues unseating Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in Georgia’s highly consequential Senate runoff race on January 5, Warnock’s connection to provocative and racially charged rhetoric has come into the spotlight.

Warnock appeared on Fox News in 2008 and defended Jeremiah Wright, who served as former pastor to President Barack Obama and is known for a number of incendiary statements — which Obama himself has condemned — including declaring that “America’s chickens are coming home to roost” in regard to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and giving an impassioned speech in which he repeatedly shouted “God damn America.”

Warnock said in 2016 just before the presidential election that “America needs to repent for its worship of whiteness on full display.”

Warnock has twice praised Dr. James Cone and described Cone as his “mentor.” Cone claimed to fight racism but employed a wealth of anti-white language, including decrying “satanic whiteness” and calling for the “destruction of everything white” in society.

In addition to comparing racism in America to a preexisting medical condition, Warnock has made a string of anti-police remarks, including that “we shouldn’t be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street” and that “often those who are sworn to protect cause more trouble.”

Warnock responded to criticism of his past comments in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution interview in March this year, saying, “Any fair-thinking person would recognize that everything a government does, even the American government, is not consistent with God’s dream for the world.”

Warnock is running against incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), alongside another Georgia Senate run-off race between Jon Ossoff and incumbent Sen. David Perdue (R-GA).

Republicans have 50 seats in the Senate, and if Democrats win the two Georgia run-off races, they will tie Republicans for control of the U.S. Senate, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) casting the deciding vote should she become vice president.

Democrats hope to gain control of the upper chamber in addition to the House to push through major reforms in a prospective Biden administration. A Republican-controlled Senate would provide a backstop against that.

While Warnock’s campaign claims that he does not want to defund the police, Working Families Party has been clear about its aims.

As recently as September 23, it tweeted: “End white supremacy. Transform this country. Defund the police. Defeat those who stand in the way of a world in which #BlackLivesMatter . #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor.”

The party received $1 million from Soros-funded Democracy PAC this year, according to Politico, and has a charter that calls for shifting “resources away from policing, jails and detention centers, endless wars and agencies that separate families.”

It adds: “Shift resources into schools, housing, healthcare and jobs, to enable all people – especially Black and brown people, immigrants, and Indigenous people – to thrive.”

The charter is signed by all four members of the so-called “Squad” — House Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), and Ayanna Pressley (D-MA).

The group has also called for defunding the Department of Homeland Security, and for protecting Planned Parenthood.

Working Families Party plans to organize text banking for Warnock every Tuesday until the run-off election date on January 5.

"Democrats Aim to Create, Exploit Divisions Among GOP in Georgia",['Matthew Boyle'],"Democrats from outside Georgia are actively engaged in an effort to create divisions among Republicans in the state.

The Democrats then intend to exploit those divisions to try to drive down turnout among President Donald Trump’s supporters in the runoff for the two U.S. Senate seats that will decide which party controls the upper chamber of Congress next year. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing back on these efforts, calling them “deceitful campaign tactics” designed to “manipulate voters” in Georgia.

Really American PAC, a leftwing Super PAC that ran scores of attack ads against President Trump in the general election in 2020, is now crowdfunding on social media to fund billboards in Trump-supporter-heavy areas of Georgia to split Trump supporters from Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA). Both GOP senators are headed to Jan. 5 runoffs in the state that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate next year. As of now, next year Republicans will have 50 seats in the U.S. Senate and Democrats will have 48. These two seats will determine which party controls the Senate, and if the Democrats take both of them—and Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden is successful in challenges from President Donald Trump to election results that currently have Biden leading Trump—then the Democrats would gain control of the chamber as the would-be Vice President Kamala Harris, now a Democrat senator from California, would be the tie-breaking vote.

As Trump is challenging the election results in Georgia and other states around the country, the Democrats are now trying to imply that Loeffler and Perdue have been insufficiently loyal to the president.

The billboards Really American PAC is seeking to post around Georgia explicitly state this in text that appears alongside images of Loeffler and Perdue: “Georgia Republicans Didn’t Fight For Trump. We Won’t Fight For Them.”

This revelation that key figures in the Democrat Party—who stand to benefit politically from a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate if their candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock defeat Perdue and Loeffler respectively—are behind these attempts to create such divisions comes as no surprise to Trump supporters, who are acutely aware that the president’s supporters are firmly behind the GOP candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia in the runoffs.

In particular, as Breitbart News reported earlier on Monday, Donald Trump Jr.—President Trump’s eldest son—put to bed any suggestion that Trump supporters should be thinking about sitting out the runoff elections in Georgia.

I’m seeing a lot of talk from people that are supposed to be on our side telling GOP voters not to go out & vote for @KLoeffler and @PerdueSenate. That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people. We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.#MAGA #GASEN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 23, 2020

In response to the Breitbart News article, some of those on the right who had been hyping these concerns about Republicans sitting out the election—like activist Ali Alexander, who’s been behind many of the #StopTheSteal rallies around the country—assured followers there is no division and Trump supporters will rally behind Loeffler and Perdue.

Trump Jr. Urges Georgians to Back Loeffler, Perdue in Senate Runoffs We will all work this out 🇺🇸 https://t.co/rWNDXX7HlF — Ali #StopTheSteal (@ali) November 23, 2020

We will all be on the same page by Jan 5th. Don’t attack Don Jr, Lin, me or anyone rowing in the same general direction. I don’t have time for people cashing in past personal vendettas. If you want to boost GOP Turnout take any action to secure our elections NOW! #ProTip ONWARD🇺🇸 — Ali #StopTheSteal (@ali) November 23, 2020

Nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh also suggested on his program on Monday that Trump himself should head to Georgia to rally with the GOP Senators, as Vice President Mike Pence already has since the election. and others in Trump’s orbit have or intend to do soon.

The idea that Loeffler and Perdue have not stood with Trump all the way through this fight is on its face untrue. They both have issued statements in support of the president’s recount push and backed him at every turn—and again, the Trump administration knows this, which is why Pence held two rallies last week with the two senators.

When asked about these billboards from Democrats seeking to divide Republicans, the Georgia Republican Party dismissed them as “deceitful campaign tactics” designed to “manipulate voters.”

“Democrats are desperate to elect Radical Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff so they can implement Schumer and Pelosi’s radical socialist agenda, and unfortunately for Georgians, that includes deceitful campaign tactics to manipulate voters,” Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler told Breitbart News. “But their attempts to divide Republicans are pointless. Georgians know that Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue continue to stand with our President.”

Really American PAC had tweeted the images of the planned billboards and a plea that linked to a fundraising page on ActBlue, the formal Democrat Party fundraising platform. When Breitbart News asked the organization for comment, the group declined—and then the original tweet disappeared.

“We’re crowdfunding billboards in counties that went for Trump in Georgia to let Trump supporters know that the GA Republicans didn’t fight for them, they shouldn’t fight for Loeffler & Perdue,” the tweet read. It encouraged followers to retweet it, and “chip in” to “help get this done.”

As of publication of this article, though, the fundraising plea on ActBlue’s website is still active.

The ActBlue fundraising plea for the Really American PAC billboards goes even further than the tweet does in attempting to create and foment intra-GOP divisions to help the Democrats take the Senate.

The Democrats’ fundraising website reads:

Trump supporters in Georgia are saying that because David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler couldn’t deliver a victory in Georgia for Trump, MAGA supporters should not deliver a victory for them in the run-off election. We agree. That’s why we’re crowdfunding these billboards in the counties in Georgia that voted for Trump in the highest numbers: Georgia Republicans Didn’t Fight For Trump. We Won’t Fight For Them.

The battle in Georgia could determine a lot about the future of the country. If Biden does end up overcoming the election challenges from Trump and remains in the lead, then the GOP having a majority in the Senate would be a check on a Biden administration. If the Democrats did take control of the Senate, they would, even though they would have a very slim majority, control the floor and committees in such a scenario that the people of Georgia could stop if they reelect Sens. Perdue and Loeffler.

It remains to be seen what will happen, but Democrats are already aggressively pursuing these seats, as evidenced by this billboard campaign and by efforts that failed former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is leading to stuff as many absentee ballots into the public sphere as she can ahead of the election. Abrams bragged earlier on Monday about how, according to her claims, more than three quarters of a million such ballot requests had gone out already after the state began sending them out a few days ago.",BreitBart,-1
"Georgia GOP Ad: If Americans Do Not Vote, Illegal Aliens Will",['John Binder'],"A new ad by the Georgia Republican Party is stating that illegal aliens will earn the right to vote if Americans do not vote in the Senate runoff elections where Senators David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) are facing Democrat challengers.

An ad running in the state quotes Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and failed Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams discussing changing the United States amid a “blue wave.”

“Now we take Georgia. Then we change America,” the ad quotes Schumer saying. “When the radicals say, ‘Change America,’ this is what they mean: Opening the border, illegal immigrants voting, total Democrat control.”

When the radicals say “change America,” they mean: opening the border and allowing illegal immigrants voting. Georgia, go vote, because if you don’t, illegal immigrants will. pic.twitter.com/az2pKjnhNr — GAGOP (@GaRepublicans) November 23, 2020

“But the thing of it is, the blue wave … is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented,” Abrams says in the ad.

“Save Georgia. Save America,” the ad continues. “Go vote because if you don’t, illegal immigrants will.”

Abigail Sigler, a spokeswoman for the Georgia GOP called Perdue and Loeffler’s Democrat challengers, Raphael Warnock and Jon Osoff, “radical,” with plans for amnesty to 11 to 22 million illegal aliens.

“Radical Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff have made it clear they would go to Washington to be rubber stamps for Schumer’s extreme radical agenda, which includes giving illegal immigrants the right to vote,” Sigler said in a statement.

“The stakes in the election could not be higher, and Georgians who want to protect the American way of life we treasure must support Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for Senate,” Sigler said.

Should the Georgia Senate seats flip, Democrats would have majorities in the House and Senate with a potential incoming Joe Biden administration. Earlier this year, House Democrats attempted to implement a quasi-amnesty for illegal aliens in the workforce in a coronavirus relief package, along with nationwide ballot harvesting.

Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Maria Bartiromo: She’s ‘Auditioning’ to Become Donald Trump’s Next Wife,['David Ng'],"ABC’s left-wing late night host Jimmy Kimmel took a shot at Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo during his late-night ABC show on Monday, mocking her recent interview with President Donald Trump and joking that she is “auditioning” to become the president’s new wife.

President Trump gave his first post-election interview to Maria Bartiromo on her Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures. During the phone interview, the president attacked the mainstream media for its refusal to run negative stories about Joe Biden, calling it “suppression by the press.”

“We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression by the press. They suppress,” the president said. “You can’t have a scandal if nobody reports about it. This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint.”

Jimmy Kimmel used the Fox News interview to mock Bartiromo, calling her “always sycophantic” when it comes to the president.

“I don’t know what happened to her, but she appears to be auditioning for the position of Donald Trump’s next wife because that was some interview,” he said.

Watch below:

Speaking of sycophantic, Kimmel recently interviewed former President Barack Obama, gushing over the former commander in chief by asking a series of softball questions to promote Obama’s new memoirs, A Promised Land.

During Monday’s show, Kimmel also mocked the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, saying that he has always hated the annual holiday tradition “I hate parades. To me, it’s just traffic with balloons.”

David Mamet Calls Out ‘Experts’ and Questions Lockdowns: ‘The Virus Here Is Government’,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called “experts” and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

“The virus here is government—or at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,” Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence—and they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ — WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

“We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.”

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. “One is ‘permitted’ to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?”

David Mamet compares today’s coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. “Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,” he added. “The news media, backed by those parts of the ‘scientific community’ the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.”

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

“A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.”

BBC Studios Imposes 20 Percent Diversity Quota on All New Productions,['David Ng'],"BBC Studios, the largest producer of content in Great Britain, is imposing a 20 percent diversity quota on all new productions in an apparent effort to boost the visibility of ethnic minorities, LGBTQ individuals, and people with disabilities.

The studio announced the quotas on Monday, saying in a press release that the new “inclusion rider” is effective immediately and will apply to on-screen talent and well as behind-the-scenes staff on all new BBC and third-party U.K. commissions. The rider targets so-called “BAME” individuals — black, Asian, minority ethnic people, as well as the disabled and low-income individuals.

“These initiatives are by no means a magic bullet and we’re also doing a lot of work on culture and education to make our teams more inclusive,” Ralph Lee, BBC Studios’ director of content, said in a statement. “The talent in front of and behind the camera will give perspectives that will shape our content, making it more authentic and universal in its depiction of our audiences — and ultimately its appeal with them.”

BBC Studios said that LGBTQ talent won’t be eligible for off-screen quotas because the company “has already exceeded this target.”

Among the most popular shows from BBC Studios are Top Gear, Doctor Who, Good Omens, Luther, and the long-running EastEnders. The studio, which is the production arm of the BBC, also creates content for distributors around the world, including Amazon, Apple, and China Mobile.

The initiative is the latest move by the entertainment industry to impose diversity quotas on movies and TV shows. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September that movies must reach certain quotas for women, ethnic minorities, disabled, and LGBTQ people if they are to be considered for the best picture Oscars category.

Felicity Huffman Lands Lead in ABC Comedy Following Prison Sentence in College Admissions Bribery Scandal,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Felicity Huffman is plotting her acting comeback, landing a lead role in an ABC baseball comedy. The role marks Huffman’s first major acting gig after she pled guilty to fraud stemming from her involvement in the 2019 college admissions scandal.

The comedy, according to a report by Deadline, will star Huffman as Susan Savage, the real-life owner of the minor-league baseball team The Sacramento River Cats. Savage inherited the Triple-A baseball team after her husband passed away.

Felicity Huffman will also executive produce the comedy alongside her co-star actor Zack Gottsagen.

“After suddenly losing her husband and inheriting his beloved team, she is forced to navigate her new normal with the help of her dysfunctional family, including her oldest son (Gottsagen), a baseball devotee with Down syndrome, her work family and the Sacramento community at large,” reports Deadline. “This is the story of a woman navigating grief, local politics and the business of sports and learning not just to adjust, but to thrive.

Last year, the Desperate Housewives actress pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. In addition to two weeks in jail, Huffman was also sentenced to a year of supervised release and was ordered to perform 250 hours of community service.

"Barbra Streisand Gushes: Biden Will ‘Bring Back Dignity, Honesty, Intelligence, and Compassion’",['David Ng'],"Barbra Streisand is “exhilarated” about the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president, saying that Biden will “bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office.”

The Oscar-winning Hollywood leftist also bashed President Donald Trump in an interview with the New York Times, calling him a liar and blaming him for the loss of “thousands of lives.” The accusation is one that Streisand has repeatedly made on social media, having previously claimed that President Trump’s “incompetence and lies” are responsible for thousands of coronavirus fatalities.

In her talk with the Time’s T style magazine, Barbra Streisand expressed her thrill at the possibility of Joe Biden, who recently broke his foot, taking office. “I’m exhilarated … [He] will bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office. I look forward to that.”

Neither Streisand nor the Times reporter brought up the Hunter Biden scandal or Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegations against the presidential hopeful.The singer-actress was a major supporter of Biden’s campaign, participating in several Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic candidate.

“What do I hate most about Trump? He lies every day,” she told the Times. “He has the compulsion to lie, even when the facts say something different. The worst lie was about the pandemic. Why not face facts? Why not tell the truth? People are stronger than you think — they can handle the truth. It would have saved thousands of lives.”

Streisand didn’t clarify her allegation claiming that the president has lied about the pandemic. She also omitted the fact the President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, which fast-tracked a public-private partnership with drug makers to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The project has yielded vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that are expected to start reaching the public in December.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added her praise for Streisand to the article, lauding the Hollywood celebrity for her political activism that started before it became fashionable.

“It took real courage back then to get involved because the entertainment industry believed there’d be a backlash,” Pelosi told the Times. Streisand in fundraising mode “is dazzling to behold,” Pelosi added. “It’s not just because she’s a celebrity. She knows the issues. She’s studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That’s what’s persuasive.”

Pelosi continued: “She doesn’t have to do this… She does it out of patriotism. She loves our country.”

Streisand also told the Times that she reached out to the daughter of George Floyd shortly after he died while in Minneapolis policy custody, setting off race riots around the country.

Streisand said she sent six-year-old Gianna some shares of Disney stock, along with a letter in which she recounted how she also lost her father at a young age.

“I think our dads watch over us forever,” Streisand wrote, according to the Times. “When you get older and have a decision to make … just close your eyes and ask him for help. And if you listen very carefully, he will lead you to the right choice. I promise!”

Among the most popular shows from BBC Studios are Top Gear, Doctor Who, Good Omens, Luther, and the long-running EastEnders. The studio, which is the production arm of the BBC, also creates content for distributors around the world, including Amazon, Apple, and China Mobile.

The initiative is the latest move by the entertainment industry to impose diversity quotas on movies and TV shows. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September that movies must reach certain quotas for women, ethnic minorities, disabled, and LGBTQ people if they are to be considered for the best picture Oscars category.

Nolte: Coronavirus Speeds Up the Napster-ization of Movies,['John Nolte'],"Back in 1999, Napster killed the music business forever. And now what happened to music 20 years ago is happening to the movie business — and that is a critical piece of analysis missing from this piece from the far-left New York Times looking at the demise of films.

Napster annihilated the music business when it took music digital and got everyone used to not paying much of anything for music. Who’s going to pay for music after you’re used to not paying for it?

Worse though, Napster cheapened music. Not to go all In my day on everyone, but there’s a reason why the biggest music names touring the past few years are almost all aged 80 to 40. Elton John, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones, KISS, Cher, Garth Brooks, Bob Seger, Phil Collins, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Pink, Eminem, Journey, Def Leppard, U2, Sting, Backstreet Boys, Scorpions, Rod Stewart, Celine Dion, Guns n’ Roses, Justin Timberlake. Sure, Ariana Grande is on the list. I’m sure a Beyonce or Taylor Swift can fill a venue, but this is like growing up in the 80s and 90s and the biggest grossing tours are Bill Haley and the Comets, the Platters, the Four Seasons, Paul Anka, and Frankie Avalon.

In my day — sorry to do that to you again — new music was a big deal. You didn’t hit a button on your Spotify account to listen to it. You saved your money. You went out and bought the album. You recorded the album on cassette so you wouldn’t wear out the vinyl and could listen to it in your car. You put on headphones. Laid down on the bed. Listened to both sides, and when you flipped it over you were careful not to touch anything but the edges, and then you stared at the album cover the whole time — read the liner notes. Then your friends came over. You listened to it again and again, talked about it, and waited to see what the first top 40 single would be.

There’s none of that now. Music is just a commodity today, a product, and oftentimes a product used to sell another product. You listen, you move on. The specialness is gone. The sense that a new release is meaningful is gone. Worse still, the sense the art itself is meaningful, that it speaks to you in some way, is gone. It’s all just disposable junk now. That, by the way, is not my commentary on the quality of today’s music, but how people perceive music today.

Music is now just something else on the Internet, like a YouTube video or tweet or blog post. What used to fill a meaningful gap in people’s lives now just fills four minutes of their time.

This is what’s going to happen to movies, and what has been happening to movies for a long while now…

And when I talk about movies, I’m talking about movie-movies, not TV movies.

I really enjoyed Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, but it was a made-for-TV movie (Netflix) and is therefore a TV movie– a point I’ll circle back to in a bit. But let’s first look at how Hollywood had already cheapened the art, even before the coronavirus hit…

When movies were still around what were they? It was all CGI and spectacle and a big roller coaster ride. Except for cheapie horror, movies had become one big and bloated $400 million gamble after another, and with Marvel having run its course with the Avengers, and Disney running out of cartoons to bring to real (CGI) life and the DC brand running more cold than hot, and the Fast and Furious crew about to qualify for AARP, the movie business was already about to hit a wall and was already becoming something hollow and forgettable.

Sure, some of these movies are a good time, but so is reading Twitter and watching YouTube.

Art is more than a good time. It stays with you, affects you, maybe even changes you; it inspires you, makes you think, makes you want to re-experience it thinking you might have missed a deeper meaning that first time. Yeah, sure, there are exceptions that tell a human story, a Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or Ford v. Ferrari, but those are exceptions. Rare exceptions.

I just wonder, now that the coronavirus has shut the movie business down, are people really missing it?

And now that the coronavirus is forcing blockbuster movies like Soul and Wonder Woman 1984 and Coming to America 2 and Mulan and a whole bunch of others to go direct to streaming, that means the movies are one step closer to Napster-izing themselves. All these movies are going to go the route of The Irishman — cheapened and lost in the literal bottomless black hole that is Netflix’s (or whoever’s) endless selection.

We watch the Irishman and Hillbilly Elegy and countless others just like them as though they are commodities, time fillers, and with streaming blowing up like it has, with it becoming a primary source of income for the studios, we’re going to see a whole lot more movies cheapened in the same way — most of them, in fact.

And no, it’s not like when a movie would premier on TV before there was home video, which used to be a big deal, an event. Or when a movie premiered on home video, which was also something to get excited over. Because those movies had been in theaters, so they came with that imprimatur, and that imprimatur meant something. And they were more than just a video game or roller coaster ride brought to life.

Now, no matter how good or great it is, countless movies (and more are coming) are dumped in the massive universe of the streaming carousel, just another digital product, just another tweet, just another YouTube video to fill your day.

Music used to be special. Now it’s not.

Movies used to be special, and now they are less so every day.

Nolte: Coronavirus Catastrophe at Thanksgiving Box Office,['John Nolte'],"The Croods: New Age, the top movie over the Thanksgiving weekend, grossed a terrible $14.2 million. That was over the five-day weekend — meaning Wednesday through Sunday. Over three days (Friday- Sunday), it grossed just $9.7 million.

A good faith look at the top ten movies over Thanksgiving weekend finds that they did not top $20 million total. What I mean is that all ten movies did not bring in more than $20 million together. Three of the movies in the top ten are old enough to drive: Elf (2003), The Santa Clause (1994), and Christmas Vacation (1989).

What’s interesting, though, is that Croods: New Age bottomed out with just $14.2 million over five days, even though it was released in 2,211 theaters. That’s a lot of theaters. Granted, that’s about half the number of theaters it would have been released into in pre-coronavirus America but that’s still a sizable number of theaters, enough theaters — even with social distancing, to gross a respectable amount, which tells me that even though theaters are open near them, people are still not going to the movies.

For example, last Thanksgiving, Frozen II was playing on 4,440 screens and grossed $34.1 million on Thanksgiving Day alone. Just on that one day. Over that five day weekend, it cleared $110 million on only twice as many screens as the Croods. I should also point out that was Frozen II’s second weekend, not its opening weekend.

So the number of screens is not the problem in the age of the coronavirus. The problem is that people aren’t going to the movies even where they can go to the movies.

The horror film Freaky, in its third week of release, grossed just $1.1 million in 1,735 theaters. Over the course of its run, it’s grossed just $7 million, so social distancing or not, it is playing to very, very empty houses.

Keep in mind that movie theaters are only open in areas where the government is telling people it is safe to go to the movies, where movies theaters are practicing social distancing. Nevertheless, people still aren’t going.

People who can go to the movies are not going to the movies.

No wonder Hollywood is worried.

Ted Cruz Hammers Alyssa Milano On Coronavirus Aid: ‘Every Senate Dem Voted to Block Relief’,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R, TX) called out leftist actress Alyssa Milano for her attack on Republican lawmakers blocking a recent coronavirus relief bill after she ignored months of Democrats blocking similar financial relief bills.

Alyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday to slap congressional Republicans for blocking a minimum wage hike and a coronavirus relief bill for working-class families. Milano posted her tweet as a reply to an earlier tweet by Sen. Cruz, in which he noted the statistics proving that the Democrats are now the party of the super-rich, coastal elites while the GOP has become the party of working class Americans.

This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 29, 2020

The Charmed star questioned Cruz’ contention that the GOP is now the party of the working classes by noting that the GOP had blocked the coronavirus bill. “This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down,” Milnao tweeted on Sunday.

It is not exactly clear what bills Milano was speaking about but it is possible she was referring to the latest $15 Minimum Wage increase that died in the Senate. And she could be referring to Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s decision back in October to ignore Democrat Chuck Schumer’s attempt to force the upper chamber to discuss a second $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

Schumer wanted to debate his relief bill when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was being confirmed. It would have restored the $600-per-week federal unemployment boost and would have sent another $1,200 stimulus check to Americans.

But Senator Cruz quickly pushed back. The Texas Senator noted that Milano conveniently ignored the many months that Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate blocked the GOP’s $500 billion coronavirus aid bill.

“Alyssa, facts matter,” Cruz tweeted back to Milano. “Dems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief. EVERY SINGLE Senate Dem voted to block relief—Pelosi refuses even to talk—bc they believe maximizing economic pain helped Biden & it helps Dems in GA. & they trust the press to cover for them.”

"Joy Behar: If Hillary Clinton Won, U.S. Would Not Be Number One in Coronavirus Cases, Deaths",['Pam Key'],"Co-host Joy Behar said on Monday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View” that if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election, the United States would not be “number one in the world in COVID cases and COVID deaths.”

During a discussion on Joe Biden’s all-female communication team picks, Behar said, “I think Joe Biden is now demonstrating correctly that women can run things really well, and we’re all going to be a witness to it. He’s got Kamala Harris in the second position, you know, that’s the first time we’ve seen that. Let the world see how well women can do when put in the spot when they can do the job.”

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, “Joy, to your point, we know that women leaders have done really well when it comes to the pandemic response, right? Think about Australia and New Zealand. They’re proven to be effective leaders time and time again. If you look at any study, and I mean Harvard has a tremendous amount of data on this, women have in comparison to men, I hate to say it, but it’s true, have more leadership skills when given the opportunity. Unfortunately, oftentimes we’re not.”

Behar said, “Don’t we all believe at this point — I know I do, if Hillary Clinton were president instead of Trump for the last four years, we would not have — we would not be number one in the world in COVID cases and COVID deaths.”

She continued, “I just believe that. I don’t think Hillary would have lied to the American people. She would have been interviewed by Bob Woodward, and she would have said, this is a terrible thing, and we have to clamp down on it right away. I know she would have done that.”

"Barbra Streisand Gushes: Biden Will ‘Bring Back Dignity, Honesty, Intelligence, and Compassion’",['David Ng'],"Barbra Streisand is “exhilarated” about the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president, saying that Biden will “bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office.”

The Oscar-winning Hollywood leftist also bashed President Donald Trump in an interview with the New York Times, calling him a liar and blaming him for the loss of “thousands of lives.” The accusation is one that Streisand has repeatedly made on social media, having previously claimed that President Trump’s “incompetence and lies” are responsible for thousands of coronavirus fatalities.

In her talk with the Time’s T style magazine, Barbra Streisand expressed her thrill at the possibility of Joe Biden, who recently broke his foot, taking office. “I’m exhilarated … [He] will bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office. I look forward to that.”

Neither Streisand nor the Times reporter brought up the Hunter Biden scandal or Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegations against the presidential hopeful.The singer-actress was a major supporter of Biden’s campaign, participating in several Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic candidate.

“What do I hate most about Trump? He lies every day,” she told the Times. “He has the compulsion to lie, even when the facts say something different. The worst lie was about the pandemic. Why not face facts? Why not tell the truth? People are stronger than you think — they can handle the truth. It would have saved thousands of lives.”

Streisand didn’t clarify her allegation claiming that the president has lied about the pandemic. She also omitted the fact the President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, which fast-tracked a public-private partnership with drug makers to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The project has yielded vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that are expected to start reaching the public in December.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added her praise for Streisand to the article, lauding the Hollywood celebrity for her political activism that started before it became fashionable.

“It took real courage back then to get involved because the entertainment industry believed there’d be a backlash,” Pelosi told the Times. Streisand in fundraising mode “is dazzling to behold,” Pelosi added. “It’s not just because she’s a celebrity. She knows the issues. She’s studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That’s what’s persuasive.”

Pelosi continued: “She doesn’t have to do this… She does it out of patriotism. She loves our country.”

Streisand also told the Times that she reached out to the daughter of George Floyd shortly after he died while in Minneapolis policy custody, setting off race riots around the country.

Streisand said she sent six-year-old Gianna some shares of Disney stock, along with a letter in which she recounted how she also lost her father at a young age.

“I think our dads watch over us forever,” Streisand wrote, according to the Times. “When you get older and have a decision to make … just close your eyes and ask him for help. And if you listen very carefully, he will lead you to the right choice. I promise!”

ABC’s Hostin: Trump ‘Is in a Psychosis’ — Needs ‘to Go to Losers Anonymous’,['Pam Key'],"Co-host and network legal analyst Sunny Hostin said on Monday’s broadcast of ABC’s “The View” that President Donald Trump is “really in a psychosis right now” in how he is reacting to the 2020 election.

Whoopi Goldberg said, “Yesterday you-know-who gave his first post-election loss interview to Maria Bartiromo where he continued his claims of a rigged election and even threw his own intelligence agencies under the bus. Now take a look.”

In a Fox News clip, Trump said, “There’s no way Joe Biden beat Barack Obama in the black communities of various cities, and then he did very badly compared to Obama in other cities throughout the United States. There’s no way it happened. This election was a fraud. It was a rigged election.”

Hostin said, “I mean, some of the claims he made in the interview yesterday were so outrageous. It’s, you know, especially when he talked about black voters, Whoopi. It just seems to me that he is surprised that all the attempts at voter suppression, all the attempts at gerrymandering, all the attempts at screwing around with the U.S. Postal Service, those attempts were ineffective, and our, you know, our institutions held. I think that is what is surprising this president and his supporters because we know that that’s what was at play, especially in a place like Georgia. That was certainly at play in Michigan and Detroit. They really attacked black constituents, black voters. That was the plan, and it just didn’t work. Probably because of people like LaTosha Brown and Stacey Abrams, right? I think that’s where the surprise is coming from.”

She continued, “What’s also fascinating, he just needs to go to losers anonymous, and he is really in a psychosis right now. I’m surprised that the people around him like his daughter, like Jared Kushner, who somehow is on his way to the Middle East. I don’t understand why he has to go to the Middle East today or this week. I think they need to stage some sort of intervention at this point because he is now damaging the Republican Party even further with all of this rhetoric.”

Music Festivals Offer to Put on Mass Vaccinations in Belgium,['Breitbart London'],"BRUSSELS (AP) – With nothing on their agendas for months to come, music festival organizers in Belgium want to use their know-how to help the country’s coronavirus vaccination campaign.

The Belgian government has set a goal of vaccinating about 70% of the country’s population, about 8 million people, when approved COVID-19 vaccination shots become available.

As the vaccines are expected to arrive in multi-dose vials for shots to be administered all on the same day, Belgium health authorities are planning to vaccinate people in groups as much as possible. The task will pose many logistical challenges, including the creation of vaccination centers that festival organizers say they can help set up.

Enjoying a strong reputation in the music world, Belgian festival experts have proven experience in both building huge pop-up structures and in crowd management.

With the music industry hit hard by the pandemic’s economic, several festivals in the French-speaking region of Wallonia and the Brussels area have created a federation to better defend their interests. They have a large network of technicians who are currently unemployed and are ready to help out.

“Our sector has been at a standstill for many months, and our many staff are eager to bring their creativity and dedication to the fight against coronavirus,” said federation president Damien Dufrasne.

One of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, Belgium has reported some 577,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,500 deaths linked to the virus.

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said COVID-19 vaccinations could start in the European Union’s 27 nations before the end of December. The commission, the EU´s executive arm, has agreements with six potential vaccine suppliers and is working on a seventh contract. The deals allow it to purchase over 1.2 billion doses, more than double the population of the EU.

Delingpole: Laurence Fox Has Lunch with Friends. Quick! Fine Him!,['James Delingpole'],"Actor turned political activist Laurence Fox is in trouble again.

He enjoyed a lunch with friends, gave them hugs, then boasted about it on Twitter.

Here is the shocking proof:

Just had a large group over to lunch and we hugged and ate and talked and put the world to rights. It was lovely. You’ll never take that away from people. Stay out. Protect your rights. If the @nhs can’t cope, then the @nhs isn’t fit for purpose. Compliance is violence. — Laurence Fox (@LozzaFox) November 29, 2020

In a decade or so’s time, when historians look back on the madness of 2020, they are going to examine tweets like this in a state of utter disbelief.

“Can it really be that in 2020 the very act of having lunch with a bunch of people, talking to them and hugging them was considered to be something dangerously reactionary and irresponsible?” they’ll ask.

And for confirmation, they’ll only have to look at some of the responses.

Here’s a snitch called Darryl — one of several — who wants to report Fox to the police and land him a £10,000 fine.

@metpoliceuk Hello. I’d like to report a breach of the lockdown guidelines. Please ensure Mr Fox gets his £10,000 fine. — DarryI (@DarrylInnes) November 29, 2020

And here are a few more examples of the furious comments Fox received.

Get fucked, you desperate, deranged, narcissistic gusset stain. I hope your sprouts get overcooked to mush and that the copy of The Wicker Man you put on your Christmas list turns out to be the Nicolas Cage remake. Dear oh dear, I can’t quite believe the sheer nerve of this. I am an actor, currently working within the NHS on a Covid contract to keep the wolf from the door until our industry recovers. Just can’t quite believe the brazen lack of respect for what is right. And when one of that group falls ill and they and their family suffers as have people I have known, remember your freedom. Lets hope it’s not when you are on a ventilator. Exceptionalism is not a vaccine Laurence. I know people who’ve died, people I loved. I’m currently Covid positive, it’s real, it’s awful. Messages like this, some people will listen and relax their guard. You could kill people. One of the people you hugged, you could have killed them. It’s bleak, but true. THINK. Wasn’t going to get involved with the Laurence Fox stuff, but now he’s bragging about putting my family at risk, I figure why not. I was once up against him for a US TV role – to play the son of James Fox’s character. As in, Laurence’s actual dad. I got it.

There are many more in this vein. What they reveal, I fear, is that Britain is even more bitterly divided than ever it was during Brexit: between those who believe that Covid-19 is a deadly threat which could easily kill off their nearest and dearest and those, like Fox, who believe that it has been horribly overblown by government propaganda and that the time has come for us all to get on with our lives, reclaim our freedoms and get the economy back up and running.

The two positions are so intractably opposed that it’s hard to see how they can easily be resolved, especially when there’s so much righteous indignation on both sides.

But let’s take a step back for a moment. In what kind of sane universe would it be possible for a man to attract so much rage, so much bitter hatred merely for the crime of enjoying a lunch with friends.

Before 2020 it would have been literally inconceivable that anyone could consider the act of having lunch with friends anything but a healthy, happy, and perhaps above all, unexceptionable activity. It wouldn’t have been a problem at the height of either of the two World Wars. It wouldn’t even have been considered a problem during the Bubonic Plague.

I’d say all those angry hotheads bloviating against Laurence Fox need to look in the mirror and ask themselves: “What have I become?”

And Boris Johnson’s administration needs to look at itself too and ask: “What kind of monster have I created?”",BreitBart,-1
Actor Laverne Cox Claims to Be Victim of Transphobic Attack in L.A.,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Transgender actor Laverne Cox detailed an attack in which the Orange Is the New Black star’s friend was apparently beaten by a man who “very aggressively asked for the time” in Los Angeles.

“The guy was hitting my friend,” said Cox, who explained in a ten-minute Instagram video what had allegedly happened while the actor and a friend went for a walk in Griffith Park. “We passed this guy, and the guy very aggressively asked for the time,” said Cox, describing the lead-up to the fight between the stranger and the actor’s friend.

“The friend that I’m with looks at his watch and tells him the time, and then the guy who asked for the time says to my friend, ‘Guy or girl?'” said Cox. “My friend says, ‘Fuck off.'”

After that brief exchange, Cox’s friend and the stranger proceed to fight, according to Cox.

“All of the sudden, the guy is attacking my friend, and I look back — and the guy is, like, hitting my friend, and then my friend is, like, going towards him, and I’m, like, ‘holy shit,’ and I pull out my phone, and I call 911 — to dial 911, and all of the sudden it’s over,” said Cox. “And the guy is gone, and so I put my phone away, and then I’m like, what just happened? It just happened really quickly.”

“It’s not safe in the world,” Cox affirmed. “And I don’t like to think about that a lot, but it’s the truth. It’s the truth and it’s not safe if you’re a trans person. Obviously, I know this well. It’s just really sad.”

“What my friend thinks is that the guy really wanted me to answer so he could, like, you know, spook whether, like, you know, I’m trans or not,” said Cox. “Definitely in shock, definitely triggered,” said Cox, who added that this type of incident has “happened a lot.”

“I mean, it doesn’t always come to blows,” the actor elaborated. “It doesn’t always get physical, but yeah — I’ve had a long history of street harassment in New York, sort of being clocked or spooked, and, you know, sort of called out on the street or whatever. And I just can’t believe that, like, it got physical. I guess I can believe it.”

The Charlie’s Angels actor hadn’t been leaving the house in general due to the coronavirus pandemic, and said “I’m gonna stay inside now, I’m really not going to go out now. Living in fear is, like, not a good thing. It doesn’t matter who you are, you can be, like, Laverne Cox — if you’re trans, you’re gonna experience stuff like this.”

Cox concluded the 10-minute video by stating that it’s important to remember “it’s not your fault” if other people attack you because they don’t want you to “exist in the world” due to being transgender.

“I think it’s important for me to remind myself, and remind you that when these things happen, it’s not your fault,” said Cox. “It’s not your fault that there are people who are not cool with you existing in the world.”

Cox’s received support from many celebrities who commented on the video.

Actress Jamie Chung was among the celebrities who commented, writing: “I’m sorry you and your friend were attacked. This is infuriating. I hope he was reported and you gave them his description.”

Cox did not specify whether or not 911 was called and if there was a police report filed.

London: Pop Star Rita Ora Hit with Fines for Lavish Birthday Party,['Ben Kew'],"British pop star Rita Ora has admitted to a “serious error of judgement” after she was busted for hosting a lavish 30th birthday party for herself at her restaurant in London.

According to the Daily Mail, the “Hot Right Now” singer invited at least seven friends to the bash at the Casa Cruz restaurant in Notting Hill where they partied “until the early hours” of Sunday morning.

After being alerted to the possible infringement of Britain’s nationwide lockdown measures, the London Metropolitan Police attempted to gain access to the venue at around 9pm on Saturday evening, but with no success.

However, officers continued their investigation into whether an event was taking place, and reportedly slapped Ora with a £10,000 fine for her flouting of the lockdown rules. Ora has since acknowledged her mistake, describing it as a “serious and inexcusable error of judgement.”

“Hello all, I attended a small gathering with some friends to celebrate my 30th birthday,” she posted on her Instagram story as reports began to hit the media. “It was a spur of the moment decision made with the misguided view that we were coming out of lockdown and this would be OK. I’m deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk.”

“This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement,” she added. “Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility.”

A source close to Ora told the Mail: “Rita knows her actions were wrong which is why she has voluntarily paid the £10,000 ($13,367 USD) fine to the council. She hopes this will go some way to making up for her error of judgement.”

Ora’s ignoring of the rules follows countless reports of celebrities and public officials urging the public to abide by lockdown measures imposed as a response to the Chinese coronavirus before being caught violating the rules themselves.

Earlier this month, the cast and crew of the upcoming Matrix 4 film reportedly skirted Germany’s ban on parties and large social gatherings by throwing a party scene within the movie.

According to the newspaper Dild, the some 200 actors and production crew attending the bash at the Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Berlin, enjoyed everything from a DJ and pyrotechnics to tattoo stations and food caravans handing out sushi and fancy desserts.

In August, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo allowed musicians and celebrities to skirt the state’s mandatory 14-day quarantine rules so that they could perform at the MTV Video Music Awards.

Says ‘The Crown’ Viewers Should Be Warned Netflix Show Is Fiction, Not Fact",['Simon Kent'],"The UK culture secretary wants the creators behind the TV series ‘The Crown,’ based on the lives of the Royal Family, to include a warning for viewers up front indicating the show is fiction and not a factual documentary.

“I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact,” Oliver Dowden told the Mail on Sunday.

“Without this, I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact.”

Dowden is expected to write to Netflix this week to express his view. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to a report by The Associated Press.

The fourth series of the drama, which stars Olivia Colman as the Queen, has attracted criticism from some quarters for its depiction of royal events, in particular the breakdown of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales.

The Mail on Sunday has led calls for a disclaimer to be added to the series lest people think they are watching a documentary rather than an interpretative piece of fiction.

Report: NHS Will Use 'Sensible' Celebrities to Front Vaccines Campaign,['Jack Montgomery'],"Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) will launch a campaign fronted by “very sensible” celebrities to persuade people to take coronavirus vaccines, according to reports.

“There will be a big national campaign [to drive take-up],” a source told the Guardian.

“NHS England are looking for famous faces, people who are known and loved. It could be celebrities who are very sensible and have done sensible stuff during the pandemic.”

The left-wing newspaper says Marcus Rashford, a professional football player who has been harrying the government over issues such as free school meals in recent months, is one of the names being considered.

100 million doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine have been ordered by Boris Johnson’s government, along with several million American-made vaccines

The Guardian reports that the NHS is seeking to recruit “airline cabin crew, firefighters and the jobless” by the “tens of thousands” to administer vaccines via a Kitchener-style ‘Your NHS needs you’ recruitment drive.

“It will be vital that there are clear culturally-tailored communications delivered by trusted local and community leaders, and targeted at the most vulnerable and harder-to-reach communities, and that it is made easy for these populations to access vaccination,” remarked Dr Penelope Toff, who co-chairs the public health medicine committee of the British Medical Association (BMA).

There is concern in some quarters that black and minority ethnic (BAME) people, who are being infected by the Chinese virus at a disproportionate rate, may be particularly reluctant to be vaccinated, with the chief executive of St George’s hospital trust in London, Jacqueline Totterdell, saying she thinks that “there is a lot of anxiety [among staff], and some of the polls we’ve done around south-west London show that as little as 50 per cent of people are willing just to have it without any [assurance about its safety].”

“We might all think people might be rushing to have it, but actually we might find that’s not quite the case,” she added.

"Celebrity-Backed Time’s Up Spent Big on Executive Salaries, Little on Victims of Sexual Harassment",['David Ng'],"Time’s Up, the anti-sexual harassment organization created by Hollywood celebrities in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, has spent big bucks on executive salaries but has skimped on helping actual victims, according to a new report.

The group raised an impressive $3,670,219 during its founding year of 2018, but spent $1,407,032 on salaries and just $312,001 on the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual harassment, the New York Post reported, citing tax filings.

In addition, the group reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on advertising, and $940,328 on “legal” costs, with the bulk of that figure going to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, the multinational law firm.

Time’s Up boasts a slew of Hollywood celebrities and former Obama associates in leadership roles. The group’s governing board includes former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, mega TV producer Shonda Rhimes, CNN personality Ana Navarro, as well as actresses Eva Longoria and Ashley Judd.

Tina Tchen, who served as an assistant to former President Obama and chief of staff for Michelle Obama, is currently Time’s Up president and chief executive officer. She is also co-founder of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund.

The Time’s Up Foundation’s “global leadership board” includes a bevy of celebrities including Jessica Chastain, Brie Larson, Amy Schumer, Reese Witherspoon, Alyssa Milano, Julianne Moore, Mira Sorvino, and Padma Lakshmi. Oprah Winfrey serves as a “visionary ambassador” for the group.

The Post reported that Time’s Up spent $58,395 on travel and $112,435 on Rally, a public relations firm, during 2018. Charity watchdog groups recommend that non-profits spend 75 percent of their revenue on their mission and 25 percent on administration. Time’s Up spent 38 percent on salaries alone, according to the Post.

Last year, Time’s Up experienced a leadership shake-up after sexual harassment allegations were made against the son of then-president Lisa Borders. Tina Tchen succeeded Borders as the head of the group.

"David Prowse, British Weightlifter Who Played Darth Vader, Passes Away",['Breitbart London'],"LONDON (AP) – Dave Prowse, the British weightlifter-turned-actor who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died. He was 85.

Prowse died Saturday after a short illness, his agent Thomas Bowington said Sunday.

Born in Bristol, southwest England, in 1935, Prowse represented England in weightlifting at the Commonwealth Games in the 1950s before breaking into movies with roles that emphasized his commanding size, including Frankenstein’s monster in a pair of horror films.

Director George Lucas saw Prowse in a small part in “A Clockwork Orange” and asked the 6-foot-6-inch (2-metre) actor to audition for the villainous Vader or the Wookie Chewbacca in Star Wars.

Prowse later told the BBC he chose Darth Vader because “you always remember the bad guys.”

Physically, Prowse was perfect for the part. His lilting English West Country accent was considered less ideal, and his lines were dubbed by James Earl Jones.

Prowse was also known to a generation of British children as the Green Cross Code Man, a superhero in a series of road safety advertisements

Ant-Man director Edgar Wright paid tribute to Prowse on Twitter.

“As a kid Dave Prowse couldn’t be more famous to me; stalking along corridors as evil incarnate in the part of Darth Vader & stopping a whole generation of kiddies from being mown down in street as the Green Cross Code man,” he wrote. “Rest in Peace, Bristol’s finest.”",BreitBart,-1
Jon Voight Warns ‘We Are in Great Danger if We Fall Under a Biden Administration’,['David Ng'],"Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight is warning that the United States will be “in great danger” if Joe Biden becomes president, adding that the left is trying to steal the election with fraudulent votes.

The Midnight Cowboy star also slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) for shutting down the state again. “Gov. Newsom is taking away our freedom, your freedom. He’s a disgrace to mankind.”

Jon Voight made the comments in his most recent video that he posted to Twitter this week: “We’re heading down a street that has no name now. We must not allow our nation to crumble. This is what they want, to destroy America. Let me warn you all that we are in great danger if we fall under a Biden administration.”

Watch below:

Voight, who lives in California, then launched a broadside against Gov. Newsom.

“Our state California is being ruled by a leftist mob — himself, Gov. Newsom is taking away our freedom, your freedom. He’s a disgrace to mankind — he and his relative Nancy Pelosi, who has tried to bring President Trump down,” he said. “Gov. Newsom has destroyed many lives of people who depended on their businesses and now he want to shut down again. He is a lie like all the left that are trying to destroy the USA.”

Voight continued: “I ask all to fight this battle now. To get them all out. I’ve been attacked by my fellow peers, saying I am preaching violence. When the truth is they all are. The left are burning and destroing our cities. We are willing to fight for freedom. Not freedom to burn down our flag, but to raise her up, with the glory of this land of the free. But the left are trying to stop these truths.

“Let us bring justice to the Supreme Court. Let them see how corrupt the left is with their fraudulent votes. Let the truth show itself, that President Trump is the only man that can save this nation. Let us fight this evil now and know that God’s truths will expose them all. Let me ask all to pray in the name of Jesus, Moses, and all saints for their hands of safety to be on us now. The way in which we’re being targeted will be hard to fix. But with all your love and prayers and truths, we can win this battle against this evil force that has taken over this country.”

Voight concluded: “We must get Gov. Newsom out. He is destroying the people’s freedom. We must remember who we are. We are a nation that fought the Civil War and we won that battle. Let’s not give up. God bless.”

In his recent videos, Voight has called Joe Biden “evil” and has expressed support for President Trump’s fight against Biden’s claim to victory in the presidential election.

Actor Faizon Love Sues Universal for Cutting Black Stars Out of ‘Couples Retreat’ Publicity Posters,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Actor Faizon Love is suing Universal Studios for cutting him and his fellow black co-star Kali Hawk out of international publicity posters for the 2009 film, Couples Retreat.

The 52-year-old actor filed a lawsuit on Wednesday stating that he was “aghast” when he saw himself and Hawk removed from publicity posters overseas, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter.

“Universal Studios had no problem featuring Black actors in the comedic film. But when it came to publicizing the film to international audiences, Universal Studios chose to segregate the motion picture’s White and Black actors…” the lawsuit states. “Rather than enjoy maximum visibility with the film’s release, Mr. Love was demoted to the proverbial ‘Invisible Man,’ as penned by Ralph Ellison,” the complaint continued, referring to Ralph Ellison’s civil rights novel.

“Although Couples Retreat achieved a first-place box office opening weekend ranking, and went on a spectacular run that grossed more than $171 million worldwide, Universal Studios placed Mr. Love in the back seat of the ride enjoyed by his six White costars,” the suit added.

Universal Studios had apologized when the doctored poster was first exposed, and according to Love, went on to promise him “lucrative, career-making film roles” in the future, which he says have never materialized.

The lawsuit also accuses Universal of fraud, breach of contract, and violation of California’s fair employment act and civil rights law.

The suit goes on to accuse the film’s lead actor Vince Vaughn of telling Love “that making a big deal about his removal from the poster would not be good for his career.”

Love explained his reasoning for filing the lawsuit more than a decade after the film’s release in a tweet on Thursday.

“People ask why now? One because Universal is still using the edited poster to promote the movie overseas, two no one said any thing when they went back ten years and ask [Kevin Hart] to explain his ‘tweet’ that kept him from hosting the Oscars… not one person said why now…” wrote Love.

The actor was referring to comedian and A-list actor Kevin Hart, who stepped down from hosting the 91st Academy Awards in 2018 amid a backlash over the resurfacing of previous gay jokes and tweets.

Love told Variety that he is seeking redress on behalf of black actors who have been mistreated by the industry.

“They have not only hurt me financially, they have hurt me in a deeper way by dismissing me because of my blackness — and they have hurt all Black performers by continuing to perpetuate racism in the movie industry,” said Love. “I want to ensure that future generations don’t have to endure the racism and whitewashing that I have experienced.

"The Pandemic Is Changing Hollywood, Maybe Forever",['Breitbart News'],"NEW YORK (AP) — “No New ‘Movies’ Till Influenza Ends” blared a New York Times headline on Oct. 10, 1918, while the deadly second wave of the Spanish Flu was unfolding.

A century later, during another pandemic, movies — quotes no longer necessary — are again facing a critical juncture. But it’s not because new films haven’t been coming out. By streaming service, video-on-demand, virtual theater or actual theater, a steady diet of films have been released under COVID-19 every week. The Times has reviewed more than 460 new movies since mid-March.

Watch below:

Yet until recently — with only a few exceptions — those haven’t been the big-budget spectacles Hollywood runs on. Eight months into the pandemic, that’s changing. Last month, the Walt Disney Co. experimented with the $200 million “Mulan” as a premium buy on its fast-growing streaming service, Disney+ — where the Pixar film “Soul” will also go on Dec. 25. WarnerMedia last week announced that “Wonder Woman 1984” — a movie that might have made $1 billion at the box office in a normal summer — will land in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously next month.

Much remains uncertain about how the movie business will survive the pandemic. But it’s increasingly clear that Hollywood won’t be the same afterward. Just as the Spanish Flu, which weeded out smaller companies and contributed to the formation of the studio system, COVID-19 is remaking Hollywood, accelerating a digital makeover and potentially reordering an industry that was already in flux.

“I don’t think the genie will ever be back in the bottle,” says veteran producer Peter Guber, president of Mandalay Entertainment and former chief of Sony Pictures. “It will be a new studio system. Instead of MGM and Fox, they’re going to be Disney and Disney+, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, HBO Max and Peacock.”

Many of the pivots in 2020 can be chalked up to the unusual circumstances. But several studios are making more long-term realignments around streaming. WarnerMedia, the AT&T conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. (founded in 1923), is now run by Jason Kilar, best known as the former chief executive of Hulu. Last month, Disney chief executive Bob Chapek, the Robert Iger heir, announced a reorganization to emphasize streaming and “accelerate our direct-to-consumer business.”

Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast, has pushed aggressively into video-on-demand. Its first major foray, “Trolls,” kicked up a feud with theater owners. But as the pandemic wore on, Universal hatched unprecedented deals with AMC and Cinemark, the largest and third-largest chains, respectively, to dramatically shorten the traditional theatrical window (usually about three months) to just 17 days. After that time, Universal can move releases that don’t reach certain box-office thresholds to digital rental.

While the nation’s second largest theater chain, Regal Cinemas, has resisted such deals, there’s widespread acknowledgement that the days of 90-day theatrical runs are over. It’s something the studios have long sought for the potential benefit of covering both platforms with one marketing campaign. Many see the pandemic as accelerating a decades-long trend.

“Windows are clearly changing,” says Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount Pictures. “All this stuff that’s going on now in the business was going to happen, the evolution is just happening faster than it would have. What would have taken three to five years is going to be done in a year, maybe a year and a half.”

That condensed period of rapid change is happening at the same time as a land rush for streaming market share, as Disney+, HBO Max, Apple and Peacock wrestle for a piece of the home viewing audience dominated by Netflix and Amazon. With theme parks struggling and worldwide box office down tens of billions, streaming is a bright spot for media companies, and the pandemic may offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lure subscribers. “Wonder Woman 1984” and “Soul” are essentially very expensive advertisements for those streaming services.

Watch below:

Each studio, depending on their corporate ownership and streaming positioning, is taking a different approach. Paramount, like Sony Pictures, doesn’t have a streaming service to offload films to. Both have held back their tentpole releases while selling more midsized films to streamers. For Paramount, “A Quiet Place: Part II,” “Top Gun Maverick” and “Mission: Impossible 7” are waiting for 2021 while “The Trial of the Chicago 7” fetched a reported $56 million from Netflix and Eddie Murphy’s “Coming to America 2” went to Amazon Prime Video for a reported $125 million.

HBO Max has had a bumpier rollout than Disney+, so “Wonder Woman 1984” is an especially critical gambit for WarnerMedia following the audacious release of “Tenet.” As the first tentpole to test theaters reopened with safety protocols and reduced capacities, it has made about $350 million worldwide — a lot considering everything but far less than originally hoped for. Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson called the “Wonder Woman” plans — which include rolling theatrical runs in China, Europe and elsewhere — “a grand experiment that could have-lasting implications if successful.”

Director Patty Jenkins acknowledged the simultaneous release was a kind of sacrifice, not just to HBO Max but to families stuck at home. “At some point you have to choose to share any love and joy you have to give, over everything else,” Jenkins wrote on Twitter.

It can be easy to cheer such moves, even if their financial performance remain cloudy (no studio has been transparent about its viewership numbers or digital grosses) and their long-term viability uncertain. Can you replicate $1 billion in box office in new subscriptions? And for how long will the one-time bounce of a new movie (unlike a series staggered over weeks or months) drive subscribers once streaming services are closer to tapping as many homes as they can?

“The whole thing is more complicated than people want it to be,” says Ira Deutchman, the veteran independent film producer and Columbia University professor. “The way movies are made and distributed, certainly at the studio level, has been really in need of change and hopefully this will bring it on. But when people hear that, it’s like: The pandemic is the straw that broke the camel’s back and now theatrical is dead. I personally feel that’s garbage.”

Deutchman considers the idea that people, after a year of quarantines and lockdowns, won’t want to leave their living room “ludicrous.” But he does imagine continued mergers and acquisitions, and “a new equilibrium” for distributors and theater owners.

So what could that mean on the other side of COVID, if moviegoers are once again comfortable sitting in packed theaters on opening weekend? It will almost certainly mean the months-long runs of films like “Titanic” or “Get Out” are a thing of the past. It could mean variable pricing on different nights. It could mean an even greater division between the franchise films of the multiplex and the boutique art house, with everything in between going straight to streaming.

But after decades of slow but steady decline in attendance, most think movie theaters will have to innovate in a way other than raising ticket prices.

“The outlook is pretty dire in terms of being a major theatrical exhibitor,” says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. He imagines shortened windows will mean few films — even the Marvel releases — ascending to $1 billion in worldwide box office. He can see some studios, like Disney, operating their own theaters as “mini-theme parks” with merchandising stuffing the lobbies.

In the meantime, theaters are hoping for much-needed relief from Congress. With the virus surging, about 40% of U.S. theaters are open; in New York and Los Angeles, they’ve stayed shut since March. Chains have taken on loans to stay afloat and avert bankruptcy. Cineworld, owner of Regal Cinemas (currently entirely closed) on Monday announced a deal for a $450 million rescue loan.

It will be a very different holiday season — usually the most lucrative corridor in theaters — for the movie business. How different 2021 and beyond will be remains to be seen. Some things, though, may never change.

“If you’re going to be in this business, no matter what you do or where it plays, whether it’s streaming or in cinemas, you’re going to make hits and you’re going to make flops,” says Guber. “The idea is to make more hits than flops.”",BreitBart,-1
Music Legends Van Morrison and Eric Clapton Team for Anti-Lockdown Anthem ‘Stand and Deliver’,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Rock music legends Van Morrison and Eric Clapton have teamed up for “Stand and Deliver,” a song that takes coronavirus lockdowns to task.

“There are many of us who support Van and his endeavors to save live music; he is an inspiration,” Clapton said according to Variety. “We must stand up and be counted because we need to find a way out of this mess. The alternative is not worth thinking about. Live music might never recover.”

Clapton also said that the end of live entertainment due to coronavirus lockdowns is “deeply upsetting.”

Proceeds for the track — set to be released on December 4 — will go to Morrison’s Lockdown Financial Hardship Fund, which works to lend financial assistance to musicians left struggling during the global pandemic and the mitigation lockdowns imposed across the world.

“It is heartbreaking to see so many talented musicians lack any meaningful support from the government, but we want to reassure them that we are working hard every day to lobby for the return of live music, and to save our industry,” Morrison added upon release of news of his Clapton collaboration.

According to his website, Morrison’s fund has already disbursed its first allotments. Still, the group promises that more money will soon be raised for a second round of donations to struggling artists.

Van Morrison has already released several songs that are critical of the lockdowns, including “Born To Be Free,” “As I Walked Out,” and “No More Lockdown.”

Morrison’s criticism of lockdowns has stirred controversy in certain circles, especially among government officials. The “Moondance” singer recently drew criticism from Northern Ireland’s health minister Robin Swann who called the protest songs “dangerous.”

“I don’t know where he gets his facts. I know where the emotions are on this,” Swann told BBC in September, “but I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous.” As Rolling Stone reported, Morrison has for decades voiced grievances through song, but “this time, Morrison’s preferred method of venting might also cause harm to others.”

"Bette Midler: Doctors Should Sue over SCOTUS Protecting Rights of ‘Super Spreader’ Churches, Synagogues",['David Ng'],"Bette Midler wants doctors and nurses to sue over the Supreme Court’s recent 5-4 ruling confirming the First Amendment rights of people to gather for religious purposes. The Hollywood star said that these “super spreader” events will eventually become a burden on health-care workers.

On Monday, Midler tweeted her disbelief that the high court is allowing people to gather in houses of worship.

“Packing the Supreme Court really works, but for whom? Why do the religious get to gather in super spreader groups, if they will sicken rest of us?” she wrote. “And when they get sick why should any stressed out health-care worker be forced to look after them? Doctors and nurses should sue.”

The Hocus Pocus star made no mention of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and riots that have taken place in cities across the country, bringing together thousands of protestors in close proximity during the coronavirus pandemic.

Midler also expressed her support for virtual religious services where worshippers practice their faith remotely.

As Breitbart News reported, the Supreme Court’s ruling represents a major victory for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in their fight against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) restrictions, which limited house of worship attendance to 10 to 25 people. The plaintiffs argued that the limits violated religious freedom under the First Amendment.

Newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the majority in the case, while Chief Justice John Roberts sided with liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Bette Midler vocally opposed President Donald Trump’s Constitutional right to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s Supreme Court seat. She attacked Coney Barrett for her religious affiliations while calling her “the ultimate product” of the Koch brothers, the Heritage Foundation, and other conservative groups.

#AmyConeyBarret, on Board of a school that won’t allow in a student with a gay parent, has been groomed for decades, the ultimate product of #theKochs, #TheFederalists, #TheHeritageFoundation.

"Former Aide Mocks Andrew Cuomo for Victory Book, ‘Depressing' Emmy Win",['Joshua Caplan'],"Alexis Grenell, a former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), has slammed her former boss over his conduct during the coronavirus pandemic in a searing op-ed published Thursday in The Nation.

“The Andrew Cuomo New Yorkers know and mostly tolerate, the snarling attack dog who gaslights fellow Democrats and deploys staff to call his female critics ‘f—-g idiots,’ dropped down to Earth last week. It was a hard landing after a long-distance love affair with a fanbase in a galaxy far, far away,” said Grenell, who served as Cuomo’s deputy director of intergovernmental affairs during his time as New York’s attorney general.

Grenell took aim at Cuomo for penning a victory-lap book — American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic — touting his handling of the pandemic, which has yet to conclude.

“It all boils down to this: Any dissent is a partisan attack on our very lives, and Andrew Cuomo is our only hope,” she wrote. “To solidify the narrative, he’s even written a self-congratulatory book at what he calls ‘half-time‘ in the crisis. Kind of like how every coach puts out a press release mid-game and Winston Churchill wrote the history of World War II in 1943. Oh, wait…”

Grenell then mocked Cuomo for accepting an International Emmy award for his televised briefings on the pandemic.

“The whole thing was already very Through the Looking Glass before the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced on Friday that they were awarding the governor an Emmy for his “television shows with characters, plot lines, and stories of success and failure,” the former aide wrote.

“There’s something genuinely depressing about seeing the son of a man who refused a seat on the Supreme Court so eager to be flattered by Ben Stiller,” she added. “It’s almost hard to remember how he ridiculed two-time Emmy Award–winner Cynthia Nixon back in 2018 for being an unqualified celebrity.”

Cuomo and his office have not yet responded to Grenell’s essay.

Grenell’s sharp criticism came as the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a hard blow to Cuomo’s restrictions on religious services.

As Breitbart News reported:

On Wednesday evening, the high court ruled in favor 5-4 with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in their lawsuit alleging Cuomo’s gathering restrictions, which limited house of worship attendance from 10 to 25 people, violated religious freedom under the First Amendment.

Cuomo bitterly dismissed the Court’s ruling, calling the decision “irrelevant.”",BreitBart,-1
Hollywood Storms Georgia: Kevin Bacon Hosting Celebrity Fundraiser for Pro-Democrat Group,['David Ng'],"Georgia is ground zero in the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C., as control of the U.S. Senate now hinges on the outcome of the two Senate runoff races in the Peach State. With the Senate majority leadership within his reach, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” Now Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are reportedly the latest Hollywood celebrities to lend their star power to Democrats in Georgia, hoping to boost the chances of candidates Raphael Warrnock and Jon Ossoff and turn the Senate blue.

The acting power couple will join comedian Billy Eichner and Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. in a fundraiser for Swing Left, one of many progressive organizations that is mobilizing Democratic turnout in Georgia, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Maze Runner producer Ellen Goldsmith-Vein will co-host the December 3 event.

Swing Left is among the many progressive groups that have set their sights on Georgia ahead of the state’s January 5 runoffs. The organization, which was founded in the wake of President Trump’s 2016 victory, has specialized in recruiting celebrities to push its agenda, including Broadway and Homeland star Mandy Patinkin.

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick teamed up with Swing Left in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, participating in podcasts and donating money to the group.

Hollywood celebrities have made Georgia their top political priority in their effort to push Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock across the finish line. A-list stars including George Clooney and Will Smith have poured money into the races, while actors Kumail Nanjiani and Sophia Bush are spearheading WinBothSeats, an initiative to get out the minority vote for Democrats.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is holding a Veep reunion next month to raise money for America Votes, the left-wing group that is working to boost Democratic chances in Georgia’s runoffs. Other stars pushing Georgia Democrats on social media include Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing.

"Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Bon Jovi Pose for Coronavirus Billboards in New Jersey: ‘Wear a Friggin’ Mask!’",['David Ng'],"Drivers in New Jersey are receiving a mandatory lecture on the coronavirus thanks to a new series of billboards demanding that everyone wears a mask. The effort comes courtesy of three famous sons of the Garden State — Jon Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, and Jon Bon Jovi.

The billboards come as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) is facing widespread criticism after he and his family were caught dining out without masks after he imposed further statewide restrictions on social gatherings.

New Jersey officials unveiled the billboards this week along highways throughout the state. “Wear a friggin’ mask!” the billboards say. The three celebrities teamed up on the initiative with the New Jersey Department of Health and the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.

First lady Tammy Murphy tweeted that “as we enter the holiday season, it’s important to stay vigilant about #COVID19.” She also used the hashtag #MaskUpNJ.

Gov. Murphy (D) has come under fire after a video showed his family dining out without wearing masks. The family was accosted by passersby who hurled obscenities at them. The governor recently imposed further social restrictions on residents, ordering people to limit indoor gatherings to ten individual and outdoor gatherings to 150.

He also told New Jerseyites to keep their Thanksgiving gatherings “as small as possible.”

Rihanna Sends Support to ‘Mourning’ Native Americans On Thanksgiving,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Pop star Rihanna, whom Forbes recently named among the richest self-made women in America, with a net worth of $600 million, celebrated Thanksgiving by showing her support for Native Americans who are “mourning” during the holiday.

The Diamonds singer posted a message to her Instagram Story reading, “Some are celebrating today… many are mourning! Sending love to all my Native American brothers and sisters.”

The ocean’s 8 actress often spews political rants on her social media. A few months ago, Rihanna went on the attack against Kentucky officials over the Breonna Taylor grand jury decision. And last year, the Grammy-winner loudly rejected an offer to perform at the Super Bowl because the league had still not given national anthem protester Colin Kaepernick a job.

Rihanna was not the only pop singer to attack the Thanksgiving tradition.

Singer Demi Lovato also jumped to Instagram to undermine the Thanksgiving holiday with a series of images she took from a left-wing activist group named Showing Up For Racial Justice that made to “debunk” many of the facts people believe about the first Thanksgiving.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato)

The memes the 28-year-old HEAL singer posted were entitled “Decolonizing Thanksgiving.”

Lovato’s posts included one that debunked the claim that the first Thanksgiving occurred in 1621. “Fact,” Lovato’s meme read, “No one really knows when the ‘first’ Thanksgiving occurred.”

The meme posts continued with another that relayed the claim from the Wampanoag tribe’s “oral traditions” that claim that the pilgrims did not celebrate the day by inviting the Indians to a feast, and no invitation was ever offered to the local tribes, they claim.

Lovato’s memes also insist that it is a “myth” that the Pilgrims and the Indians became friends and insisted that English soldiers “massacred roughly 700 Pequot men, women, and children at Mystic Fort, burning many of them alive in their homes and killing those who fled.”

But as Breitbart News editor-at-large Rebecca Mansour notes in a lengthy piece, the American left’s “‘narrative of Thanksgiving’ is historically inaccurate garbage. We know who the Pilgrims are and what they did because they meticulously documented everything for posterity.”

Terrorist Friend of Ariana Grande Concert Bomber Getting Out of Prison,['Victoria Friedman'],"Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was friends with Salman Abedi and was communicating with him in the months leading up to the Manchester Arena terror attack, is due to be released from prison this week.

The inquiry into the Manchester bombing has heard in recent months the details of the two terrorists’ close relationship. Abedi had been friends with Abdallah since 2014, and they had “conversed about martyrdom” between July and November of that year. When Abdallah was on bail, Abedi took him to mosques.

The Manchester bomber then visited Abdallah in prison in 2015 and then again two years later, maintaining contact with the convicted terrorist in the intervening years. He called Abdallah regularly in the months leading up to the terror attack, notably on the same day that he received a delivery of chemicals for his suicide pack. Despite requests from lawyers, Abdallah, 27, has refused to cooperate with authorities conducting the inquiry.

Sources confirmed to Sky News on Thursday that Abdallah is due for release on licence — similar to parole — this week, after having been jailed in 2016 following a conviction for trying to help his brother and two other Islamists to travel to Syria to join Islamic State.

Some of the relatives of the victims have expressed their shock at Abdallah’s forthcoming release. The lawyer of 12 of them told The Times that it was “beyond belief” he was being released given his refusal to cooperate with the Manchester bombing inquiry, as he could shed light on many aspects of the investigation.

Lawyer Victoria Higgins of Slater & Gordon said: “The contact this man had with Salman Abedi in the weeks and months before the Arena bomb is something that the inquiry will be exploring in great detail.”

“This is truly devastating news at what has already been a hugely distressing experience for the families sitting through this inquiry,” Ms Higgins added.

""Irrespective of his supposedly strict licensing conditions, releasing Abdallah — a man who has close links to the Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi — poses a clear threat to British public safety."" My quote in @Telegraph.https://t.co/arbSHY2HtJ — Dr Rakib Ehsan (@rakibehsan) November 27, 2020

Abdallah has fully completed the custodial portion of his short sentence. He may be recalled to prison if he breaches the terms of his licence, although such conditions have failed to stop early-release terrorists before.

Abdallah was born in Libya and grew up in the same part of Manchester as the Abedi brothers. In 2010, he travelled to Tripoli to fight and was shot and seriously injured in 2011. The NHS treated him for his injuries, giving what was described as life-saving treatment, after his parents had flown him back to Britain. The jihadist was paralysed from the waist down and is wheelchair-bound.

The terrorist will be subject to a tag on his release and be restricted on his access to electronic devices such as computers. He will be banned from interacting with certain people and will be prohibited from entering Manchester city centre. Additionally, he will be ordered to attend a deradicalisation programme.

The effectiveness of deradicalisation programmes has come under scrutiny in the past 12 months, following the London Bridge terror attack committed in November 2019 by Usman Khan, who was attending a rehabilitation event when he launched his stabbing spree, killing two of the course’s facilitators. Khan was considered a “success story” of an Islamist who turned his life around. King’s College London published a paper in July revealing that terrorists are pretending to be reformed in order to secure early release.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously admitted that “really very few” Islamists are successfully reformed.

Security Guard Ignored Ariana Grande Concert Bomber ‘For Fear of Being Branded a Racist’ https://t.co/eiSKbSGbzm — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2020

Terrorism expert Dr Rakib Ehsan of the Henry Jackson Society warned that Abdallah still represents a risk to national security and should be detained in prison for the full nine-and-a-half years of his sentence.

Dr Ehsan told The Telegraph: “Irrespective of his supposedly strict licensing conditions, releasing Abdallah — a man who has close links to the Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi — poses a clear threat to British public safety.

“Given he was released automatically, without a parole hearing, we simply have no idea if he has been ‘deradicalised’ or remains a hardened fundamentalist. All this tells a story of a fundamentally flawed system for dealing with Islamist terrorists.”

The inquiry into the May 2017 terror attack revealed that Britain’s domestic security agency MI5 was aware that Abedi was in contact with Abdallah before the attack, but did not reopen their investigation into Abedi.

Trump Jr. Warns Georgians: 'My Father’s Accomplishments Are on Your Ballot',['Hannah Bleau'],"Donald Trump Jr. is warning Georgians that President Donald Trump’s accomplishments are on the ballot in the January 5th runoffs, as the results will determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which has helped enact the president’s MAGA agenda.

The president’s eldest son, who has urged Republicans in Georgia to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue against their radical left opponents, is featured in a six-figure radio ad which dropped in the Peach State on Tuesday. In the ad, Trump Jr. explains that his father’s accomplishments remain on the ballot.

The ad begins with a soundbite of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) celebrating in the streets after the media declared former Vice President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.

“Now we take Georgia, and then we change the world!” a maskless Schumer exclaimed at the time.

“The radical left wants to tear down everything we’ve accomplished,” Trump Jr. begins in the Save the U.S. Senate PAC ad.

“Defunding the police, destroying private health insurance, and dismantling the Supreme Court. They’ll take away our Second Amendment rights and make it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves in their own homes,” he continued.

“On January 5th, the U.S. Senate is on the line, and my father’s accomplishments are on your ballot,” he stressed, adding, “Don’t let Chuck Schumer and the radical left succeed. On January 5th, vote Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for Senate.”

According to Axios, the ad will air statewide on both conservative talk radio and country music stations.

Trump Jr. has remained outspoken in the weeks leading to the Georgia runoffs, addressing the rumors of “people that are supposed to be on our side” urging Republicans not to vote for the GOP incumbents.

“That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people,” the president’s eldest son said, laying into those encouraging Republicans to sit on the sidelines in the January 5th runoffs. “We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David”:

I’m seeing a lot of talk from people that are supposed to be on our side telling GOP voters not to go out & vote for @KLoeffler and @PerdueSenate. That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people. We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.#MAGA #GASEN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 23, 2020

His November 23 plea followed chatter from other conservative voices, who have publicly suggested that they will not support the GOP senators in next month’s runoffs.

“Let’s speak truth about @SenLoeffler & @sendavidperdue. Why are they doing little or nothing to support efforts by GA citizens to address unlawful election & need for @BrianKempGA to order special session of legislature?” attorney Lin Wood asked.

“If not fixed, I will NOT vote in GA runoff. Will you?” Wood inquired:

Let’s speak truth about @SenLoeffler & @sendavidperdue. Why are they doing little or nothing to support efforts by GA citizens to address unlawful election & need for @BrianKempGA to order special session of legislature? If not fixed, I will NOT vote in GA runoff. Will you? — Lin Wood (@LLinWood) November 21, 2020

Loeffler’s and Perdue’s victories are crucial for the GOP to maintain its Senate majority. The bigger picture, as Trump Jr. alluded to in the ad, is maintaining a majority to uphold the vast accomplishments Trump’s achieved over the course of the last four years.

If Democrats were to snag these two seats, it would split the Senate 50-50, giving the tiebreaker to the team controlling the White House. If Trump is successful in his various legal challenges, Vice President Mike Pence would serve as the tiebreaker. However, in a Biden White House, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who was once rated the most leftist senator in the upper chamber, would determine the direction of the Senate.

The Democrat senate candidates, Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both have histories of radical positions. A recently emerged video shows Warnock mocking the prospect of churchgoers for arming themselves:

BOMBSHELL: Newly found video shows Georgia Senate candidate @ReverendWarnock LAUGHING at church-goers who defend themselves with guns. First Warnock goes after our veterans, now our Second Amendment. Georgians have a clear choice Jan. 5! #gapol #gasen pic.twitter.com/YFtGdiqkOi — NRA (@NRA) November 30, 2020

On Sunday, Perdue’s challenger, Jon Ossoff, confessed that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to fight the Chinese coronavirus, adding that “it’s time to trust the experts”:

Both of those issues — preserving the Second Amendment and reviving the economy following coronavirus lockdowns — have remained central to Trump’s agenda, speaking to the central point Trump Jr. makes in the Georgia ad.",BreitBart,-1
Watch: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey Appears to Decline Call from President Trump,['Kyle Olson'],"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appeared to decline a call from President Donald Trump on Monday as he was signing an election certification document.

Ducey was sitting in front of reporters, pen in hand, when his phone rang:

The ring tone, “Hail to the Chief,” could be heard as Ducey took the phone out of his jacket pocket. He appeared to look at the screen, decline the call, and place the phone screen-down on the table.

MSNBC noted Ducey previously said he changed Trump’s ring tone to the presidential song so he could more easily recognize his calls.

“I had to change the ring tone on my phone and it rings ‘Hail to the Chief’ because I didn’t want to miss another phone call directly from the White House,” Ducey said in early July.

As Ducey was signing the document effectively awarding Arizona’s 11 electoral votes to Joe Biden, legislators were taking testimony from Trump’s lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and witnesses to alleged voter fraud in the state.

Trump called into the hearing and blasted Ducey, accusing him of rushing the certification process, Breitbart News reported.

“On top of it, you have a governor named Ducey,” the president said as the crowd booed. “He just rushed to sign certificates … what’s that all about? He didn’t have to sign it. I say, why would he sign when you have these incredible hearings going on that’s showing such corruption and such horrible fraud?”

"Pompeo: Israel a ‘Key Partner, Not a Problem’ in Fight Against Iran",['Deborah Danan'],"Israel is a key partner in fighting Iran and not the problem, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tuesday.

“We recognize the violent nature of the revolutionary Iranian regime, and we understand that when it comes to countering Tehran and many other important issues, Israel is a key partner, and not a problem,” Pompeo said at the virtual opening of the first U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue.

His remarks come in the wake of the assassination of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear weapons mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on Friday, which Tehran alleged Israel was behind.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said the U.S.-Israel alliance has “never been stronger” and expressed hope America’s current Middle East policy would continue. https://t.co/zF3LBZpfD5 — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 1, 2020

Pompeo called Iran “the number one threat to the Gulf’s security and to peace-loving people throughout the entire region.” Apparent president-elect Joe Biden has said he would revert to the Obama-led 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which President Donald Trump pulled out in May 2018. The deal would have seen Iran acquire the nuclear bomb by 2030. Biden has said he would seek changes to the so-called sunset clause.

According to leaked diplomatic cables, Germany, France and Britain urged the Trump administration in October to reconsider his maximum pressure campaign against Iran, in particular his sanctions on the Islamic Republic’s banks, arguing that the move would damage legitimate humanitarian trade, the Reuters news wire reported Tuesday.

Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, who also attended the U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue, called on the U.S. to continue exerting maximum pressure on Iran.

It is “essential that the international community maintains its resolve to recognize and confront such behavior, with unrelenting pressure on Iran to become a responsible actor,” Zayani said in his opening remarks.

“We want our partnership with the US to be an integral part of this process, in exposing the ongoing challenges of the theocratic [Iranian] regime and its proxies, but also ensuring Bahrain and other regional allies continue to have the capabilities to effectively protect their people against such threats,” he said.

Zayani thanked the U.S. for paving the way for the tiny Gulf kingdom to establish diplomatic relations with Israel and “a genuine, warm peace.”

Jimmy Kimmel Mocks Maria Bartiromo: She’s ‘Auditioning’ to Become Donald Trump’s Next Wife,['David Ng'],"ABC’s left-wing late night host Jimmy Kimmel took a shot at Fox Business anchor Maria Bartiromo during his late-night ABC show on Monday, mocking her recent interview with President Donald Trump and joking that she is “auditioning” to become the president’s new wife.

President Trump gave his first post-election interview to Maria Bartiromo on her Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures. During the phone interview, the president attacked the mainstream media for its refusal to run negative stories about Joe Biden, calling it “suppression by the press.”

“We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression by the press. They suppress,” the president said. “You can’t have a scandal if nobody reports about it. This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint.”

Jimmy Kimmel used the Fox News interview to mock Bartiromo, calling her “always sycophantic” when it comes to the president.

“I don’t know what happened to her, but she appears to be auditioning for the position of Donald Trump’s next wife because that was some interview,” he said.

Watch below:

Speaking of sycophantic, Kimmel recently interviewed former President Barack Obama, gushing over the former commander in chief by asking a series of softball questions to promote Obama’s new memoirs, A Promised Land.

During Monday’s show, Kimmel also mocked the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, saying that he has always hated the annual holiday tradition “I hate parades. To me, it’s just traffic with balloons.”

Watch Live: Michigan Senate Committee Holds Hearing on Absentee Ballot Counting,['Kyle Olson'],"The Michigan Senate Oversight Committee is holding a hearing on Tuesday regarding absentee ballot counting during the presidential election in Detroit.

The committee, chaired by state Sen. Ed McBroom, will take testimony related to “absentee ballot counting at the TCF Center,” according to the committee’s website.

Controversy erupted over the weekend when the committee refused to include President Trump’s attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Over 100 observers of the ballot counting process in Detroit have filed affidavits testifying to what they witnessed, which included allegations of ballots being counted multiple times, procedures not being followed, observers being blocked from being able to watch the process, and mysterious vehicles showing up in the middle of the night to deliver additional ballots.

The Wayne County Board of Canvassers initially declined to certify the results from the jurisdiction that includes Detroit, before the two Republican members reversed their votes after hours of withering personal attacks by Joe Biden supporters and Democrat activists.

They then attempted to reverse the reversal, but were unsuccessful. The State Board of Canvassers certified Michigan’s results 3-0, with one Republican abstaining from the vote.

Sources tell Breitbart News that the hearings are intended to collect information that may influence potential reforms for future elections.

House Oversight Committee chairman Matt Hall announced on Tuesday that Giuliani will now be appearing in person on Wednesday.

"GOP Rep. Stefanik: Pelosi Losing Leverage, Controlled by the Far-Left in AOC",['Jeff Poor'],"Tuesday on FNC’s “Fox & Friends,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) laid out a dynamic in the House of Representatives as the White House, and the Senate Republicans worked to hammer out an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on a COVID-19 relief package.

According to Stefanik, Pelosi’s grip on the control of the House was slipping as more so-called progressive Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), were on the rise.

“I think Mitch is exactly right. Speaker Pelosi has walked away again and again and again from negotiations,” she said. “There are a number of provisions that we agree on. For example, additional aid to small businesses who are continuing to suffer, particularly as we head into this holiday and retail season. Direct support for K-12 schools. That legislation would be signed into law today or yesterday if Speaker Pelosi would negotiate in good faith. Instead, she played politics leading up to the election, and she lost.”

“She lost every single toss-up seat in the country,” Stefanik continued. “Republicans have picked up numerous seats, and we’re continuing to pick them with an Iowa House seat and a California House seat. She is losing her leverage by the day. And I think the reality is if she can get her votes for speaker, which is still an open question, she is controlled by the far-left in AOC. So she’s going to have to go to them to get their approval.”

"Cotton: ‘Shortsighted,’ ‘Dangerous’ for Biden to Reenter Iran Nuclear Deal",['Jeff Poor'],"In an appearance on Fox News Channel’s “The Story” on Monday, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) warned against the United States rejoining the Iran nuclear deal canceled by President Donald Trump under a potential future Biden administration.

The Arkansas Republican lawmaker said the act would be shortsighted and dangerous.

“I just can’t imagine that the Biden administration, for instance, would lift sanctions against the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps,” he said. “The Trump administration imposed those sanctions. The IRGC is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. And I’m sure that the Iranian leadership would demand that those sanctions be lifted. The IRGC has its tentacles throughout the Iranian economy. That’s why so many ayatollahs are also multi-billionaires.”

“Is the Biden administration really going to lift sanctions against the shock troops of Iran’s terror regime?” Cotton continued. “Are they really going to send hundreds of billions of dollars back to the ayatollahs? Are they really going to go back into a deal that doesn’t touch on any of Iran’s activity besides its nuclear arsenal, some of which is already starting to sunset because the deadlines in that nuclear deal five years ago were so short, but that’s what it would take to reenter this nuclear deal? That’s why it would be so shortsighted and so dangerous.”

Boris Johnson to Repeal Election-Busting Law That Almost Killed Brexit,['Oliver Jj Lane'],"A David Cameron-era law that left Britain’s government paralysed and Brexit at the mercy of what transpired to be an unrepresentative Parliament is being repealed, returning a small part of the UK constitution to the long-term historical norm.

The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act is set to be repealed by Boris Johnson’s Conservative government just nine years after it was voted into power by another Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron. The law, which changed the way general elections were called from being events that could either be voluntary by the government or forced on them by events, to being fixed on a permanent five-year cycle, was passed during the 2010 coalition government to appease the junior governing partner, Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats.

While the concept of fixed-term parliaments was part of a raft of major changes to Britain’s unwritten, and generally quite longstanding and time-tested, constitution wanted by the Liberal Democrats — including a total change to the nation’s election system to benefit smaller challenger parties like themselves — the introduction of the law had very specific consequences in the life of the last parliament, as members weaponised the job security it gave them to delay and sabotage the Brexit process for six painful months.

British broadsheet The Times reports the remarks of a Tory insider who said of the decision to push ahead with scrapping the act: “The Fixed-term Parliaments Act caused constitutional chaos last year which, when combined with gridlock in parliament, meant the previous government couldn’t deliver what it was asked to do. Ultimately, at critical moments, we trust the public to decide. So we are going back to the system that lets elections happen when they are needed.”

Would Turkeys Vote For Christmas? Why MPs Will Resist Boris Johnson’s Snap Election https://t.co/yaWidxRhwh — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 4, 2019

Through the leadership of Theresa May and Boris Johnson, the government was repeatedly defeated on Brexit votes, events under the old system that would have seen the government collapse and a new general election called. But because the law prevented that from happening, anti-Brexit rebels on both sides of the house were able to constantly throw roadblocks in the way of the Brexit process but not face the judgement of the voters.

In an effort to block the deadlock, Boris Johnson attempted to call a general election three times, but was prevented by doing so by rebel MPs invoking the act on every occasion. Even though it was becoming increasingly clear the country supported Brexit being done, a legacy parliament that did not represent that attitude clung on to power beyond its natural life through the act.

Eventually, the government was able to pass a simple law overriding the act to sign into existence a one-off election, which the Conservatives — campaigning heavily on a platform of making Brexit happen — won in a major landslide, even taking northern left-wing seats that hadn’t voted Conservative in generations. The haughty attitude of Labour’s London-based ‘metropolitan elite’ leaders towards Brexit was widely blamed for this defeat.

Another promise made by the Conservatives in that election was to repeal the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, to prevent a so-called ‘zombie parliament’ holding the country to ransom again, both by preventing the government from governing while at the same time preventing a new government from being elected. As Breitbart London reported in December when the government started to move forwards with abolishing the act, Vernon Bogdanor, Professor of Government at King’s College London outlined some of the issued with the act that would be dismissed with its repeal.

Professor Bogdanor said the 2011 law was “full of holes” and, perhaps being charitable, remarked that when it was written the authors may have not foreseen the situation which came to pass where “the government had lost control of the Commons, Her Majesty’s Opposition would, for tactical reasons, refuse an election”.

The ability of the government to collapse is, the professor said, in fact a “vital safeguard against inter-party manoeuvrings and shenanigans”.",BreitBart,-1
Boris Faces Massive Tory Rebellion over Coronavirus Restrictions,['Victoria Friedman'],"Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion of up to 100 Conservative MPs planning to vote against putting 99 per cent of England under the top two strictest coronavirus measures.

The prime minister’s proposals from last week revealed that despite England being under a month-long lockdown during November, more of the country will find itself in a higher tier coming out of shutdown than going in, with just Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in Tier 1.

Conservative MPs were outraged by the recommended demarcations, calling the measures “authoritarian”, with others saying that the “wheels are coming off the government’s arguments” to continue imposing them.

14.6 million more people in England are now in Tier 3 compared to pre-lockdown, when cases were also falling.

Lockdowns don’t work. pic.twitter.com/wtNDkMJjli — The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 29, 2020

MPs are set to vote on the measures in the House of Commons today, with media reporting that as many as between 50 and 100 Tories will rebel against their own government and vote against them, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.

The Guardian has also reported that Labour plans to abstain from voting, because the financial support, derived from taxpayers, for the hospitality industry must go further than the government’s recovery package.

Tier 2 bans socialising indoors with anyone outside their house or support bubble and limits it to six outdoors, while Tier 3 prohibits any mixing with people not in your household or bubble inside or in most outdoor settings. Tier 3 also sees pubs, bars, and restaurants close unless they can function as takeaways, while in Tier 2, alcohol at hospitality venues can only be served with a ‘substantial meal’.

Conservative lockdown sceptics from the COVID Recovery Group won a minor battle in forcing the Johnson administration to release the impact assessments that informed the government’s decision, but MPs are said to be disappointed with the document, described as “thin” and containing a “rehashed” and frustrating analysis.

“We are now seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the government’s arguments.”

Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith called the document a “cut and paste job”, insinuating that the government had provided no new analysis at all.

David Mamet Calls Out ‘Experts’ and Questions Lockdowns: ‘The Virus Here Is Government’,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called “experts” and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence—and they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ — WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

“We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.”

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. “One is ‘permitted’ to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?”

David Mamet compares today’s coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. “Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,” he added. “The news media, backed by those parts of the ‘scientific community’ the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.”

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

“A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.”

Labour Party Could Expel ‘Thousands’ of Members for Anti-Semitism,['Kurt Zindulka'],"The deputy leader of the British Labour Party, Angela Rayner, has threatened that thousands of members could be expelled from the party an effort to purge anti-Semitism from their ranks.

On Sunday, Mrs Rayner told members of the party that Labour has to “get real” about anti-Semitism after a Jewish member was forced to leave a constituency party meeting in Nottingham due to a “hostile” environment as some pushed for a restoration of the whip to former leader Jeremy Corbyn.

In response to the incident, the deputy leader said per Sky News: “We should have a bit of humility, humbleness, and we should be listening and we should be aware of how hurt and upset people are.”

“And if I have to suspend thousands and thousands of members, we will do that. Because we cannot and we will not accept an injury to one, because an injury to one is an injury to all. That’s what we say in our movement,” Rayner warned.

In October, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) released a report on antisemitism, which found that the Labour Party was responsible for “unlawful acts of harassment and discrimination” against Jewish people under the leadership of radical socialist Jeremey Corbyn.

Mr Corbyn rejected the findings of the report, claiming that the issue of anti-Semitism issue within the party was “dramatically overstated for political reasons”. As a result of his refusal to accept blame or apologise, Corbyn was suspended by the party.

While he was later reinstated, Corbyn’s replacement as leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has refused to restore the whip to him in parliament, meaning he cannot sit as a Labour MP.

Labour Antisemitism Report Found Borderline ‘Neo-Nazis’ in the Party https://t.co/ItUKwGXsF9 — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2020

Mrs Rayner said that she “knew” that Corbyn would refuse to accept the report, saying: “Because I don’t think Jeremy really quite gets how upsetting it is, how really upsetting it is when he made those comments.”

“It is a matter of public record now that I contacted Jeremy to try and get him not to say what he said, and to apologise and withdraw it afterwards,” she said.

Sir Keir Starmer has also taken aim at the former far-left leader of the party, describing Corbyn’s response to the EHRC report as “just about as bad as you could get”.

“We’ve got this very wrong in recent years and I’m determined we’re going to turn this around,” he said, adding: “I’ve made it my number one priority and I think we made some progress in the early months.”

Campaign Against Antisemitism: Corbyn’s Labour Party ‘Existential Threat’ to Jews https://t.co/4OtE5jKW4W — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) June 10, 2019

The latest dust-up over the anti-Semitism issue came in response to a Constituency Labour Party (CLP) meeting in Nottingham last Friday, in which the chair of the meeting, Louise Regan, allowed a motion to restore the whip to Mr Corbyn to be tabled, in violation of the party’s rules.

A local Jewish constituent present at the meeting, Steve Lapsley, 50, said that the environment was so “hostile” against him that he was forced to leave.

Lapsley told the members during the meeting that he had previously been told by another party member “we do not want Jews in the party”, yet claimed that a witness to incident denied that there was anti-Semitism in the party on Friday.

“It was very triggering. The suspension of Jeremy Corbyn has really upped the anger,” he said but went on to proclaim that despite everything, he will remain in the Labour Party.

The Russians also tweeted an image of the Psaki wearing the hat in 2014.

The Biden team explained it was a gift from the Russians according to Fox News reporter Sam Dorman, and noted such exchanges were common on foreign trips. They cited an instance where former Secretary of State John Kerry gave Lavrov two Idaho potatoes.

Paul Krugman Claims ‘Democrats Never Said Trump Was Illegitimate’; Krugman Said So in 2017,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Byron York of the Washington Examiner caught New York Times columnist Paul Krugman in an easily disprovable lie on Tuesday: claiming that Democrats never called President Donald Trump illegitimate, when he himself did so in 2017.

Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist-turned-partisan pundit, wrote Monday:

When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge — and I don’t mean the pandemic, although Covid-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he’ll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.

As York noted, Krugman published a column on January 16, 2017 — four days before Trump’s inauguration — in which he quoted Democrat Rep. John Lewis calling Trump illegitimate, and agreed with them. The title of the column was “With All Due Disrespect.” In it, Krugman wrote:

But let’s not talk about Mr. Trump’s ravings. Instead, let’s ask whether Mr. Lewis was right to say what he said. Is it O.K., morally and politically, to declare the man about to move into the White House illegitimate? Yes, it is. In fact, it’s an act of patriotism. … [N]o previous U.S. president-elect has had less right to the title. So why shouldn’t we question his legitimacy?

York noted that leading Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, openly declared that Trump was illegitimate and spent four years trying to remove him by any means possible, including the flimsy impeachment of 2019-2020.

York concludes: “The attempt to throw it all down the memory hole is more than just an embarrassment for Krugman and the New York Times. It also encourages a sense of grievance — They won’t accept Biden’s legitimacy! — that is utterly ignorant of recent events. Some Democrats not only declared Donald Trump an illegitimate president before he was even sworn in — they spent the next years trying to remove him from office, abusing the powers of investigation in the hope that even if he survived he would be so weakened that he could not win re-election. No one should forget — or ignore — what happened.”

World Urged to Drink Australian Wine to Hit Back at 'Bully' Beijing,['Simon Kent'],"Buy an Australian bottle of wine or two (or three) in December and show Chinese President Xi Jinping the world will not be cowed by his “bullying of Australia.”

That was the simple call Tuesday from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), comprising more than 200 MPs from a range of political parties and representing 19 country legislatures.

The political grouping has launched a campaign to convince people to enjoy Australian wine in December, as a show of solidarity with the land Down Under, as The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The call to drink up comes just three days after Beijing turned the screws on Australian wine exports with punitive tariffs of up to 212 percent, essentially closing off a U.S.$1 billion market.

As Breitbart News reported, biting new Chinese trade tariffs across the board have stoked fears Australia’s virus-weakened economy is being targeted for political retribution and the two countries may be sliding into a shadow trade war after a year-long confrontation that began with claims over the origins of the coronavirus.

The Herald reports the global alliance of cross-party representatives, who have banded together to try to counter China’s increasing aggression particularly against Australia, released a video in which MPs from Japan, Italy, Germany, the United States and even Australia’s wine-producing rival New Zealand, among others, urge their citizens to enjoy an Australian drop.

“Italy is the country that exports the most wine of any country in the world,” Italian Democratic Party Senator Roberto Rampi says in Italian, holding up a bottle of Italian red. “C’mon, who needs wine when you have Aquavit?” jokes Norway’s former Liberal party leader and MP Trine Skei Grande. #SolidaritywithAustralia

Japanese sake is the best!” says Shiori Yamao, an independent member of Japan’s House of Representatives before Republican Senator Ted Yoho declares “two words – Napa Valley”, before saying it is time to “drink something a little bit different” and buy Australian wine, “because our friends need our help”. “We are asking you all to join us in standing against Xi Jinping’s authoritarian bullying,” says Miriam Lexmann, a Christian Democrat Member of the European Parliament. “By drinking a bottle or two of Australian wine and letting the Chinese Communist Party know that we will not be bullied,” says Swedish Christian Democratic, Elisabet Lann, a municipal councillor who holds up a glass of Penfolds. Even the U.S. National Security Council has joined the fray. It tweeted Australian wine would be featured at a White House function this week. “Pity vino lovers in China who, due to Beijing’s coercive tariffs on Aussie vintners, will miss out,” the post said, along with the hashtag “AussieAussieAussieOiOiOi”.",BreitBart,-1
Prince Harry Climate Plea: 'What If Every One of Us Was a Raindrop?',['Simon Kent'],"Prince Harry admits his world view has changed since parenthood, urging humans to care more and be “like raindrops” which “relieve the parched ground” to tackle climate change.

The Duke of Sussex, 36, who lives with his family on a $14.65-million estate in California, spoke of his passion for nature and Africa during a television exchange to feature in an upcoming documentary, continuing his love of offering advice on climate matters that peaked 12 months ago with his enthusiastic endorsement of Greta Thunberg, as Breitbart News reported.

Speaking about his son Archie, now 19 months, the Daily Mail reports Harry said: “Being in nature is the most healing part of life, I truly believe that’s one reason why it’s there.”

He then said “the moment you become a father, everything really does change because then you start to realise, well, what is the point in bringing a new person in to this world when they get to your age and it’s on fire?”

Harry spoke of the importance of “putting the dos behind the says” when it comes to tackling climate change and conservation, before imploring everyone on the planet to examine their souls, musing:

Every single raindrop that falls from the sky relieves the parched ground. What if every single one of us was a raindrop, and if every single one of us cared?

Harry reflected on the “universally tough year” everyone has experienced during the coronavirus epidemic, adding he has found comfort in nature, which he believes is the “most healing part of life.”

“Someone said to me right at the start of the pandemic, ‘It’s almost as though Mother Nature has sent us to our rooms for bad behaviour’,'”he observed.

The Duke has long stressed his concern for the future of the planet, offering thoughts and solutions along with active campaigning while flying around the globe.

Pope Francis Calls for ‘New Social Justice’ to Challenge Utopia,['Thomas D. Williams'],"ROME — Pope Francis called for a “new social justice” Sunday in which all well-intentioned people will challenge the reigning utopia.

Addressing “social justice judges” from the African and American continents via streaming, the pope congratulated them for their commitment to “social rights,” asserting that the very fact that men and women “come together to think about their work and to build the new social justice is, without a doubt, excellent news.”

The pontiff, who has been a vocal proponent of a “great reset” after the coronavirus pandemic, urged his hearers to “not lose sight of the distressing picture in which a small part of humanity lives in opulence, while an increasingly large number lives without dignity with their most elementary rights ignored or violated.”

“We cannot think disconnected from reality,” he said. “And this is a reality that you must bear in mind.”

Pope Francis has called on Christians to break down walls and embrace a love without borders in a new encyclical letter released on Sunday. https://t.co/6THB1aGBPb — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 4, 2020

The pope insisted that social justice is “a collective work” in which all people of good will challenge the reigning utopia. “Justice is a task that has to be conquered every day, because the imbalance is a temptation of every minute,” he said.

Justice also involves overcoming the temptation to ignore others, “especially the weakest,” Francis said, lamenting that “we have become used to sidestepping or ignoring situations until they impact us directly.”

“Unconditional commitment means taking charge of the pain of the other and not slipping into a culture of indifference,” he added.

In their task of bringing about a “new social justice for the planet,” the pope urged his hearers to pay attention to history, to draw inspiration from “the struggles, the triumphs, and the defeats” of those who gave their lives for “a full and integrated humanity.”

This effort will only succeed if it takes place as a grassroots initiative involving all people, “without pretending to be an enlightened elite,” Francis said, because “what God asks of us believers is to be God’s people, not God’s elite.”

In the battle for social justice solidarity is necessary to overcome “the structural causes of poverty, inequality, lack of work, land and housing,” he said.

Pope Francis reflected Wednesday on the importance of the intercession of the Virgin Mary, proposing that without her intervention at the wedding feast in Cana the guests would have drunk milk rather than wine. https://t.co/zwMeQtwEtI — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 19, 2020

We must fight, he said, “against those who deny social and labor rights” and “against a culture that leads people to use others, to enslave others, and ends up taking away the dignity of others.”

When we give essential things to the poor, he said, “we do not give them our things, or that of third parties, but we give them back what is theirs.”

The Christian tradition “never recognized the right to private property as absolute and untouchable,” he added, but “always emphasized its social function in any of its forms.”

“There is no social justice that can be based on inequity, which involves the concentration of wealth,” he said.

Coronavirus Robs Biblical Bethlehem of Christmas Cheer,['Breitbart News'],"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) — The coronavirus has cast a pall over Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem, all but shutting down the biblical town revered as Jesus’ birthplace at the height of the normally cheery holiday season.

Missing are the thousands of international pilgrims who normally descend upon the town. Restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops are closed. The renowned Christmas tree lighting service will be limited to a small group of authorized people, as will church services on Christmas Eve.

“Bethlehem is dead,” said Maryana al-Arja, owner of the 120-room Angel Hotel on the outskirts of Bethlehem.

The hotel was the site of the West Bank’s first coronavirus outbreak — when a group of Greek tourists came down with the virus last March.

She kept her 25 workers on staff for several months but ultimately couldn’t continue to pay them. Al-Arja, who herself was infected with the virus, said she has been forced to close the hotel and lay off the entire staff because there is no sign of the pandemic ending or tourists visiting anytime soon.

“We had 351 tourist groups booked in our hotel this year, each one 150 people,” she said. “But they all canceled.”

Elyas al-Arja, the head of the city’s hotel association, said Bethlehem received some 3 million tourists in 2019. With Israel, the main entry point for international visitors to the region, banning tourists because of the coronavirus crisis, and the West Bank’s border crossing with Jordan closed to foreigners, that number is close to zero this year, he said.

“Sixty percent of the city relies on tourism, and their income disappeared when the tourists disappeared,” said al-Arja, a cousin of the Angel Hotel owner.

The Ambassador Hotel, which is located near the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, has reopened one floor in hopes that some local visitors may want to come celebrate in the coming weeks.

Mahmoud Tarman, the hotel’s receptionist, said the Ambassador has brought back eight of its 60 workers to serve local guests. But with the West Bank’s economy devastated by repeated lockdowns, it remains unclear how many people will come.

“At this time of the year, this empty hotel would be bustling with life. But as you see, there is no life, not even a Christmas tree yet,” he said as he pointed at the empty lobby.

The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, this week imposed a new nighttime lockdown to help contain a spike in coronavirus cases. People must remain indoors from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m., and Bethlehem is included in the lockdown.

Officials say the lockdown could be extended through Christmas and into the new year if the infection levels don’t come down. The Health Ministry has reported a total of about 65,000 coronavirus cases in the West Bank, and over 620 deaths.

Bethlehem’s mayor, Anton Salman, said the city had planned to receive 3,000 invited guests, including local scout troops and musical bands from around the world that normally entertain visitors during Christmas Eve festivities.

He said the famed Christmas tree lighting, scheduled on Thursday, will be limited to just 15 guests, including local mayors, the district governor and the Latin Patriarch and other clergy. The 85-year-old Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who usually joins the celebration, has been invited but has not said whether he will attend.

Midnight Mass, a solemn event led by the Latin Patriarch that is usually attended by religious leaders, local VIPs and hundreds of pilgrims from around the world, has also been scaled back, Salman said. He said officials are still working on the guest list, but it is expected to include religious leaders and some foreign diplomats. The event will be closed to the general public but broadcast live for people to watch.

“No one can hold the responsibility of inviting large numbers of people to Christmas events,” he said. “Nothing will be the same during the pandemic.”",BreitBart,-1
SF Archbishop Says New Church Closures Violate Religious Freedom,['Thomas D. Williams'],"San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said this weekend a new ban on worship violates a “a natural and a Constitutional right.”

Archbishop Cordileone objected to the state’s lumping together of religious worship with “non-essential indoor activities such as gyms, movie theaters, and museums” while arbitrarily allowing “for indoor retail at 25 percent capacity and permits massage parlors, hair and nail salons, and tattoo parlors to operate indoors.”

In his statement, the archbishop criticized a new health order from the state of California that places San Francisco and San Mateo Counties into a more restrictive “purple” tier of coronavirus restrictions, which unfairly denigrates the right to religious worship.

“This is precisely the kind of blatant discrimination to which the Supreme Court gave injunctive relief in New York,” Cordileone said, in reference to last Wednesday’s SCOTUS ruling barring the state from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship.

Even in a pandemic, “the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 5-4 decision. “The restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious liberty.”

England’s faith leaders have united in calling on the UK government to permit public worship during the forthcoming lockdown in England, insisting that such worship is “essential.” https://t.co/FohO0VnRAE — Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 3, 2020

The San Francisco archbishop insisted in his statement that for Catholic Christians, worship of God and the reception of the sacraments are “essential” activities.

“The government is demoting worship to the same status as watching a movie: ‘non-essential,’” Cordileone said. “But worship is both a natural and a Constitutional right. My people want to receive the Body and Blood of Christ; they need it, and have every right to be free to do so.”

Cordileone also insisted that his archdiocese has adhered scrupulously to measures mandated to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

“Catholics in San Francisco are absolutely committed to public safety in conducting worship services,” he said. “Our protocols require masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation.”

“But the government still chooses to treat worship as less important than shopping for shoes,” he added.

While declaring that he is “deeply sympathetic to public health concerns about a surge in COVID hospitalizations,” the archbishop also noted that “we know of no cases of transmission of the virus as a result of in-person worship inside of our churches.”

No Twitter ‘Fact Check’ Warning on Chinese Official’s Fake Photo of Australian Soldier Beheading Child,['Simon Kent'],"Twitter on Tuesday rejected Canberra’s calls to remove a Beijing official’s gruesome tweet targeting Australian troops, choosing instead to stand with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As Breitbart News reported, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded Beijing apologize after a top CCP official posted an obviously contrived image on Twitter depicting an Australian soldier with his knife to a child’s throat, appearing to prepare to behead the victim.

Morrison described the post by the official Twitter account of Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as an “outrageous and disgusting slur” at a virtual news conference in Canberra on Monday.

AFP reports Twitter said it had since marked the tweet as “sensitive,” but added comments on topical political issues or “foreign policy sabre-rattling” by official government accounts were generally not in violation of its rules.

Twitter is banned for most citizens in China and Beijing has for decades been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

Some Australian allies expressed concern over the tweet, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with the support coming as Australia looks to strengthen its alliances in the Indo/Pacific region as a guard against Beijing’s increasingly strident diplomacy.

“In this case an image has been used that is not factually correct, that is not a genuine image, so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities,” she told reporters.

The French foreign affairs ministry said the post was “unworthy of the diplomatic standards we have the right to expect from a country like China”.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra dismissed the criticism, instead accusing Australia of making too much of the incident.

“The rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr. Zhao’s tweet,” the spokesperson said.

The embassy suggested Australian officials were attempting to “deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers” and “stoke domestic nationalism.”

UK Minister: You Might Be Banned from Venues Without Vaccine Passport,['Victoria Friedman'],"The UK’s new vaccine minister Nadim Zahawi has said that while coronavirus vaccinations will not be mandatory, Britons may be barred from going to the cinema or getting on an aeroplane without it if service providers demand proof of inoculation.

Conservative MP Nadim Zahawi is the newly-appointed Minister for COVID Vaccine Deployment and will oversee the rollout of the vaccination in England.

Mr Zahawi said that of the three vaccines currently being developed in the UK — by Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Moderna — the Pfizer product is the most far along and likely to be widely rolled out first.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s World at One on Monday, Mr Zahawi confirmed that the vaccine would not be compulsory and would remain voluntary.

However, the demand for “immunity passports” to secure service — such as by Australian airline Qantas — may make the jabs effectively compulsory by any other definition.

When host Sarah Montague asked if could follow that British businesses could demand an immunity passport before a person can go to a stadium to watch a football match, the COVID vaccination minister did not deny such an outcome, rather adding that the government was looking for a system comparable to the NHS’s ‘Test and Trace’ app, which tracks the spread of coronavirus.

Mr Zahawi said: “We are looking at the technology and of course a way of people informing their GP that they’ve been vaccinated.

“But also I think you’ll probably find that restaurants, bars, and cinemas and other venues — sports venues — will probably also use that system as they’ve done with the app.”

The Times had reported on Monday that the NHS is working on updating the Test and Trace app to include the information in its data architecture so that Britons can confirm their inoculation status.

The vaccine tsar admitted that without the availability of Big Government’s tech, there would be no demand for such ‘COVID passports’ by service providers, saying: “In many ways, the pressure from both ways: from service providers who will say, ‘Demonstrate to us that you’ve been vaccinated,’ but also we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.”

Sarah Montague asked Mr Zahawi whether or not it would become “virtually impossible to do anything if you don’t have the vaccine”, with the minister responding: “I think people have to make a decision, but I think you’ll probably find many service providers will want to engage in this in the way they did with the [Test and Trace] app.”

The minister’s comments come after reports that the government is also working on coronavirus stamps for passports in order to boost the travel and tourism industry. The government is also reportedly working on so-called “freedom passes” for those who have tested negative for the Chinese coronavirus, which could allow them to be free from having to wear a mask or to visit family members during lockdowns.

Former Brexit Party MEP, now Lady Fox of Buckley in the House of Lords, Claire Fox responded to Zahawi’s remarks on Monday evening, saying: “When Boris assured us that no-one would be forced to vaccinate, he forgot to add, ‘but if you don’t, you will be effectively prevented from being part of the public sphere, ever’. Public shaming next? I want to be an enthusiastic advocate for vaccines. This COERCION doesn’t help.”",BreitBart,-1
Farage: China is ‘Licking its Chops’ at the Thought of a Biden Presidency,['Kurt Zindulka'],"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is “licking its chops” at the thought of a Joe Biden presidency, warned Brexit leader and longtime ally of President Donald Trump, Nigel Farage.

Mr Farage argued that China “has ruined the world in 2020” through its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which it should be forced to pay “very heavy reparations”. Yet, he predicted that with Joe Biden preparing to ascend to the presidency, the CCP will continue its push for global supremacy.

“China’s economy is powering ahead, and its leaders are bullying weaker Western nations,” Farage wrote in Newsweek. Indeed, British newspaper The Times reports Tuesday that the Chinese economy is on track to be the first worldwide to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic.

“With Trump all but gone from the White House, and faltering Joe Biden preparing to move in, it now looks as though China’s quest for world domination is back on track. What a calamity,” Mr Farage lamented.

Mr Farage went on to recall a speech he gave during a Trump campaign rally in Arizona, remarking that the line which resonated with the crowd the most was when he asked the crowd: “Who else among Western leaders has the courage to stand up to the rapacious Chinese Communist Party if not Donald J. Trump?”

“The crowd roared, knowing full well that Biden would not show such strength in the face of the Chinese threat,” Farage said.

Mr Farage said that in the wake of Joe Biden’s apparent victory, China has “wasted no time in trying to reassert its authority over the world”, noting the increasingly tough rhetoric coming from the communist government and state-linked businesses.

He pointed to statements from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian in November, in which he threatened the Five Eyes intelligence alliance of the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, after the bloc criticised the CCP’s move to ban four opposition leaders from the Hong Kong Legislative Council.

Mr Zhao said: “No matter how many ‘eyes’ you have, be careful not to be poked and get blind by harming China’s sovereignty, security and development interests.”

Farage characterised the rhetoric as “the language of a thuggish mafia don,” questioning: “Who would wish to have anything to do with an individual who spoke in such a way?”

The veteran Brexit campaigner went onto decry the veiled threats from Hauwei Vice President Victor Zhang, who said that the UK should reconsider its ban on Huawei equipment from its 5G networks, claiming that the decision was motivated by pressure from the Trump administration during its trade war with China, rather than for security purposes.

The chief technology officer for Huawei, Paul Scanlan also said in November that the company will be seeking a “reset” of relations with the United States and other Western powers under a Biden administration.

Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020

Last week, the Global Times — one of China’s more belligerent state-run mouthpieces — ran an opinion article, in which they told Mr Biden to abandon the “reckless pursuit of the Indo-Pacific strategy” of President Trump and to put a halt to “stirring up the region” by confronting Beijing’s expansionism in the region.

The Chinese Communist paper went on to suggest that Biden accept his “historic responsibility” and to “explore and create an unprecedented win-win situation” in partnership with China”.

While the Biden campaign has paid lip-service to the idea of confronting the CCP, Mr Biden’s pick for National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan has openly advocated for the United States to support the “rise” of China.

“We need to strike a middle course – one that encourages China’s rise in a manner consistent with an open, fair, rules-based, regional order,” Sullivan said in 2017.

The Obama administration alumn went on to argue that for the good of the global economy, a thriving China is critical, though he did say that it was important to determine the “parameters of the system within which China is rising.”

CA Democrat Christy Smith Concedes to Republican Rep. Mike Garcia,['Kristina Wong'],"Democrat candidate California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith conceded to incumbent Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA) Monday in the race for California’s 25th Congressional District — former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA)’s seat before she resigned.

Garcia had a slim lead of just 339 votes, but Smith said it was clear that amount could not be overcome. She wrote on Facebook:

This is not the end result we fought for, but I am proud of the strong, grassroots campaign we ran. Over the last few weeks, our attorneys reviewed thousands of uncounted ballots, and our campaign volunteers undertook an extraordinary effort to cure hundreds of votes throughout the district that otherwise may not have been counted. We exhausted every possible option, and did everything within our power to ensure that every voice in this election was heard. Nonetheless, we came up short.

Garcia, a Navy combat pilot, issued a statement on Monday that said his focus is on representing all constituents in the district.

Garcia said, according to CBSLA.:

My focus is on representing all constituents in CA-25. In the short term, this means pushing to get federal relief to those who are most impacted by COVID, individuals and small businesses. It’s been a tough election, but the fight has been worth it. I am looking forward to two more years. Thank you CA-25!

After a special election in March for Hill’s seat did not produce a candidate with a majority of votes, Smith and Garcia faced a run-off in May. Garcia won and was sworn in. The November 3 race is for a full two-year term.

Garcia called the race an “existential fight” for the nation in an October interview with SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Saturday.

“I’m making sure that what’s happened to our state of California doesn’t happen at the national level. We have some of the highest taxes, thick bureaucracy that’s killing small businesses and making people want to leave California, and there’s a reason for that,” he said.

“A lot of the ills that we’re experiencing here in what should be a very beautiful state, a very thriving state, are now being uploaded to the federal level,” he said.

He also blasted California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA)’s COVID policies that were handcuffing the economy. “We need to get our kids back in school, we need to get our business back online, reopen the amusement parks and start realizing the full potential that we have,” he said.

Garcia, a former Navy pilot, added: “So that’s the fight we’re fighting right now, and people are paying attention.”

"Kentucky AG: Closing Religious Schools Violates First Amendment, ‘We’re Ready’ to Send Lawsuit to SCOTUS",['Ian Hanchett'],"On Monday’s broadcast of the Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends,” Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron (R) stated that he will send his lawsuit arguing that Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear’s (D) school closures violate the First Amendment because they have closed down religious schools to the Supreme Court.

Cameron said that the governor has “repeatedly” infringed on “the First Amendment free exercise of religion here in the commonwealth of Kentucky. Again, I respect his responsibility to keep people safe. But we have to safeguard our religious freedoms here in Kentucky. And so, when you tell folks who send their kids to religious-affiliated schools, which is an act of worship within itself, that they cannot go to school, it infringes upon the First Amendment rights.”

He added, “We won at the federal district court, who said that there was — it was appropriate to issue a statewide injunction because he’d infringed upon First Amendment rights. A panel at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and stayed that injunction. And so, now we’re ready to send our case to the Supreme Court. We’ll be applying for review by the Supreme Court, hopefully, today.”

Stacey Abrams Voter Registration Group Denies Impropriety,['Kyle Morris'],"Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s Republican Secretary of State, resurrected a tired and false claim against the New Georgia Project’s legitimate efforts to register eligible Georgians to participate in elections in a press conference held Monday morning, November 30th.

Nse Ufot, Executive Director of the New Georgia Project said:

As Georgians are turning out in record numbers to have their voices heard at the polls, the Secretary of State is resorting to desperate attempts to smear law-abiding organizations and scare eligible Georgians from registering to vote in critical upcoming elections. We will not be deterred. This attack on our organization comes at a time when people across the country have witnessed the strength of our program and the collective power of a new Georgia electorate that embraces a system of inclusivity and opportunity for all Georgians. The timing is not accidental.

The organization also stated that it will “continue its mission to register eligible voters in advance of the December 7th deadline” in its efforts to make sure that Georgia residents “have their voices heard at the polls and freely and fairly cast their ballots for those who would represent them.”

Raffensperger announced earlier Monday that his office will launch an investigation into voting groups accused of encouraging non-Georgia residents to register to vote in the runoff elections, which are set to take place on January 5.

“We have opened an investigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absentee ballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994,” Raffensperger said during a press conference, adding:

Voting in Georgia when you are not a resident of Georgia is a felony, and encouraging college kids to commit felonies with no regard for what [it] might mean for them is despicable. These third-party groups have a responsibility to not encourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.

Other organizations set to face scrutiny from the investigation include America Votes, Operation New Voter Registration Georgia, and Vote Forward.

Last week, Abrams announced that 900,000 Georgians had requested a mail-in ballot for the runoff elections between Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and her Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock, and another between Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and his Democrat opponent Jon Ossoff.

Interestingly, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Warnock served as the CEO of The New Georgia Project until February of this year.

“Warnock was listed as CEO of the New Georgia Project from 2017 until Feb. 21, 2020, according to the group’s corporate filings,” the report stated. “He has been identified as the New Georgia Project’s chairman and spokesman in media reports and has said he organized voter mobilization drives for the group, including a push to register 80,000 new minority voters in 2014.”",BreitBart,-1
Sarah Fuller’s Halftime Speech Has Some Accusing Vanderbilt of a Publicity Stunt,['Lara Gwinn'],"Vanderbilt senior kicker Sarah Fuller made history on Saturday, becoming the first woman to play on the field in a Power 5 college football game, during the second-half kickoff against the Missouri Tigers. However, recent reports about what happened at halftime before her history-making kick have some believing that her presence on the field may have had more to do with publicity than football.

ESPN reporter Courtney Cronin tweeted on Sunday that she had just ended a Zoom interview with Fuller, where the history-making kicker detailed her halftime locker room speech. “I had coaches come up to me and say ‘I’ve been wanting to say that for awhile now,'” Fuller reportedly said:

""I had coaches come up to me and say 'I’ve been wanting to say that for awhile now,'"" Fuller said. pic.twitter.com/AjoEEjJbeh — Courtney Cronin (@CourtneyRCronin) November 29, 2020

Fuller reportedly said to her new teammates:

If I’m going to be honest, I was a little pissed off at how quiet everybody was on the sideline. … We made a first down, and I was the only one cheering and I was like – what the heck? What’s going on? And I tried to get them pumped up, and I was like, ‘You guys need to start [cheering] your team on.’

My main thing was during the SEC tournament, my entire team was cheering the entire time. It didn’t matter if we were in the locker room or if they were on the sidelines, I think that’s what won it for us. Everybody was cheering non-stop. I just went in there, and I said exactly what I was thinking. I was like, ‘We need to be cheering each other on. This is how you win games. This is how you get better by calling each other out for stuff, and I’m going to call you guys out.’ We need to be supporting one another. If we get a first down, if an interception happens, it’s our fault. We need to be lifting each other up. That’s what a team’s about. I think this team has struggled, and that’s been part of it. We really just need to build that team camaraderie where they can all lean on one another. It was an adjustment going from that team mentality where – hey, we’re all here supporting one another, and I just wanted to bring that to this team.

Some took issue with Fuller’s locker room speech in particular. Joe Kinsey from Outkick questioned Fuller’s and Vanderbilt’s intent:

If you were on the fence about whether Vanderbilt using soccer goalie Sarah Fuller as a fill-in kicker for Saturday’s game against Missouri was a publicity stunt or a necessity, you got your answer on Sunday when it was announced that Fuller had given a halftime speech to her new teammates. Keep in mind, Fuller hadn’t yet stepped foot on the field for her kickoff before giving this speech. … As for this speech, you mean to tell me that a kicker who was pulled off the women’s soccer team and who started practicing with the football team on Tuesday was given the floor to lecture teammates on Saturday?”

“Do you think freshman players on the women’s soccer team who’ve never seen the field get up and give speeches to players who’ve given four years to a program? Nope. Not happening,” Kinsey said.

Responses to Cronin’s tweet also questioned the validity of Vanderbilt’s intentions, with one person saying, “I’m all for her kicking, but this is absurd. Imagine a male walk on kicker of any sort showing up 7 games into the season, not even kicking yet, then lecturing the team about not cheering hard enough bc that’s what they did on his soccer team.”

Another response read, “I mean man or woman, what gives a soccer player who’s been on the team 3 days the RIGHT to stand up and call out players. Imagine being a senior in this locker room. What gives her the authority to do this? Especially a kicker?? Nah.. this ain’t it.”

Others supported Fuller’s place on the team as a needed move for Vanderbilt. Radio host Pat McAfee said, “She was not out asking for this.. An opportunity presented itself,” and that it was not a publicity stunt:

Fuller had a response to her critics during a recent interview. When host Holly Rowe asked Fuller how she handles her critics, Fuller took it in stride, saying, “At this point, like, what are you doing? You know? I am a [Division 1] soccer player. I’m going to Vanderbilt University. I’m getting my degree from here. I’ve done amazing things,” she said:

Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason said on Wednesday, “Right now, we’re just looking at all options. … For us, talking to Sarah, she’s a champ, and no pun intended. Just coming off an SEC Championship in soccer… She’s a complete competitor. She’s an option for us. Right now, that’s where we sit.

“For us, every week is [about] getting to the practice field and about making sure that we put the best possible kicker out there, so we’re competing,” Mason said.

FNC’s Geraldo Rivera: Trump Must Stop Attacking Election Results — ‘Enough Is Enough Now’,['Pam Key'],"Fox News Channel’s Geraldo Rivera called on President Donald Trump to stop attacking the presidential election as fraudulent because it could cost the Republican Party the Georgia Senate races and control of the Senate during an appearance on Monday’s broadcast of “The Story.”

Rivera said, “If people lose faith in Georgia’s electoral system and not show up, then they will be gifting Democrats control of the United States Senate. The stakes are so very high. They are astronomical. You know, as a person who has been accused of giving the president too much of the benefit of the doubt, I can’t imagine why the Republican senators aren’t rallying around the Georgia Republicans – the secretary of state and the governor there – and saying that, ‘The system in Georgia will work. You got to vote. Everything is at stake here.’ Rather than attacking the system, not only in Georgia but nationwide, undermines faith in the system, discourages people.”

He continued, “I think that the president is on the wrong course here. I think he has got to take a real gut check between now and Saturday. With all due respect, and you know I love the guy, but enough is enough now.”

He added, “This is the job he has now as the head of the GOP, as the commander-in-chief of the country – he’s gotta rally the voters in Georgia. Control of the Senate is in the balance now, and if he allows his personal, you know, annoyance with the secretary of state and Governor Kemp to rule, then I think it’s going to be a devastating loss for the Republican Party.”

Raphael Warnock Mocks Churchgoers Having Guns for Self-Defense,['Awr Hawkins'],"A video has emerged showing Democrat Senate candidate Rev. Raphael Warnock mocking churchgoers for wanting to defend themselves with guns.

The video shows Warnock speaking against the Safe Carry Protection Act, which Georgia lawmakers enacted in 2014. The act expanded the number of places law-abiding citizens could carry guns for self-defense in the hopes of reducing the number of gun-free zones, thereby reducing the number of soft targets available to criminals and/or demented attackers.

The video, posted by the NRA, shows Warnock saying, “Somebody decided that they had a bright idea to pass a piece of legislation that will allow for guns and concealed weapons to be carried in churches.”

He went on to mock the idea of carrying a gun in a church meeting, suggesting such meetings are the “last place” where carrying a firearm ought to be allowed.

On November 5, 2017, Stephen Willeford’s daughter told him she heard gun shots at the nearby First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Willeford grabbed an AR-15 and ran to the scene, making contact with the attacker, then shooting and wounding him to stop the attack.

The heinous attack that brought Willeford running resulted in a Texas law allowing concealed carry permit holders to be armed in their churches and houses of worship for self-defense.

The law allowing self-defense carry in churches took effect in September 2019 and just months later, on December 29, 2019, an armed church member, who was also a volunteer church security team member, took out an armed attacker and saved countless lives. Because Jack Wilson was armed and ready, the attacker sustained a lethal bullet wound immediately after he shot and killed an innocent.

Surveillance video of the December 29, 2019, attack shows the attacker pull a shotgun out from his jacket, only to be killed within seconds by Wilson. As the video rolls, other armed congregants can be seen rising from their seats and converging on the attacker’s position:

The Safe Carry Protection Act was designed to give Georgians the kind of fighting chance that the world saw on display when Wilson shot the attacker in the White Settlement, Texas, church. But Warnock mocked the idea of churchgoers being armed for defense of themselves and others.

Biden's Top Economic Adviser Tied to Delphi Pension-Slashing Scheme,['John Binder'],"Democrat Joe Biden’s pick to be his top economic adviser in the White House served on the Obama-appointed team that helped slash pensions for roughly 20,000 Americans in the auto bailout.

This week, Biden announced that Obama alum Brian Deese, now an executive at the investment management firm BlackRock, will serve as his top economic adviser should he enter the White House.

Deese previously served as a special assistant to Obama for economic policy and played a role in the administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which ultimately led to slashed pensions for 20,000 non-union workers at the Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier to General Motors (GM).

In 2009, as part of the Obama-Biden administration’s taxpayer-funded bailout of GM, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) terminated the pension plans of non-unionized Delphi workers. In some cases, workers had their pensions gutted by as much as 75 percent.

A federal report in 2013 detailed that the Delphi workers would likely have their pensions cut by an estimated $440 million. Meanwhile, GM topped off unionized Delphi workers’ pensions at a cost of about $1 billion.

Deese, along with agency heads like Timothy Geithner and top advisers like Ron Bloom, was named in that federal report, having had been involved in multiple conversations about the Delphi pensions:

In July 2009, internal Government emails between the Auto Team and Advisor to the President Brian Deese discussed GM’s need to address issues with Delphi’s “splinter unions.” Auto Team officials did not recall details related to the emails. When Senator Charles Schumer took a position that GM should assume the Delphi salaried retiree pensions, Mr. Deese emailed Mr. Rattner this “may complicate the optics of doing anything for the splinters.” Other emails from Mr. Deese stated, “We will continue to face intense scrutiny on this issue. The politics of terminations is quite intense” and “we need to work on a clear rationale for the outcomes we’re moving toward, as well as an explanation of respective roles.” Mr. Rattner emailed members of the Auto Team that he had spoken with Fritz Henderson about “our logic on the splinters, which he [Henderson] was fine with. [Auto Team Analyst] Sadiq [Malik] should speak to Janice [Uhlig] about the details, particularly how the reallocation of the $417mm would work.” Auto Team member Feldman emailed members of the Auto Team about health care/pension benefit changes for IUE and USW employees, and Mr. Deese responded that the company’s organizing principle was parity between GM salaried and non-UAW hourlies. Mr. Deese referenced a discussion about health care costs and the “credible fairness arguments to augment the hourlies’ recovery based on the pension disparity, but that for all the reasons we discussed that would not be possible. However, I think the logic of that conclusion strongly counsels in favor of bringing the top-up through. Otherwise, we’re moving in the opposite direction from a position that we all agreed was itself on the edge of fairness.”

In October, President Trump signed a memorandum to devise a plan to restore the pensions of the Delphi workers. Biden has not said if he supports the memorandum.

Former Delphi workers told Breitbart News in interviews how the pension-slashing scheme uprooted their livelihoods. One retiree said she lost her home, and her retirement plans to move to the Florida coast have been squashed.

Another retiree said his wife died in the process, as he was forced to find work in order to pay for her medical bills. He had assumed that after 30 years at Delphi, he and his wife would have a good healthcare plan in their retirement. That ended when his pension was cut by about 30 percent.

Delphi, which has since split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies, announced in 2006 that it would shutter 21 of its 29 plants in the United States — offshoring some 20,000 U.S. jobs to Mexico, China, and other foreign countries.

At the time, Delphi employed nearly 50,000 Americans, who earned about $30 an hour on the assembly line. Now, workers in Mexico for the company earn about $1 an hour.

Global Smartphone Sales Drop 5.7 Percent in Q3 2020,['Tom Ciccotta'],"A new report published this week revealed that global smartphone sales dropped almost six percent during the third quarter of 2020. During the same period, Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi passed Apple to become the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.

According to a report by Gartner, global smartphone sales dropped by nearly six percent in the third quarter of 2020.

Anshul Gupta, a senior researcher at Gartner, argues that the decrease in smartphone sales was likely caused by coronavirus lockdowns, which have forced many consumers to limit their spending.

“Consumers are limiting their discretionary spend even as some lockdown conditions have started to improve,” Gupta said. “Global smartphone sales experienced moderate growth from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter. This was due to pent-up demand from previous quarters.”

“Early signs of recovery can be seen in a few markets, including parts of mature Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Near normal conditions in China improved smartphone production to fill in the supply gap in the third quarter which benefited sales to some extent,” Gupta added. “For the first time this year, smartphone sales to end users in three of the top five markets i.e., India, Indonesia and Brazil increased, growing 9.3%, 8.5% and 3.3%, respectively.”

The report also revealed that Apple now trails Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi with regards to market share in the smartphone industry. Previously, Apple occupied the third spot on the list. It was surpassed in the third quarter by Xiaomi, due in part to the delayed shipment of iPhone 12 models.

Breitbart News reported this week on a rumor that Apple may remove the charging port from next year’s line of iPhones. The Silicon Valley giant faced criticism when it removed the headphone port from its smartphones in 2016.

Christopher Columbus Expert ‘Appalled’ by Notre Dame’s Censorship of Murals Featuring Explorer,['Tom Ciccotta'],"The University of Notre Dame announced over the summer that it would cover 12 murals of Christopher Columbus with tapestries inspired by Native American artwork. Now former Stanford professor Carol Delaney, who wrote a book examining Christopher Columbus’ legacy, is speaking out. Delaney says she is “appalled” by Notre Dame’s censorship, claiming Columbus is “not the man” social justice activists claim.

According to a report by Campus Reform, a retired Stanford professor is pushing back this week against the University of Notre Dame’s effort to cover up murals of Christopher Columbus. The murals were covered up by tapestries in the style of Native American artwork as part of a larger effort by the university to reexamine popular narratives about Christopher Columbus.

Activists have pushed to replace Columbus day for some time. Breitbart News reported in September that officials in Baltimore pushed to replace a monument to Columbus with a “police violence victims” monument.

The Notre Dame murals were painted by Vatican painter Luigi Gregori in the university’s main building between 1882 and 1884. In August, they were completely covered by tapestries that hang over the historic murals.

Last week, Delaney, who authored a book titled, Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem: How Religion Drove the Voyages that Led to America, told Campus Reform that the university’s decision to “I am appalled at what Notre Dame is doing,” Delaney said. “Instead they [Columbus’ detractors] need to learn more about Columbus.. he is not the man they think he is…and also why not have two murals!”

The university explains on its website that the decision to cover the mural prompted a conversation on campus about Columbus’ legacy.

In autumn of 2020, the Christopher Columbus murals of 1882-1884 by the Vatican-based painter Luigi Gregori in the University’s Main Building were covered with removable tapestries. This followed an intensive period of discussion, research and reflection across the Notre Dame and regional communities on how best to address a complex narrative that was considered celebratory in the late 19th century but that many found troubling by the early 21st century –- especially in its depiction of Native Americans.

Tesla Will Be Added to S&P 500 in December,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 index on December 21 in a single step despite concerns that the move could impact the U.S. stock market. Tesla CEO Elon Musk made $100 billion in 2020 alone, making him the world’s second-richest man.

According to a report by CNBC, Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 on December 21 in a single step despite concerns that such a move could disrupt the stock market. Tesla, which is valued at $500 billion, is the largest company to ever be added to the S&P 500 index.

Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that the S&P 500 spoke with members of the investment community prior to its decision to add Tesla in a single step.

“The fact that when S&P originally made the announcement they sought feedback from the investment community on how to handle the addition tells you all you need to know to show how unique a situation this is,” Hickey said.

In a statement, S&P Dow Jones Indices said that the decision to add Tesla to the index in this manner was based on a comprehensive overview of the feedback it received from investors.

“In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market’s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,”

The Associated Press reported on Monday that November marked the S&P 500’s best month since April. The stock market surged in November on news about the successful development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

Elon Musk’s personal fortune increased by a whopping $100 billion in 2020, moving him past Bill Gates to become the world’s second-richest man behind Jeff Bezos.

No Twitter ‘Fact Check’ Warning on Chinese Official’s Fake Photo of Australian Soldier Beheading Child,['Simon Kent'],"Twitter on Tuesday rejected Canberra’s calls to remove a Beijing official’s gruesome tweet targeting Australian troops, choosing instead to stand with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As Breitbart News reported, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded Beijing apologize after a top CCP official posted an obviously contrived image on Twitter depicting an Australian soldier with his knife to a child’s throat, appearing to prepare to behead the victim.

Morrison described the post by the official Twitter account of Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as an “outrageous and disgusting slur” at a virtual news conference in Canberra on Monday.

Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, &call for holding them accountable. pic.twitter.com/GYOaucoL5D — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) November 30, 2020

AFP reports Twitter said it had since marked the tweet as “sensitive,” but added comments on topical political issues or “foreign policy sabre-rattling” by official government accounts were generally not in violation of its rules.

Twitter is banned for most citizens in China and Beijing has for decades been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

Some Australian allies expressed concern over the tweet, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with the support coming as Australia looks to strengthen its alliances in the Indo/Pacific region as a guard against Beijing’s increasingly strident diplomacy.

“In this case an image has been used that is not factually correct, that is not a genuine image, so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities,” she told reporters.

The French foreign affairs ministry said the post was “unworthy of the diplomatic standards we have the right to expect from a country like China”.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra dismissed the criticism, instead accusing Australia of making too much of the incident.

“The rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr. Zhao’s tweet,” the spokesperson said.

﻿

The embassy suggested Australian officials were attempting to “deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers” and “stoke domestic nationalism.”

"Bitcoin Surges over $19,900 Value, Beats All-Time Record Set in 2017",['Ezra Dulis'],"Bitcoin reached an all-time-high price against the U.S. dollar Monday morning, besting a record set nearly three years ago.

The digital, decentralized, deflationary asset (BTC) sold for $19,850.11 shortly after 10 AM EST, according to Coindesk data. Its previous high was set on December 17, 2017 at around $19,783. It began trading that year below $1,000 but began smashing records in the summer, fueled by intense interest from retail investors, many of whom were taken in by a Ponzi scheme called BitConnect.

UPDATE: This new record has already been broken. According to Coindesk, BTC traded at $19,920.53 Tuesday morning shortly after 6 AM EST.

After several years of correction to that parabolic bull run, Bitcoin markets have seen high volatility in 2020 — starting the year around $7,000, crashing below $5,000 at the time of the stock market’s massive coronavirus selloff, then seeing an uptick in institutional investment after its “halving” — a software feature which periodically cuts the growth rate of its monetary supply by half.

Less than two weeks ago, BTC’s market capitalization hit an all-time high; on November 19, it reached a unit price of about $18,400 that, with more than one million new Bitcoins in circulation, surpassed the network’s overall value seen during its 2017 euphoric rise.

Bitcoin’s 2020 bull run has been fueled less by everyday investors and more by financial institutions, with firms such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust leading the charge. In late October, PayPal (which also owns Venmo) announced it would begin integrating Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies. Pantera Capital, another investment firm dedicated to Bitcoin and its imitators, estimates that PayPal and Jack Dorsey’s Square (the owner of Cash App, a popular Bitcoin purchase on-ramp) are buying up BTC faster than it is being created, or “mined.”",BreitBart,-1
American Airlines to Fly 737 Max Test Flights Carrying Only Employees,['Tom Ciccotta'],"American Airlines announced over the weekend that it will charter five flights on the infamous Boeing 737 Max carrying only its own employees as part of a trial program. The FAA approved the fleet for a return to the airways in November following a 20-month hiatus that occurred after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

According to a report by View From The Wing, American Airlines is the first airline to announce that they will run test flights with Boeing’s 737 Max fleet to ensure their safety. The fleet was grounded by aviation authorities around the globe after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

American Airlines announced in a statement that it will be flying five 737 Max flights without commercial passengers prior to their official reintroduction into the airline’s aircraft inventory.

“We know that restoring our customers’ confidence in the 737 MAX starts with ensuring our own team members are comfortable,” the statement reads. “That’s why, leading up to the aircraft’s return to scheduled service Dec. 29, we’ll operate five 737 MAX flights, exclusively for team members.”

The flights are scheduled to take place between December 3 and December 17. The test flights will depart from Dallas, Miami, and New York City’s LaGuardia airport. Pilots will be required to participate in simulator training at facilities in Dallas and Miami. The training will reportedly simulate various scenarios, including the MCAS system failure that led to the two fatal crashes.

American Airlines also announced that they intend to have all of their pilots trained on the operation and safety features of the refreshed 737 Max fleet by the end of March 2021.

Breitbart News reported this month that multiple airlines will allow their customers to reschedule flights with no charge if they are uncomfortable flying on the 737 Max.",BreitBart,-1
PolitiFact Admits Bogus Facebook Fact Check After Candace Owens Challenges ‘False’ Rating,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Facebook “fact-checker” PolitiFact was forced to issue a correction after conservative commentator Candace Owens challenged the “false” rating tacked on to a recent video she posted about former Vice President Joe Biden.

“Correction: PolitiFact originally labeled this video false in our capacity as a third-party fact-checker for Facebook,” PolitiFact announced last week.

“On Nov. 20, an appeal to that decision was made on behalf of Ms. Owens. PolitiFact approved the appeal on Nov. 20, determined that a correction was appropriate, and removed the false rating,” the statement added.

“Anybody who understands politics, who passed a basic level of civics knows that right now, in this moment, Joe Biden is literally and legally not the president-elect,” said Owens in her video that was falsely “fact-checked” by PolitiFact.

“This information cannot be fact-checked, because that is the truth, so they cannot take that off, they cannot censor that. It is a fact,” continued Owens in her video.

In August, Owens announced that she would be suing Facebook over its “blatant censorship” after the social media platform demonetized her page following her comments about senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) swearing into congress in 2017 as an “Indian-American.”

“I am SO EXCITED that we get to watch [Kamala Harris], who swore into congress as an ‘Indian-American’, now play the ‘I’m a black a woman’ card all the way until November,” Owens had quipped on social media. “Fun times!”

At the time, Owens told Breitbart News that Big Tech “censorship issue is real and we haven’t done enough to fight it as conservatives.”

“All they [fact checkers] have to do is find one opposite opinion, and they can give you a false rating,” Owens explained. “You have to send a legal letter every time to get it reversed.”

Owens took to Twitter on Saturday to celebrate her first victory in the case against the social media giant.

“Weeks ago, @Facebook censored a post of mine which truthfully stated that @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect. So I got lawyers involved. Conclusion? @PolitiFact uncensored the post & admitted that they LIED by rating my post false. The fact-checkers are lying for Democrats,” tweeted Owens.

At 8 Months pregnant, I unfortunately cannot fight on the ground alongside patriots like I am used to, but I am taking every measure to fight these communists in the court room. It is my goal to expose these lying “fact-checkers” one by one. @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect. pic.twitter.com/hW4NLpK4tc — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) November 28, 2020

“At 8 Months pregnant, I unfortunately cannot fight on the ground alongside patriots like I am used to, but I am taking every measure to fight these communists in the court room,” she added. “It is my goal to expose these lying ‘fact-checkers’ one by one. @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect.”

Owens also said that she has retained lawyers, including attorney Todd McMurtry, who was on the legal team representing former Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann.

“It is time to fact-check the fact-checkers,” said Owens. “I’m going to put these suckers through discovery and figure out what the relationship is that they have with Facebook.”

The conservative firebrand added that she has also launched a website called “Fact-Check Zuck,” which people can visit to help support her legal efforts in taking on Facebook’s fact-checkers.

“Our freedoms are being stripped away. The overlords of Big Tech are determining what Americans can and cannot say, share, like, and post,” the site reads. “Support our legal efforts today as we fight back against Facebook’s fact-checkers, confronting those who are suppressing free speech, thought, and expression across our great country.”

Wikipedia Blacklists Newsmax Following Post-Election Popularity Boost,['T.D. Adler'],"Newsmax has seen growing audiences at its online and televised news platforms since the disputed 2020 Presidential election amid President Donald Trump’s criticism of other conservative media coverage. After a Wikipedia editor suggested having the outlet treated as reliable, other editors responded by having Newsmax banned from use as a source for factual claims instead, partly citing its coverage of election fraud allegations, making it the latest conservative outlet banned on Wikipedia in an ongoing purge.

Audience growth for Newsmax accelerated this month as conservative media audiences turn against more establishment organs such as Fox News over their coverage of the disputed nature of the 2020 election. Fox and other establishment outlets called the election for former Vice President Joe Biden even as President Donald Trump’s campaign pursues legal challenges over alleged voting improprieties. Trump has responded by attacking Fox and encouraging a switch to Newsmax or One America News. As Newsmax seeks to capitalize on this interest, Fox reportedly has sought to stifle them by blacklisting guests who appear on the competitor.

Due to the recent surge in popularity, one editor started a discussion arguing Newsmax’s reliability should be upgraded from its then-unclear status. Within minutes an editor responded with an inflammatory rant and instead called for Newsmax to be “deprecated” as a source, referring to outlets prohibited from use as sources for factual claims. The only cited evidence for Newsmax being unreliable was a report by the left-wing Media Matters group about a Newsmax-associated newsletter that inadvertently published anti-vaccine marketing material in an e-mail to subscribers.

Shortly afterward, editor Paul Lee also called for banning Newsmax as a source. Lee has regularly participated in discussions pushing for bans on conservative media outlets and is also the primary author of the article on the Steele dossier, which informed the debunked hoax claiming Trump colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 election, where material is slanted in favor of treating the discredited document as reliable. As more mostly left-wing editors weighed in to call for a ban over the following hours, the discussion was changed to a formal ban discussion.

Editors “Aquillion” and “MastCell” made the most influential comments calling for banning Newsmax. Both editors are known for advancing left-wing agendas on Wikipedia, MastCell being an administrator with special privileges on the site. In each of their comments, they cited studies and reports they claimed showed “reliable” sources considered Newsmax to be an egregiously unreliable source. Under Wikipedia’s reliable sourcing and verifiability policies, the quality of any source is generally judged based on what competing sources report about it.

One study they both cited mentioned Newsmax spreading a claim later found to be false, but the study also noted outlets considered reliable on Wikipedia, such as BuzzFeed News and the left-wing New Republic, had spread the claim. Another study they each cited credited Newsmax with popularizing the term “anchor baby” in political discourse about immigration, but there was no suggestion the outlet reported anything inaccurate. They each also cited a study listing Newsmax as a “junk news source” yet the study labeled Mediaite and New York Daily News the same way, both sources considered reliable on Wikipedia.

Aquillion separately cited a study calling Newsmax a “misinformation source” yet the study also labeled Huffington Post one as well, though the outlet is considered generally reliable on Wikipedia save mixed views on its politics coverage. MastCell cited news articles from CNN and the left-wing Guardian reporting Newsmax’s willingness to cover election fraud claims, but CNN never accused Newsmax of reporting false information and the Guardian only criticized a host’s opinion commentary for minor inaccuracies. Wall Street Journal coverage of a distribution network displaying Russian state-owned RT articles on Newsmax web pages was also cited, though the RT articles were not republished content and Newsmax was unaware RT was included.

MastCell also cited a Daily Beast article reporting Newsmax was one of several outlets that included opinion pieces from a network of fabricated individuals who backed the agenda of the United Arab Emirates. As with other cases, outlets considered reliable on Wikipedia such as the Jerusalem Post and South China Morning Post, were also fooled by the network. The same article was cited to support declaring the Post-Millennial unreliable, alongside false smears from Antifa of Andy Ngo, an editor for the outlet.

In the ban discussion, editors eagerly cited MastCell and Aquillion’s votes in support of their own. However, several editors pointed out the various flaws with the sources they cited, including one editor who still voted to declare Newsmax unreliable. Some editors did also vote for treating the outlet as reliable, while others challenged ban arguments without voting. Despite the issues with ban arguments, predominantly left-wing editors supporting Newsmax being banned from use as a source for factual claims overwhelmed the discussion and it was closed in favor of a ban in just over a week.

Contrasted with the treatment of the Newsmax discussion, which was closed in an accelerated procedure as most such discussions stay open a month, more left-leaning outlets such as CNN and MSNBC have had discussions about merely discouraging their use for political content shut down within a day in favor of the outlets even as editors began presenting evidence of past misconduct. Those discussions came after Fox News was discouraged as a source for political content.

Wikipedia sourcing policies have been routinely used against conservative media with Breitbart News among outlets subjected to a similar ban as Newsmax. Site owners often praise the decisions, alongside corporate media, as countering “fake news” online in keeping with a strategy proposed to Wikipedia’s owners by a public relations firm run by the Clinton Foundation’s Head of Communications. This has led to Wikipedia being relied on by Big Tech. Analyses of Wikipedia sourcing show the site’s top sources are often left-wing media and American politician articles mostly used left-wing sources. Other studies and analyses further corroborate Wikipedia’s left-wing bias, which has been criticized by the site’s own co-founder and includes supporting Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the Biden campaign.

Report: Apple May Remove the iPhone’s Charging Port,['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report states that following Apple’s iPhone 12 naming standards, it’s possible that the company’s iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max phones may not feature a charging port whatsoever.

CNET reports that tech industry rumors suggest that tech giant Apple is planning to kill its proprietary Lightning Port on future iPhones, favoring a completely portless design. One recent indication that this may be the case is the introduction of Apple’s MagSafe charger on the iPhone 12.

The MagSafe wireless charging system uses an embedded array of magnets in a puck that snaps onto the iPhone 12. To charge the iPhone 12, place it on the circular charging pad and wait for the charging indicator on the screen to confirm that it is connected. This eliminates the need for a Lightning charging cable.

CNET claims that with the addition of the MagSafe charger, a wireless future for the iPhone seems inevitable and offers a glimpse into Apple’s vision of a cord-free iPhone accessory ecosystem. Tuong Huy Nguyen, a senior principal analyst at Gartner, commented: “Wireless technologies have reached a level of maturity where a portless device is much more viable than it’s ever been.”

Apple has been pushing for wireless alternatives for certain functions for some time. The company introduced AirDrop and cloud for data transferring and released its wireless earbuds, the Apple AirPods, in 2016.

Research Manager Will Wong at IDC’s Asia Pacific commented: “A smartphone is a device with limited space for all the components, but it will also be important for the smartphone makers to provide better or more functions to stay competitive. Thus, a portless phone is likely to be an unavoidable trend.”

Report: Activists Cheer as Tech Workers Flee San Francisco,['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report from NBC News suggests that many residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are happy to see the tech giants that made the area so popular move to cities such as Denver, Colorado, and Austin, Texas.

NBC News reports in an article titled “‘Good riddance’: Tech’s flight from San Francisco is a relief to some advocates,” that not everyone living in the San Francisco area is a huge fan of the Silicon Valley tech giants that have operated in the region for years.

The article focuses on Chirag Bhakta, a San Francisco native and tenant organizer for the affordable house nonprofit Mission Housing. When he heard that many tech firms were leaving the area, his response was “good riddance.”

NBC News writes:

He [Bhakta] said the sudden departure of many tech workers and executives — often to less expensive, rural areas where they can telecommute during the coronavirus pandemic — reveals that their relationship with San Francisco was “transactional” all along. “They used their capital to radically shift the makeup of poor, working-class communities,” Bhakta said. “We’re left with ‘for sale’ signs and price points that are still out of reach for most people.” Many urban centers have seen residents move out in large numbers since the start of stay-at-home orders in March, but the shift has been especiallydramatic for San Francisco, a city that was already experiencing rapid change because of the tech industry. Software engineers, CEOs and venture capitalists have chosen to jump from the Bay Area to places such as Denver, Miami and Austin, Texas, citing housing costs, California’s relatively high income tax and the Bay Area’s general resistance to rapid growth and change.

John Elberling, executive director of Todco, an affordable housing nonprofit that operates in the South of Market neighborhood, commented: “The motivation got to this get-rich-quick attitude. And that isn’t what our city is about. You can make a lot of money here, obviously, but that’s not the persona of San Francisco.” He added: “If all you care about is money, I suggest you go to Texas.”

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Announces Plans to Step Down in January,['Allum Bokhari'],"Ajit Pai, chairman of the FCC, has announced he will step down from the position on January 20, 2021.

Pai was appointed chairman of the FCC by President Trump in 2017. His most high-profile decision, ending Obama’s Title II restrictions on internet service providers (misleadingly branded “net neutrality” by Democrats), led to wild predictions from liberals and activist groups about the end of the “internet as we know it.” These predictions did not come to pass.

Pai frequently criticized leftist Big Tech platforms for eroding free speech on the internet, and was preparing to move forward on President Trump’s executive order on social media censorship. With Pai now stepping down in January, this process is unlikely to continue.

In a statement, Pai said:

It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve at the Federal Communications Commission, including as Chairman of the FCC over the past four years. I am grateful to President Trump for giving me the opportunity to lead the agency in 2017, to President Obama for appointing me as a Commissioner in 2012, and to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the Senate for twice confirming me. To be the first Asian-American to chair the FCC has been a particular privilege. As I often say: only in America. I also deeply appreciate the chance to have worked alongside the FCC’s talented staff. They are the agency’s best assets, and they have performed heroically, especially during the pandemic. It’s also been an honor to work with my fellow Commissioners to execute a strong and broad agenda. Together, we’ve delivered for the American people over the past four years: closing the digital divide; promoting innovation and competition, from 5G on the ground to broadband from space; protecting consumers; and advancing public safety. And this FCC has not shied away from making tough choices. As a result, our nation’s communications networks are now faster, stronger, and more widely deployed than ever before. I am proud of how productive this Commission has been, from commencing five spectrum auctions and two rural broadband reverse auctions in four years, to opening 1,245 megahertz of mid-band spectrum for unlicensed use, to adopting more than 25 orders through our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, to aggressively protecting our communications networks from national security threats at home and abroad, to designating 988 as the three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and much, much more. I’m also proud of the reforms we have instituted to make the agency more accountable to the American people. In particular, for the first time ever, we’ve made public drafts of the proposals and orders slated for a vote three weeks before the agency’s monthly meetings, making this the most transparent FCC in history. Last but not least, I want to thank my family for all they have done to enable me to serve at the agency. The public service of one generally results from the private sacrifice of many, and I’m grateful for their love and support.

Breitbart News will continue to report on the FCC and free speech online.

Pennsylvania Elementary School Principal Claims She Was Fired over Conservative Facebook Memes,['Tom Ciccotta'],"An elementary school principal in Pennsylvania claims she was fired over a series of conservative Facebook posts. Amy Sacks was removed in July from her position as principal of Evergreen Elementary School in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. According to her lawyer, “Like millions of Americans over the last year Amy posted political memes opposing Joe Biden and other Democrats, while supporting the police and Republican candidates, on her private Facebook account.”

According to a report by the College Fix, former Evergreen Elementary School Principal Amy Sacks was terminated from her position after one of her Facebook posts was criticized by a member of the community. Now, Sacks is suing her former employer, alleging a violation of her First Amendment rights.

“Due to Covid, we’re gonna need people to riot from home and destroy your own shit,” one of Sacks’ posts read. Another meme posted by Sacks suggested that congressional leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are “professional looters.”

Sacks says that the district’s superintendent eventually told her that she was terminated because her Facebook posts were “offensive, unacceptable, “unprofessional,” and “racist.” The superintendent said that she had been made aware of Sacks’ Facebook posts after being notified by an angry parent.

In a statement, Sacks’ attorney Frances Malofiy argued that Sacks was unlawfully terminated from her position over her conservative views. Malofiy claims that the district’s decision to fire Sacks was a violation of the First Amendment.

“Like millions of Americans over the last year Amy posted political memes opposing Joe Biden and other Democrats, while supporting the police and Republican candidates, on her private Facebook account,” the statement reads. “As a public employee, Dr. Sacks’ private expression is protected by the First Amendment, and also by Board Policies 320 and 321 which encourage employees to privately participate in politics and civics.”

UK Moves up Ban on Huawei Equipment Installations to Next Year,['Breitbart London'],"LONDON (AP) – Wireless carriers in the U.K. won’t be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks after September 2021, the British government said Monday, hardening its line against the Chinese technology company.

The deadline is part of a roadmap the British government is laying down to remove “high risk” equipment suppliers with draft legislation that aims to tighten telecommunications security requirements.

The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain´s next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China´s communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.

Telecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company´s existing gear out of their systems.

While the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly – making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.

Boris Johnson Should ‘Reconsider’ Huawei Ban Following Trump ‘Defeat’, Threatens Chinese Tech Giant https://t.co/n39DQPl7XK — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 17, 2020

Huawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain´s ban was politically motivated.

“Today I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high-risk vendors from our 5G networks,” Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. “This will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.”

The Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don´t comply with the rules.

The government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities.

Amazon Joins Your Alexa Devices Together with Your Neighbors in a ‘Shared Network’ HIvemind,['Lucas Nolan'],"E-commerce giant Amazon is facing a privacy backlash over its new “Sidewalk” feature which joins together Alexa-powered smart devices within your home with those belonging to neighbors. The company claims the “shared network” will help “devices work better.” One cybersecurity expert called Amazon’s new service “deeply problematic from a privacy perspective,” noting that “No one rides on my WiFi for free, especially a giant corporation with billions of dollars.”

MSN reports that e-commerce giant Amazon is facing backlash for its new Sidewalk feature which automatically turns Alexa-powered smart devices into shared networks. Amazon customers are automatically entered into the Sidewalk program which will connect Alex devices to other nearby devices, even those owned by someone else. Users can disable the feature from their Alexa app.

The Sidewalk program uses Alexa devices including Echo and Ring video doorbells to create a “shared network” aimed at helping “devices work better.” Amazon told users in a recent email that the program allows nearby devices to use a portion of a neighbor’s WiFi bandwidth so devices can have more range.

On a launch page, Amazon stated: “These Bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth which is pooled together to provide these services to you and your neighbors. And when more neighbors participate, the network becomes even stronger.”

Amazon also published a research paper detailing the technology behind Sidewalk in anticipation of privacy concerns. The paper includes the steps taken by Amazon to keep users’ data private and concluded that privacy was one of the “foundational principles” of Sidewalk’s design.

The report’s authors stated: “By sharing a small portion of their home network bandwidth, neighbors give a little – but get a lot in return.” However, many are skeptical as to whether a network system such as Sidewalk could realistically keep user data private.

Alan Woodward, a professor at the University of Surrey specializing in cybersecurity, told BBC News in an interview that Sidewalk should be an opt-in feature rather than an opt-out feature as it currently is, adding, “It feels wrong not knowing what your device is connected to.”

The chief information security officer at Cyjax, Ian Thornton-Trump, told Forbes that the launch was “deeply problematic from a privacy perspective.” He added: “The ‘on by default’ approach is not consumer-friendly. No one rides on my WiFi for free, especially a giant corporation with billions of dollars.”

An Amazon representative confirmed in a statement that the program was automatically enabled for existing customers, stating: “But well before Sidewalk launches, we will notify existing customers with eligible Bridge devices so they can consider the benefits of Sidewalk before deciding if they want to change their preferences.

New Jersey Lawmakers Pass Bill to Adopt ‘Social Justice’ Education in Public Schools,['Tom Ciccotta'],"The New Jersey state legislature recently passed a bill that will install a new “racism” and “social justice” education program for students enrolled at public schools in the state. The bill will become law if it is signed by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D).

According to a report by the College Fix, a bill that was recently passed by the New Jersey state legislature may result in the adoption of state-wide educational programming on racism and social justice. The bill was drafted to supplement an existing state law that requires public schools to incorporate black history into their lesson plans.

New Jersey Assemblywoman Angela McKnight, a sponsor of the bill, said that the bill will ensure that students in the state are taught a more complete version of black history.

“Our children will learn about Black history and not just being a slave,” McKnight said. “We will know the contributions that Black people continue to do.”

One school district in the state is taking the issue into its own hands. The Cherry Hill School District announced recently that it may become the first district in the state to require students to take a black history course prior to graduation. The proposal was first introduced by students associated with the Black Lives Matter movement earlier this year. The district is reportedly working with historians from Stockton University and the University of Pennsylvania on the development of the course.

12-year-old student Ebele Azikiwe, who runs a youth organization called Rise Against Hate, told lawmakers that the proposed bill could help ease social conflict in the United States.

“There is so much to share, to help awaken people,” Azikwe said. “If people were taught early we aren’t a threat but simply human it will make a huge difference.”",BreitBart,-1
British Anti-Terrorism Army Unit Targeting Anti Vaccine Content Online,['Kurt Zindulka'],"A British army “information warfare” unit has been tasked with countering so-called anti-vaccine disinformation as the UK prepares to roll out millions of vaccines.

The Defence Cultural Specialist Unit (DCSU) of the army’s 77th Brigade was founded in 2010 as a part of the UK’s efforts to combat radical Islamic propaganda during the war in Afghanistan. The unit specialises in “building an understanding of the physical, virtual and cognitive behaviours of audiences, actors and adversaries.”

Leaked documents that were reported on by The Times reveal that the secretive unit, which previously targetted al-Qaeda and the Taliban, has been tasking soldiers with monitoring the internet for coronavirus ‘propaganda’ as well as the effects it is supposedly having on the minds of the British public.

A retired army brigadier, Ben Barry, who now serves on the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, told the paper that the army would likely see an increased role in fighting against coronavirus misinformation over the coming months.

The documents also revealed that starting from next month, the 77th Brigade is expected to launch an “uplift” programme to recruit current and reserve soldiers to join the infowar operations of the DCSU.

A spokesman from the Cabinet Office said: “As we edge closer to a vaccine we continue to work closely with social media companies and other organisations to anticipate and mitigate any emerging anti-vax narratives and promote authoritative sources of information.”

The Ministry of Defence denied that the counter-terrorism unit was being used to target the British public, claiming that their operations were “not being directed at the UK population; 77th Brigade do not, and have never, conducted any kind of action against British citizens”.

Report: National Health Service Will Use 'Sensible' Celebrities to Front Vaccines Campaign https://t.co/U1ED8lPW3i — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 30, 2020

The British government is expecting to approve coronavirus vaccines by as early as this week, with injections of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech projected to start as soon as December 2.

To coincide with the jab rollout, the government is also expected to launch a propaganda push to convince Britons to take up the vacine. The campaign will also include a ‘counter-disinformation’ push led by the Cabinet Office in conjunction with the army and the GCHQ intelligence service.

Boris Johnson’s Conservative-led government has already been flagging supposed fake news about coronavirus vaccines for removal to Silicon Valley tech companies, however, there have been calls from the left-wing Labour Party to criminalise ‘conspiracy theory’ posts about vaccines.

The government has so far refused to rule out making the coronavirus vaccines mandatory, yet, they are reportedly considering introducing ‘vaccine stamps‘ in passports for international travel as well as ‘freedom passes‘ for people to go about their daily lives with fewer restrictions.

Former Coinbase Employees Claim Discrimination After CEO Blasts Woke Capitalism,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Former employees of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase told the New York Times that they experienced racist and discriminatory treatment during their time with the company. The report comes just weeks following the adoption of a company policy that prohibited discussion of politics at the workplace. CEO Brian Armstrong said at the time, “We don’t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission.”

According to a report by the New York Times, former employees at Coinbase are speaking out against an alleged pattern of discrimination at the company. Coinbase was founded in 2012 to serve as an exchange for emerging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The platform has since expanded to several other cryptocurrencies.

In 2018 and 2019, 15 black employees at the company reportedly complained about a pattern of racism and discrimination at the company. Alysa Butler, who resigned from Coinbase in 2019, suggested that Coinbase is worse than any other Silicon Valley company when it comes to “diversity.”

“Most people of color working in tech know that there’s a diversity problem,” Butler said. “But I’ve never experienced anything like Coinbase.”

Ruby Bhattacharya, a former recruiter for Coinbase, claims that her former colleagues ostracized her over her sexuality and race. “I was told I don’t have the right brain for this,” she said. “It was constant condescension.”

Breitbart News reported in October that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told employees that they would not be permitted to discuss politics at the workplace. Armstrong was criticized for the policy by progressive leaders in Silicon Valley.

“We don’t engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission, because we believe impact only comes with focus,” Armstrong wrote in a blog post. “We don’t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission. Even if we all agree something is a problem, we may not all agree on the solution.”

5 Times Studies Proved Wikipedia’s Left-Wing Bias,['T.D. Adler'],"Multiple academic studies and critical analyses of Wikipedia have pointed towards the site’s left-wing bias. The findings include its content being more left-leaning than Encyclopedia Britannica and left-leaning editors being more active and partisan than right-leaning editors. Left-wing outlets have been found to be the top-cited sources and represent most citations on articles about American politicians, and right-leaning editors have at the same time been found to be six times more likely to face sanctions.

Such studies and analyses validate criticism from the site’s co-founder, Larry Sanger, who earlier this year declared Wikipedia’s neutrality policy “dead” due to left-wing bias on the site. Following are five studies and analyses demonstrating Wikipedia bias:

More biased than Encyclopedia Britannica

One study from Harvard Business School academics Shane Greenstein and Feng Zhu analyzed the content of Wikipedia to determine whether it showed a political bias. In the study, Greenstein and Zhu examined articles covering U.S. politics on Wikipedia and compared them to similar articles in Encyclopedia Britannica, the oldest English-language encyclopedia whose articles are written by vetted experts unlike the volunteer amateurs often editing Wikipedia pages. Using an academic method to examine bias, the researchers looked at word choices more consistent with left-wing and right-wing views respectively.

The study found that articles on Wikipedia tended to show greater left-wing bias based on this method than comparable articles in Encyclopedia Britannica. In the case of both, the study found the encyclopedias exhibited a left-wing bias. Greenstein and Zhu concluded one reason for this bias was the length of Wikipedia articles relative to Britannica. On a per-word basis, they found Wikipedia was slightly-less biased, though still found it showed a left-wing bias. They further found that bias declined the more edits an article received, with the most-biased tending to be the least edited.

Left-wing editors more active and partisan

Greenstein and Zhu published a subsequent paper with Grace Gu using these same methods to examine individual editors and their biases. Corroborating the previous study, the researchers found editors showing a left-wing bias tended to be more active and more partisan than their right-wing counterparts. However, the researchers also concluded many editors moderate their bias in editing the more they edit and thus over many years left-wing editors moved towards a more neutral stance somewhat more quickly. One flaw in the study is it excludes editors who made over 950 edits in a year, which excludes many of the site’s most active partisans.

Top-cited news outlets mainly left-wing

Wikipedia sourcing has been the subject of critical analysis as well with one instance being looking at the top-cited outlets on the site. The 2018 analysis by editor “SashiRolls” published at Wikipedia criticism site Wikipediocracy used Wikipedia’s internal search engine to identify how many articles cited specific sources. What the resulting data showed is that establishment left-leaning outlets such as the New York Times and BBC News, each cited in around 200,000 articles, were often the most-cited news sources. The left-wing Guardian was the third most-cited outlet with almost 100,000 articles citing the outlet. Among the top ten outlets cited in Wikipedia articles, only one was right-leaning.

Pages on American politicians mostly cite left-wing outlets

Narrowing the review of Wikipedia sourcing, one user on Wikipediocracy specifically examined the extent to which sources were used on articles about American politicians as of July of this year. The analysis looked at all articles included in the category for 21st Century American Politicians and used a public tool to pull the sources cited in those articles. Each source was then categorized based on bias determinations by both AllSides and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), sites that publish bias ratings for news media.

What the analysis found is that articles on American politicians tended to rely on left-wing media. Based on AllSides ratings, 33,000 sources used were left-wing with 44,000 being left-wing based on MBFC ratings. Right-wing sources were shown to be more rarely used with such sources being cited less than 10,000 times according to either rating site. Centrist sources were used more often and closer to the number of times left-wing sources were used. Neither ratings site has rated all of the outlets cited on Wikipedia, while some ratings differ between the two sites.

Right-leaning editors six times more likely to be sanctioned

Connecting sourcing bias and editorial bias, two American academics analyzed bias in Wikipedia’s policy enforcement on political articles in a piece for British magazine the Critic. The academics looked at “arbitration enforcement” cases where administrators with special privileges on the site can impose restrictions on editors under sanction regimes applied by the Arbitration Committee, often likened to a Supreme Court. Often applied by topic area, the analysis looked specifically at how sanctions were handed out in areas such as U.S. presidential politics, abortion, gun control, and race and intelligence.

The analysis showed that, in every area, those editors whose contributions favored the right-leaning perspective were more likely to be sanctioned. In some cases, the samples were not large enough, but in the area of U.S. politics cases concerning President Donald Trump, the analysis found editors favoring a pro-Trump perspective were about six times more likely to be sanctioned based on 114 cases. Examining all areas together similarly found editors favoring a right-leaning perspective were six times more likely to be sanctioned than those favoring the left-leaning perspective. The academics suggested administrative bias could explain right-leaning sources being disfavored on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia becomes widely-praised and influential

Site co-founder Larry Sanger this year examined bias in several articles when declaring Wikipedia had abandoned neutrality. He noted President Barack Obama’s article mentioned none of his Administration’s scandals, but scandals on President Trump’s page were extensively documented. The sourcing bias identified in several analyses contributes to such content bias as with articles on Antifa and Black Lives Matter. One reason for Wikipedia’s sourcing bias is right-wing media being subject to a years-long purge invoking policies on “verifiability” and “reliable” sourcing. Many editors cite combating “fake news” to justify the purge, a narrative pushed by the site’s owners following advice from a Clinton-tied public relations firm.

In a communications audit by the firm Minassian Media, they noted Wikipedia was usually covered favorably, except when the site’s reliability was the subject of the story. Pushing the site as a challenge to “opinionated news” citing the 2016 election was how the firm recommended improving Wikipedia’s reputation. The effort has been an apparent success with many corporate media outlets praising the site, even on its handling of political articles where edits favored left-wing views. Companies in Big Tech and organizations such as the World Health Organization have also seized on claims of Wikipedia’s reliability to incorporate the site into their efforts against “misinformation” online.

Demonstrated left-wing bias indicates how harmful Wikipedia’s influence can become. Previous studies have already shown Wikipedia can shape scientific literature and economic behaviors with some studies raising whether it can influence elections. In the case of the 2020 Presidential election, articles about Hunter Biden and both former Vice President Joe Biden and current President Trump saw tens of thousands of views on Election Day, hundreds of thousands in the preceding weeks. However, articles about the Bidens were slanted in their favor due partly to widespread censorship of alleged Biden family corruption aided by restrictions against citing the right-wing outlets covering the allegations, while Trump-related articles have seen multiple smear campaigns.

UT San Antonio Sorority Kicks Student Out over Pro-Trump TikTok,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A University of Texas-San Antonio (UTSA) student was kicked out of her sorority over a pro-Trump TikTok post featuring a sign reading “All Lives Matter.” Sorority leadership at the school told the student that language suggesting “all lives matter” is “extremely hurtful” and “unsisterly.”

UTSA student Jaycie Barton, a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA) sorority as well as president of the school’s Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter, posted a video supporting President Donald Trump to her TikTok account in August.

The video, an eight-second clip featuring demonstrators holding an American flag and signs reading “Trump 2020,” “All Lives Matter,” and “Back the Blue,” subsequently got the student kicked out of her sorority.

On September 19, Barton received an email from UTSA ZTA’s judicial chairman, informing her that she had been charged with failing to “cooperate in the best interest of the Fraternity,” and for conducting herself “in a manner detrimental to her chapter and/or members of the Fraternity,” among other things.

The email went on to clarify that the charges were specifically for: “the statement ‘All Lives Matter’ is extremely hurtful to our sisters and is very unsisterly,” adding, “ZTA stands for Black Lives Matter and the statement ‘All Lives Matter’ goes against ZTA’s belief.”

“We have what’s called judicial board, where you get called up when you’ve done something wrong in the sorority,” explained Barton to Breitbart News, adding that a disciplinary hearing regarding her TikTok post was later held via Zoom.

During the sorority’s disciplinary hearing on September 21, one member argued that “Zeta is trying to be more inclusive, and saying ‘all lives matter’ is not being very inclusive.”

“It’s very unsisterly and very hurtful to a lot of people,” the member added.

Barton, however, told Breitbart News that she does support black lives.

“It’s pretty clear that I do support black lives,” said Barton. “And I don’t understand how the sorority cannot see that the word ‘all’ includes everyone.”

The student added that when she initially joined the sorority, no one had made her aware that she would have to support the Marxist political organization Black Lives Matter in order to retain her membership.

“I wasn’t joining the sorority to be a supporter of BLM,” said Barton. “I joined for philanthropy, which was breast cancer education and awareness, and to work alongside our sisters that would be open to all members, regardless of their political opinions and beliefs.”

Following the sorority’s disciplinary hearing, ZTA informed Barton that she had been removed from her leadership position as Risk Reduction and Education chair and that she was required “to complete a sensitivity training that involves inclusion and diversity.”

Barton said that she was later removed from the sorority completely, following another hearing regarding her TikTok post. The student added that she had requested to contact someone from the sorority’s national office regarding the matter, but that ZTA members would not allow it.

Barton told Breitbart News that as a result, she was bullied and smeared by sorority members, which she said runs counterintuitive to what ZTA claims to stand for.

“The sorority advocates for mental health, yet they allowed all these girls in the sorority to call me racist, flat out bullying me,” she said.

"Donald Trump Calls for Section 230 Repeal as Parler CEO Says Facebook, Twitter ‘Not Neutral Actors’",['Kyle Olson'],"President Donald Trump called for the termination of Section 230 protection for internet companies as an upstart social media CEO has urged a more nuanced approach.

For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

“For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!” Trump posted on Twitter late Thursday.

Earlier this month, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) clashed with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over his company’s use of “warnings” on tweets related to the election.

After admitting he is not an expert on voter fraud, Dorsey said Twitter is labeling posts “so that people have more information.”

“No you’re not. You put up a page saying, quote, ‘voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States’. That’s not linking to a broader conversation, that’s taking a disputed policy position, and you’re a publisher when you’re doing that,” Cruz said. “You’re entitled to take a policy position, but you don’t get to pretend you’re not a publisher and get a special benefit under Section 230 as a result.”

In October, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency would “clarify ambiguities” in a provision that grants immunity to tech companies that act as “platforms.” Many conservatives have argued Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have acted more like “publishers” when they censor content.

“The beauty of Section 230 is that it protects neutral actors from liability,” Parler CEO John Matze told The Kyle Olson Show last month, confessing he is not a lawyer, but an engineer.

“As the founder (of Parler), I like Section 230, especially for us, because we are a neutral town square. We don’t weigh in on the content of the user,” he said, adding users “define their own experience.”

“The problem with Section 230 is that Facebook and Twitter are already in violation of Section 230 because they’re not neutral actors, they’re acting as publishers,” Matze said.

“You don’t really need to repeal something that’s just being ignored,” he said, noting if those companies were following it, “they wouldn’t be creating rules to kind of kick out one ideological group.”

“Throughout my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission, I have favored regulatory parity, transparency, and free expression,” Pai said, Breitbart News previously reported.

“Social media companies have a First Amendment right to free speech. But they do not have a First Amendment right to a special immunity denied to other media outlets, such as newspapers and broadcasters.”

It is not clear when the FCC will formalize its “clarification.”

U. of South Florida Celebrates Thanksgiving by Claiming Campus Is Built on Native American Land,['Tom Ciccotta'],"The University of South Florida acknowledged this week that its Tampa Bay campus is located on land that was previously owned by Native American communities. The university’s anthropology released a statement intended to coincide with Thanksgiving that claims: “As a Department, we recognize the historical and continuing impacts of colonization on Indigenous communities, their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and fully support Indigenous Sovereignty.”

According to a report by the Tampa Bay Times, the University of South Florida acknowledged this week that its campus is located on land that was once owned by “Indigenous communities.”

The university’s department of anthropology released a statement this week to recognize the university’s use of Native American land. The statement was released this week to bring attention to the alleged inaccuracies that the department claims are present in many historical depictions of the First Thanksgiving.

“As a Department, we recognize the historical and continuing impacts of colonization on Indigenous communities, their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and fully support Indigenous Sovereignty. We will continue work to be more accountable to the needs of American Indian and Indigenous peoples.”

The university’s spokesperson, Althea Paul, said that the university is working with the department of anthropology to honor the legacy of the Native American communities that previously occupied the land.

“The University of South Florida values faculty efforts focused on diversity and inclusion,” Paul said. “We appreciate the Department of Anthropology’s initiative to acknowledge this important part of our history and pay respect to the Indigenous communities who came before us.”

Breitbart News reported this week that a professor at Portland State University told students during a lecture at Washington State University that Thanksgiving is offensive and should be replaced with a “National Day of Mourning” for Indigenous people.

Princeton to Welcome Students Back to Campus in Spring,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Princeton University announced this week that students will return to campus for the spring semester. Most Princeton students have attended their courses remotely since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in March. The return to campus does come with stringent rules — students will be prohibited from hosting visitors and leaving campus.

According to a local news report, Princeton University is one of several universities that will invite students back to campus for the spring semester. Students at universities and colleges around the nation were forced to adopt virtual classroom technology in March. Now, students at Princeton will be required to comply with a variety of restrictions if they want to return to campus.

Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber explained this week that the university will utilize a robust coronavirus testing regime to mitigate the spread of the virus.

“During the fall term, we cultivated strong public health norms and practices on the Princeton campus; monitored and learned from experiences with the virus at Princeton and elsewhere; and established an on-campus testing laboratory,” Eisgruber wrote in a statement. “In light of that work, we have concluded that, if we test the campus population regularly, and if everyone on campus rigorously adheres to public health guidance about masking, social distancing and other practices, we can welcome a far greater number of students back to Princeton.”

The university has also adopted several strict restrictions for the spring semester. Students will be prohibited from hosting visitors and leaving campus. Additionally, students will be required to quarantine upon their arrival to campus in January.

Breitbart News reported in September that Princeton was investigated by the Department of Education after its president claimed that “racism” was “embedded in the structures” of the university. The Department of Education told Princeton that it was launching an investigation into the university’s practices to ensure that it was not in violation of various non-discrimination laws.

"Report: ‘Smart’ Doorbells Sold on Amazon, eBay Filled with Security Vulnerabilities",['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report states that a number of “smart” doorbells featuring microphones and cameras sold on Amazon and eBay come stocked with a number of security vulnerabilities.

CyberScoop reports that the U.K.-based security company NCC Group and consumer advocacy group Which? have discovered major security vulnerabilities in 11 “smart” doorbells sold on Amazon and eBay. One major flaw could allow a remote attacker to break into the owner’s wireless network by swiping login credentials while another critical bug could enable attackers to intercept and manipulate data on the network.

The investigation of the devices found that many doorbells made by obscure vendors that received top reviews on Amazon and eBay were extremely vulnerable. Researchers believe that many of the devices store sensitive data including location data and audio and video captured by the doorbell’s camera on insecure servers. One device made by a company named Victure sent a user’s wireless name and password, completely unencrypted, to servers in China, researchers reported.

Amazon said in a statement that it requires products sold on its site to be compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that it has tools to detect and prevent “unsafe or non-compliant products from being listed in our stores.” eBay said that it takes down listings that violate its safety standards but that the devices flagged by researchers did not meet the company’s threshold. A spokesperson for the doorbell manufacturer Victure denied that the company sent usernames and passwords to Chinese servers.

Matt Lewis, the research director of the project, said that his team’s findings indicate “a wider culture that favors shortcuts over security in the manufacturing process.” Other research found that home-networking devices ranging from routers to webcams also suffer from major security vulnerabilities.

Last week, the U.S. Congress passed long-awaited legislation that would set security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) vendors that contract with the U.S. government.

Columbia Prof: Rockefeller Christmas Tree Should be Canceled for the ‘Toxic Relationship’ of ‘Nature and Capitalism’,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A professor at Columbia University says that the iconic Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree should be “canceled,” because it represents a “toxic relationship shared between nature and capitalism.”

“Its appearance was a metaphor for this year of pandemic, a slapdash coup attempt, and a general drubbing of American exceptionalism.,” wrote professor Brian Kahn of the unveiling of this year’s Rockefeller Christmas tree in an op-ed published in Gizmodo.

The professor went on to call the tradition a “toxic” symbol of how nature is treated, adding that this year’s Norway spruce “should be the last” if we want to see any “justice.”

“This year’s tree is also perfectly poised to reflect something more than our national mood: It reflects the absolutely toxic relationship we have with the natural world and the need to rapidly reverse course,” said Kahn. “If this year’s tree sees any justice, it’s that it should be the last.”

Kahn then claimed that “everything about this tree tells a piece of the story of our past century-plus relationship with nature and extractive capitalism,” and that the tree lost its “dignity” when it was transported to Manhattan earlier this month.

“The tree is a Norway spruce, which, as you can likely guess from the name, is not native to the U.S. That in and of itself reflects how upended our relationship with nature is,” wrote Kahn. “In its previous home, though, it had an iota of dignity lost completely once it was transported to Midtown Manhattan.”

The professor wrote that the process in cutting down the tree — which included rescuing an owl that was found in it — reflects how “we’ve subjugated nature to our whims.”

“The Rockefeller tree was cut down in a town itself carved out of what was, more than a century ago, an old growth forest,” wrote Kahn. “And an owl was scooped up in the process of cutting down the tree and transported to New York.”

“All this reflects the ways in which we’ve subjugated nature to our whims,” the professor continued. “And really, the evolution of the Rockefeller Center tree tradition is a very apt stand-in for that in general.”

“Even our adorable feathered stowaway is a symbol of our toxic relationship with nature,” he added. “The Northern saw-whet owl is currently considered a low-concern species due to human pressures and has even managed to carve a niche out in human landscapes (clearly). But the climate crisis fueled by unending growth and fossil fuels will eventually come for it, too.”

The professor concluded by acknowledging that he’ll likely be called a “tree hugger” and a “total killjoy” for his remarks, but that he believes Americans today likely need this tree “to feel something like normal again,” just as they did during the Great Depression.

“I know I’ll likely receive many a furious email cussing me out for being a tree hugger perpetrating the war on Christmas and a total killjoy,” wrote Kahn. “But my point isn’t that we should end joy and piss on Santa. It’s that now is the perfect moment to consider what we truly value.”

“When I saw the Rockefeller Center tree propped up as it shed entire boughs to the cold plaza ground this year, I felt no elation,” he added. “I just felt sad that we venerate the continued subjugation of nature at the expense of unfettered growth and consumption — or even simply because we, like those who suffered through the Great Depression, want to feel something like normal again.”

"YouTube Celebrates ‘Unthanksgiving,’ Honoring ‘Indigenous Resistance’",['Allum Bokhari'],"The official YouTube account on Twitter celebrated what it called “Unthanksgiving” on Thursday, an obscure holiday the far-left platform claims is meant to honor “indigenous resistance.”

The official account of the Google-owned video platform has not posted any tweet celebrating Thanksgiving, snubbing the holiday currently being celebrated by its millions of American users in favor a 5-tweet thread about “unthanksgiving.”

From the thread:

For Indigenous and Native Americans, the fourth Thursday of November is dedicated to Indigenous history, activism, and resistance. It’s called Unthanksgiving. Unthanksgiving is about acknowledging, educating, and honoring centuries of Indigenous resistance. Coinciding with New England’s National Day of Mourning, Unthanksgiving activates Alcatraz Island, the site of a 19-month occupation by Bay Area Natives in 1969. For generations, Native Americans and Indigenous persons have shared their experiences, using Unthanksgiving as an opportunity for intergenerational and intercultural dialogue. Generations before have lived on these lands. Days like Unthanksgiving are opportunities for learning and understanding whose land you live on. Find out here → https://native-land.ca Unthanksgiving is about honoring Native American and Indigenous heritage, to better understand this history. How are you connected to – and connecting with – Indigenous heritage and history where you live?

The initial tweet in YouTube’s thread has been “ratioed,” meaning it has attracted more replies and quotes – the vast majority of which mock or condemn the thread – than retweets.

Google, which owns YouTube, is known for its woke left-wing culture. In 2018, Breitbart News reported on a leaked document from inside the company instructing managers to be wary of rewarding employees for adhering to the values of “white male dominant culture.”

Beyond left-wing virtue signaling, Google has also engaged in election interference. Six months before the election, following a major change to its core search algorithm, clicks and impressions to Breitbart News from Google searches for “Joe Biden,” dropped to zero and stayed there through election day. Prior to Google’s update, clicks and impressions from the search term saw a normal pattern of activity.

Twitter’s policy on blocking links states: “At times, Twitter will take action to limit or prevent the spread of URL links to content outside Twitter. This is done by displaying a warning notice when the link is clicked, or by blocking the link so that it can’t be Tweeted at all.”

The platform describes the categories of links it will block:

Malicious links such as malware and phishing

Spammy and misdirecting links

Links that break Twitter rules on such topics as terrorism, child sexual exploitation, illegal goods, hateful conduct, violence, etc.

Hacked Materials

Twitter also claims it will block links that include “Content that interferes with civic and election integrity.” The example given in this category is: “Misleading information about how to vote or register to vote.” It is not yet clear if Twitter is justifying its censorship of a filed lawsuit based on this policy.

Some users have since tweeted about the situation:

I tried sharing the Powell links but the Twitter Gods said it’s harmful information. First time in human history reading a lawsuit alleging voter fraud is considered harmful. — An0n661 (@An0n661) November 26, 2020

Powell’s lawsuit makes a number of claims about voter fraud in multiple states, discussing Georgia the lawsuit says:

Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia. Especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County. This scheme and artifice to defraud affected tens of thousands of votes in Georgia alone and “rigged” the election in Georgia for Joe Biden. … [V]ideo from the State Farm Arena in Fulton County shows that on November 3rd after the polls closed, election workers falsely claimed a water leak required the facility to close. All poll workers and challengers were evacuated for several hours at about 10:00 PM. However, several election workers remained unsupervised and unchallenged working at the computers for the voting tabulation machines until after 1:00 AM.

"Study: Smartphone Notifications Don’t Distract Us, We Distract Ourselves",['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent study has found that users initiate 89 percent of all smartphone interactions on their own, with only 11 percent being initiated by a notification. These results go against the conventional wisdom that the mountain of notifications generated on the average person’s phone every day distracts us from other tasks.

Psych News Daily reports that a recent study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior on November 21 claims that 89 percent of smartphone interactions are initiated by users while only 11 percent are initiated by a notification.

The study states: “The perceived disruptiveness of smartphones is not mainly driven by external notifications, but by an urge of the user to interact with their phone that seems to occur in an almost automatic manner, just as a smoker would light a cigarette.”

The study followed the smartphone usage of people in the UK, Germany, and France. The average age of the subjects was 26 and just over half of the subjects were male. The study authors, Max Heitmayer and Saadi Lahlou, are both affiliated with the London School of Economics.

The subjects were equipped with a tiny camera called “subcams” which filmed the subject’s daily lives from a first-person perspective. The subjects recorded their behavior for a total of around five hours over a three-day period. The subjects could turn the camera off at any time and were allowed to delete any footage they wished.

The end result was around 200 hours of footage of user behavior in real-world environments. This totaled around 1,130 smartphone interactions that the researchers could analyze. The study found that the time between smartphone interactions was on average 291 seconds, meaning users were checking their phones around once every five minutes.

The researchers noted that many users felt compelled to check their devices even when they had notifications switched off. One subject stated: “Seeing this has made me realize that I don’t even remember picking it up.”

U. of Iowa Prof Elizabeth Pearce Offers Thanksgiving Meals to Students Stuck on Campus,['Tom Ciccotta'],"A professor at the University of Iowa has offered Thanksgiving meals to students that are stuck on campus as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Professor Elizabeth Pearce received an outpouring of praise and support after her message to her students went viral.

According to a report by Good Morning America, Professor Elizabeth Pearce of the University of Iowa went viral this week after she offered Thanksgiving meals to students that will spend the holiday on campus due to the pandemic.

In the email, Pearce said that she wanted to offer a home-cooked family dinner to students that had chosen to stay on campus over the holiday weekend.

Good morning. I know this has been a difficult time for a lot of you — some of you have had Covid, some of you are currently in quarantine, and some of you may not be able to go home for Thanksgiving as you have family members who are socially distancing. I don’t want anyone to feel alone at Thanksgiving, or to miss out on a homecooked family dinner, so I want to invite you to share my Thanksgiving dinner. I’ve talked with my kids and we would be happy to make extra portions of everything and drop it by your apartment or residence (as long as its within a 20 mile radius0. Since we’re all socially distancing we would leave it outside and not have physical contact with you.

Pearce said that she plans to prepare the meals with the help of her children, who will utilize facial coverings during meal preparation. The professor even offered students various dishes to choose from and a “vegan option.”

I truly want you to take me up on this offer if you are in town. As I mentioned, my kids have been socially distancing and we will make the food wearing masks to reduce the likelihood of anything being spread. My youngest daughter is vegan so there’ll be a vegan option. Check out the menu below. If you are socially distancing with a roommate or significant other, I’ll be happy to drop off two or even three portions.

Breitbart News reported in September that the University of Iowa was forced to spend $1 million to repair damage to campus that was caused by rioters that participated in a local Black Lives Matter protest. Several buildings on campus were defaced in graffiti with slogans including “BLM and “say their names.”

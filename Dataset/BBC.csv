Covid-19: Virus 'back under control' says Matt Hancock,[],"Getty Images Copyright: Getty Images

Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.

This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases ‚Äì people who do not have symptoms.

It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.

Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.

It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.

Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.

Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.

But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.

These tests were never intended for community use like this. When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases.

The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness of this programme is far from certain.",BBC,1

"The Grand Tour stars on pirate treasure, cycle lanes and electric cars",[],"The Grand Tour stars on pirate treasure, cycle lanes and electric cars By Steven McIntosh

Entertainment reporter Published duration 17 hours ago

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption It took real boules to film some scenes in the new Madagascar special

Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempt to find pirate treasure in their new special, The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt.

The trio head to Madagascar for their latest Amazon film, with little more than a car each and a historical treasure map.

The challenge starts with the tale of an 18th Century pirate known as La Buse (The Buzzard). Legend has it that, before he died, he buried his treasure - worth ¬£100m in today's money - somewhere in the Seychelles.

When he was finally captured and executed in 1730, he hurled a piece of parchment into the crowd, shouting: ""My treasure for he who can understand!""

image copyright Getty Images image caption La Buse (left), who was executed in 1730, and his tomb on the French island of La Reunion

The parchment contained a 17-line cryptogram which apparently revealed where his treasure was buried... but only if someone was able to decipher it.

Many have tried and failed over the centuries to locate the loot. We've been speaking to Clarkson, Hammond and May about their own hunt (and a few other things in between).

1. Some were more hopeful about finding the treasure than others

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Hammond was the most optimistic of the group about genuinely finding the treasure

In the course of the 90-minute special, May makes a decent and serious attempt to crack the codes. Which raises the question, did the team ever think they might actually discover the treasure?

""Yes! I did all along,"" says the lovably enthusiastic Hammond. ""I'm a massive fan of all of that stuff. It's historical fact that a lot of these people did exist, as did their treasure. So you never know, there was a chance.""

Executive producer Andy Wilman has a slightly different reaction when we put the same question to him.

""Are you mentally deranged?"" he asks us, which we'll take as a no.

""I'll tell you what it did do, it made you a kid again. I'm getting paid to hunt for buried treasure, like I'm seven. It's one of those situations where your tongue has got to come through your cheek. So the viewer can see [we know] that this is nonsense. But you go with it because of the journey, it's a great adventure to go on.""

2. The title (surprisingly) wasn't their idea

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption A Massive Hunt was filmed prior to the coronavirus pandemic

You might have thought that the team would have a hard time topping the name of last year's special, The Grand Tour presents: Seamen, which saw the trio swap cars for boats. But they've outdone themselves here.

So whose idea was The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt?

""You won't believe me when I tell you, but it was the people we work for,"" reveals Wilman. ""Old big corporate Amazon.

""We were batting titles backwards and forwards and it was like 'best one wins'. And then I got a text from their head of marketing and I was like, 'oh yeah, game over, our work is done now'.""

3. Madagascar: Worse than Swindon

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption May says he's never driven on a road as difficult as this one in Madagascar

Perhaps the most gripping section of the new special comes when the trio have to find their way along a road in Madagascar - although the word ""road"" is being rather generous.

""It's extraordinary that it's actually marked on a map as a thing you can drive a vehicle on,"" says a bewildered Clarkson. ""I'm not surprised the Madagascans threw the French out if that was their idea of a road, because it just isn't one.""

May admits: ""In terms of trying to get your car to the end, we honestly thought near the beginning of filming that we simply weren't going to be able to do it.

""I've never driven on a road that difficult to simply negotiate. It's worse than the centre of Swindon, with all those mini roundabouts. You could spend the rest of your life there if you're not careful.""

4. Clarkson remains unconvinced by electric cars

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Clarkson woke up to the issue of climate change last year - but hasn't changed his lifestyle

You may remember Clarkson publicly acknowledged climate change for the first time in last year's special, after the awful conditions the team witnessed in Cambodia. But that doesn't mean he's about to change his behaviour.

""I've just ordered a new Bentley, with a V8 engine, so that's where I stand,"" he says. ""[Hammond and May] both have electric cars now but I'm carbon offsetting them.""

He refers to recent reports of ""appalling"" child slavery in the Democratic Republic of Congo, after the huge surge in demand for cobalt - a critical metal for electric car batteries.

""They're also very expensive and completely impractical and have the personality of a vacuum cleaner but if that's what you like, help yourself to an electric car.""

5. And it's probably best you don't mention cycle lanes to him either

image copyright PA Media image caption More cycle lanes have sprung up in London this year as a way to avoid public transport

...because it sounds like he had quite a traumatic experience travelling to the press launch.

""It took me three hours to get to where I am this morning, because the Mayor of London is an imbecile,"" he says with his usual tact. ""He's just turned the whole damn city into a cycle lane.

""I don't mind one or two cycle lanes where it's convenient but he's put one in the Euston underpass. I mean, the man's a maniac and must be stopped.""

Clarkson has always enjoyed being provocative with the things he says, but we thought we'd better put these comments to the Mayor of London.

A spokesman for Sadiq Khan told us: ""London is facing an air quality crisis which is causing thousands of deaths per year and exacerbating the physical effects of Covid-19. Half of toxic emissions in the city are caused by road transport.

""These policies are about saving lives and Sadiq makes no apologies for the temporary emergency measures he has put in place to encourage the huge increase in cycling we've seen since the pandemic began which is also enabling social distancing on public transport. We mustn't get through one public health crisis only to face another caused by congestion and toxic air pollution.""

6. The team hope viewers might fancy a crack

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption James May encourages viewers to try to crack the cryptogram, which is available online

After the special is released next month, James May hopes it will prompt renewed interest with the public in finding the treasure.

""The coded message is available in various books and online, and there are many ways of reading it and interpreting it, as I hope I showed, but if other people want to have a crack at it, I think that would be very interesting,"" he says.

""Even if you did manage to translate it, it would be in an old language which we're not very familiar with, so getting all the way through to what it actually means is going to require massive research knowledge and interpretative skills. But even if it's just for a bit of fun, I hope people still have a go at it, it's quite absorbing actually.""

7. The next special will be in Scotland

Wilman describes having to edit the Madagascar film over Zoom as ""a living hell"".

Lockdown also meant the team had to get creative when they began filming their next special, and find something to do within the UK.

""We were trying to think of different options, and where we ended up was we just shot one recently up in Scotland, a kind of mini coronavirus special, which will be 60-odd minutes rather than 90,"" Wilman explains

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption All three Grand Tour stars got their own deal for a solo show when they signed with Amazon

But how much longer will the trio continue doing The Grand Tour? They've been with Amazon since 2015, and were on Top Gear for 13 years before that.

""I am aware of ageing, and perhaps the need to grow up, now I'm in the second half of my 50s,"" says May. ""But I think we'll do it for a bit yet because, to be honest, people want us to, and it would be wrong of us to disappoint them.

""But eventually one of us is going to snap, yes. Probably me. I'm quite fragile, really.""

Wilman explains that he and the trio all got individual solo deals when they signed with Amazon, which meant each was given their own series in addition to working on The Grand Tour.

As a result, Clarkson has done a farming series, Hammond has a forthcoming survivalist show, while James May recently launched his own cookery programme. ""I've still got one to do,"" Wilman says, although adds that he'll remain behind the scenes rather than on screen.

""We'd like to do two [Grand Tour specials] a year, that was the plan. We've still got two to do, on our current contract. And that's about right, two allows us to do other things, and keep Grand Tour going.""",BBC,1

A $50m danger-filled restoration,[],"On 21 June 2017, Iraqi forces were nearing the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul. One of the Iraqi city‚Äôs most famous and iconic landmarks, the mosque had stood in this part of Mosul ‚Äì the Old City ‚Äì since Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zangi, a Turkic ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, oversaw its construction between 1172 and 1173. It was not only a place of worship, but a representation of the city‚Äôs rich diversity: of different religions, art, education and culture. The mosque stood strategically placed in the heart of the city, surrounded by a network of tangled walkways and medieval streets that converged towards the city gates.

In July 2014, this mosque was where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance in his first and only public appearance. Days earlier he‚Äôd declared his caliphate, giving birth to his ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù.

Three years later, at 21:50 on that June 2017 day ‚Äì a blink of an eye in its more than 800 years of history ‚Äì the mosque was destroyed by the jihadist group, yet more devastation in a devastated city. Iraqi forces were fighting to take the mosque in what would be a landmark victory and had reportedly advanced to within 50m of its walls when explosives were detonated from the inside.

The challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri ‚Äì and with it part of Mosul‚Äôs identity ‚Äì are far greater than a typical restoration

Around the world, news stations looked on as satellite imagery showed rubble strewn across the patch of land where the mosque once stood. ‚ÄúDaesh‚Äôs [Islamic State‚Äôs] bombing of the al-Hadba minaret and the al-Nuri mosque is a formal declaration of their defeat,‚Äù said the then-Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi at the time. But what was left in its place was destruction.

Daesh was forced from the city in July 2017 in what ended a period of warfare known as the battle for Mosul. Then, Mosul‚Äôs long recovery began.

The al-Nuri mosque remained in pieces until December 2019 when the campaign to rebuild it was launched, a $50.44m project financed by the United Arab Emirates. The project is one element of a wider Unesco initiative known as Revive the Spirit of Mosul. Launched in February 2018 through a partnership between the Prime Minister of Iraq Mustafa al-Kadhimi and the UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, the project aims to restore the urban, social and cultural fabric of the Old City, one where late Ottoman buildings stand alongside bustling bazaars and khans (traditional merchants‚Äô dwellings). The Great Mosque of al-Nuri was at the spiritual heart of the Old City, a complex of prayer halls and buildings that spread out over roughly 11,050sq m.

At the mosque‚Äôs centre was the al Hadba minaret, a famed tower that looked out across the city. Throughout the years the minaret developed a natural, albeit precarious, lean to one side. This quirk not only gave the city of Mosul the unofficial nickname of ‚Äúthe hunchback‚Äù but its image is emblazoned on the 10,000 Iraqi Dinar bank note alongside a portrait of ·∏§asan Ibn al-Haytham, a Basrah-born mathematician and key figure of the Islamic Golden Age. From the 8th to the 13th Century, this revolutionary era of literature, science, medicine and astronomy made what is modern-day Iraq the intellectual centre of the world.

One of the people heading the Revive the Spirit of Mosul project is Paolo Fontani, who took up the role of Director and Representative of Unesco Iraq in 2019. ‚ÄúWhen I was asked to take this position, I remember thinking how I would be grateful if one day someone came to help me rebuild my own hometown,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll the monuments, the places that have marked my existence and constructed who I am. My identity...‚Äù

But the challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri ‚Äì and with it part of Mosul‚Äôs identity ‚Äì are far greater than a typical restoration. Fontani and his team have to contend with a building that is almost 850 years old, and also one that toppled in a warzone.

For work to begin, it was vital to assess what damage had been done. Normally, surveyors would inspect the building and note what needed to be fixed, but there was a problem: the site was far too dangerous for any human to enter. So in the place of humans came drones. These drones, explained Maria Rita Acetoso, senior project officer on the al-Nuri mosque project, surveyed both horizontal surfaces like the roofs of single buildings and vertical ones like a minaret. As they did, a number of geo-referenced photos were taken and pieced together to create a 3D model. This allowed them to effectively fly throughout the wreckage to map every fallen ceiling, and to photograph the 45m-tall minaret in high definition with ease.

After that came stabilising the area, which meant approaching the rubble as a booby-trapped site. Hidden amidst the wreckage, a large arsenal of mines and unexploded devices littered the area. ‚ÄúThere were around 300 or 400 cases of TNT under there,‚Äù said Acetoso . ‚ÄúThere were even IEDs hidden in the walls.‚Äù

Securing the site was overseen by the Iraqi authorities, who disarmed each explosive device individually. For Acetoso, this posed the greatest challenge. ‚ÄúThe reconstruction of historical landmarks is always challenging, but the de-mining came with an unknown threat,‚Äù she said. In collaboration with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and the State Board of Antiquities, a team of eight archaeologists were able to salvage artworks and artefacts from amongst the rubble that had miraculously survived the blast. In total, 44,000 bricks and 1,100 fragments of marble were recovered from the mosque and its minaret, all of which were catalogued and will eventually decorate the place of worship once again.

Considerable time was spent deciding whether the minaret would be re-erected in its original form ‚Äì that is, how it looked 850 years ago, or with a tilt, as it was when it was destroyed. The minaret will keep its lean, but the task of rebuilding this plinth is much more difficult than deciding on its aesthetic.

The biggest concern is around the fact that the minaret is the most fragile element of the entire build. When the mosque was destroyed, the explosion caused a partial collapse of the upper base of the minaret‚Äôs eastern side, causing the structure to rotate significantly as it fell.

The starting point in salvaging this landmark is by assessing the current strength and stability of what is left, determining what can be saved and what has been lost. This begins by retrieving samples from the existing masonry through endoscopic investigation, where small holes are drilled into the masonry, which are then inspected with a camera. This technique helps inform on everything from the chemical-physical composition of the original materials used and the strength of the bricks themselves, to the exact constructive processes used in the 12th Century or in past renovation attempts. This, says Acetoso, will allow them to rebuild the mosque to near its original form.

The process has been long and arduous. The Covid pandemic has delayed work for most of 2020, and construction won‚Äôt fully conclude until 2023. The rebuilding of Mosul doesn‚Äôt begin and end with Unesco, however. More than 5,000 buildings were damaged in the Old City alone, while across Mosul, according to original government estimates from 2018, at least $2bn in aid is needed for the city to recover. Mosul itself still suffers with a lack of electricity, internet or provisions.

The site was far too dangerous for any human to enter

‚ÄúMany families returned to Mosul and saw their own houses, churches, mosques, libraries and museums all destroyed,‚Äù said Father Najeeb Michaeel, Christian Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul, who is in the process of rebuilding his St Paul‚Äôs church on Mosul‚Äôs east side, which remains heavily damaged from the war. ‚ÄúThat's why we‚Äôre working hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder to clean and rebuild Mosul. Not just in stone, but in spirit.‚Äù

The road will be long and difficult, but Mosul‚Äôs recovery is not achieved solely through bricks and mortar. It‚Äôs achieved in the return of culture to Mosul ‚Äì of music, arts, education and literature ‚Äì which is what built the city in the beginning and which is how its future will be drawn.

‚ÄúThey discovered the art of writing and reading here. This is our life. The origin of humanity,‚Äù said Father Najeeb. ‚ÄúThis is our culture.‚Äù

With the festive period fast approaching, governments are facing tough questions about whether to ease restrictions in time for Christmas. In France, the government has said it will relax its national lockdown in phases.

It decided religious services would be able to take place, providing a 30-person limit was enforced. But the country's highest court has ordered a review of this limit, after it was challenged. Religious leaders argued that churches and cathedrals were more spacious than most public spaces.

""The claimants are right in saying that the measure is disproportionate,"" a court statement said. ""Thus it is a serious and illegal infringement on the freedom of worship.""

The government has been given three days to modify the policy and take proportionate measures. Elsewhere in Europe:

Thousands of health workers have marched in the Spanish capital, Madrid, in support of the country's public health system. They called for an increase in funding to cope with the pressures of the pandemic

Covid-19: Virus 'back under control' says Matt Hancock,[],"Getty Images Copyright: Getty Images

Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.

This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases ‚Äì people who do not have symptoms.

It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.

Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.

It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.

Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.

Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.

But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.

These tests were never intended for community use like this. When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases.

The government is pushing the boundaries. The effectiveness of this programme is far from certain.",BBC,1

The psychology behind ‚Äòrevenge bedtime procrastination‚Äô,[],"The sleep ‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô

Although people might resent work squeezing their leisure time, reducing sleep is probably not the best ‚Äòretaliation‚Äô. Sleep deprivation, especially long term, can lead to a host of harmful effects, both mental and physical. In Matthew Walker‚Äôs book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, the neuroscientist is blunt: ‚ÄúThe shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.‚Äù And people, in general, know this: everybody interviewed for this article felt their sleep patterns were unhealthy ‚Äì but they still kept late nights.

Psychology may explain the reason why people would choose to eke out this leisure time even at the expense of sleep. A growing body of evidence points to the importance of time away from work pressure; failure to detach can lead to stress, reduced wellbeing and burnout. ‚ÄúOne of the most important parts of recovery from work is sleep. However, sleep is affected by how well we detach,‚Äù says Sheffield University‚Äôs Kelly. It‚Äôs important, she explains, to have downtime when we can be mentally distanced from work, which would explain why people are willing to sacrifice sleep for post-work leisure.

‚ÄúPeople are stuck in a Catch-22 when they don‚Äôt have time to detach from their work before they go to sleep, it is likely to negatively affect their sleep,‚Äù says Kelly. The real solution, she suggests, is to ensure that individuals are allowed time to engage in activities that provide this detachment. However, this is often not something employees can achieve by themselves.

Heejung Chung, a labour sociologist at the University of Kent and an advocate for greater workplace flexibility, sees the practice of delaying sleep as the fault of employers. Tackling the problem would benefit workers but also help ensure a ‚Äúhealthy, efficient workplace‚Äù, she points out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a productivity measure,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou need that time to unwind. Workers need something to do other than work. It‚Äôs risky behaviour to do only one thing.‚Äù

Greater flexibility

Since the pandemic, companies in many nations have implemented work-from-home policies, introducing greater flexibility into working lives but also, in some cases, further blurring already tenuous boundaries between work and home. It‚Äôs not yet clear how this might affect the kind of work culture that leaves employees shunning sleep to claw back some free time.

Chung says that genuine change requires an institutional shift, across many companies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for individuals to react [to their work situation],‚Äù she says. But she does advise employees to talk to their colleagues and collectively approach their boss, with evidence, if they want to ask for change.

However, this might not be forthcoming in China. In fact, reports suggest that companies are digging in even more when it comes to overtime as they try to bounce back from losses caused by Covid-19. Krista Pederson, a consultant who works with multinationals and Chinese corporations from Beijing, says that she‚Äôs observed this trend. Chinese companies see their working culture as an advantage over markets like the US or Europe where people tend to work fewer hours: ‚ÄúThey know they have hard workers who are ruthless and will do whatever it takes to get ahead, including working all the time,‚Äù she says.

With such a demanding work culture, employees will keep on tackling the problem in a way that works for them. Despite burning the candle at both ends, Gu Bing loves her job and embraces her stolen leisure time. ‚ÄúSometimes, I really reckon night time is perfect, beautiful even,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMy friends and I, we converse at night and sometimes we write songs together. It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful.‚Äù

And there is the option, for the lucky ones, of changing jobs, which is what Emma Rao did, finally swapping her 996 job for a slightly less demanding one. However, Rao has found that old habits are hard to shake. ‚ÄúIt is a revenge,‚Äù she says of her late bedtimes. ‚ÄúTo get back some time for yourself.‚Äù",BBC,1
The ships powered by 'green hydrogen',[],"But the real challenge for using it in long-distance shipping is how tricky it is to store. Hydrogen cannot simply replace bunkering fuel in the current system. To store it on board a ship as a liquid, it needs to be frozen using cryogenic temperatures of -253C (-423F), says Hubatova. And even then, it takes up a lot of space ‚Äì around eight times more than the amount of marine gas oil needed to give the same amount of energy, according to EDF analysis.

The extra space needed by hydrogen has caused concern in the industry that it might need to clear out cargo to make room for the fuel. But an analysis from the ICCT has found that this barrier could be overcome. It found that 43% of current voyages between China and the United States ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs busiest shipping lanes ‚Äì could be made using hydrogen without the need for cargo space or to stop more times to refuel. Nearly all the voyages could be powered by hydrogen with only minor changes to fuel capacity or operations, it found.

Ammonia alternative

Hydrogen is often used as a catch-all term for synthetic fuels, but many experts believe another option is actually better: using the green hydrogen to make green ammonia, another fuel which can be either combusted or used in a fuel cell. Ammonia is far easier to store than hydrogen (it needs refrigeration but not cryogenic temperatures), and takes up around half the space since it is far denser. It can also be converted back to hydrogen onboard a ship, meaning it could be loaded and stored on the ship as ammonia but ultimately used in a hydrogen fuel cell.

‚ÄúAt the moment, the best bet is to just turn [hydrogen] into ammonia, which is this ‚ÄòGoldilocks fuel‚Äô,‚Äù says Smith. ‚ÄúAmmonia is so much cheaper to store; you can store it at a pressurised tank, so you don't need to have any sort of cryogenics. It's only a small amount more expensive to make than hydrogen.‚Äù",BBC,1

Nikola shares plunged more than 20% on the news.

The new deal replaces an agreement announced in September in which GM had planned to take an 11% stake in Nikola and supply the startup with equipment for its highly anticipated hydrogen fuel cell trucksGM had also previously said it would build Nikola's planned pickup, the Badger.

Manchester United's Edinson Cavani apologizes for social media post as FA investigates,[],"(CNN) Edinson Cavani is apologizing for language he used in a social media post after he scored two goals for Manchester United in its Premier League match against Southampton on Sunday.

The Uruguayan thanked a follower using the phrase ""gracias negrito,"" which translates to thank you, little Black one.

The phrase is seen as an affectionate term of endearment in South America but considered offensive in other parts of the world, because its meaning can be misconstrued.

Having come on as a substitute at halftime on Sunday with Manchester United 2-0 behind, Cavani had an instant impact, scoring twice and assisting the other goal to help his side to a dramatic victory.

""The message I posted after the match on Sunday was intended as an affectionate greeting to a friend, thanking him for his congratulations after the game,"" Cavani said in an apology on the Manchester United website. ""The last thing I wanted to do was cause offence to anyone. I am completely opposed to racism and deleted the message as soon as it was explained that it can be interpreted differently.

"Another 709,000 Americans filed for unemployment claims last week",[],"New York (CNN Business) America's jobs recovery is slowing down. While many have been able to return to work, millions remain unemployed.

Another 709,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was a slightly smaller number of initial claims than economists had expected.

On top of that, another 298,154 workers filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program sanctioned under the CARES Act to provide benefits to those ineligible for regular state aid, such as the self-employed.

Together, first-time claims stood at 1 million last week, not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. That was a new low for the total number.

Still, it's been eight months since the pandemic crisis started, and the economic hardship created by mass layoffs remains for millions.

Survey: More than 1 in 3 small businesses wonâ€™t survive past the next three months without additional financial relief,[],"For months, Congress and the White House have conducted negotiations on another round of stimulus relief in fits and starts as they struggle to agree on the size and scope of a stimulus package. Small Business Majorityâ€™s latest survey reveals that the uncertainty of whether more help will arrive has left too many small businesses on the brink of collapse.

The survey finds that without additional funding, more than 1 in 3 (35%) small business owners will not survive past the next three months. The number is even higher for small business owners of color: an astounding 41% of Black and Latino-owned businesses wonâ€™t make it through the next few months without additional financial support. And 1 in 5 small business owners report theyâ€™ve considered filing for bankruptcy. These numbers have grown since our last survey was released on August 27, when 26% of small businesses reported they wouldnâ€™t survive more than three months, and 16% reported theyâ€™ve considered bankruptcy.

To make matters worse, a wave of commercial evictions and foreclosures is likely on the horizon, with 8 in 10 small business owners reporting that they are struggling to make commercial rent or mortgage paymentsâ€”up 18% since late August. Slightly more business owners of color (84%) report the same. Equally troubling, 64% of all small businesses and 73% of Black and Latino-owned businesses are concerned they will have to permanently lay off employees without immediate federal relief. More than 6 in 10 Black and Latino small business owners are very concerned they will have to make permanent layoffs, and 10% have already done so.

Given these numbers, itâ€™s clear that small businesses need more assistance in order to survive the pandemic. When asked what the number one priority should be for Congress and the White House before Election Day, small businesses ranked a comprehensive stimulus package as their top concern. Fifty-five percent ranked negotiating on a comprehensive, bipartisan stimulus package that includes small business assistance and unemployment insurance as the number one priority, followed by 29% who want to see a standalone small business relief bill, 5% who want another round of stimulus checks for some Americans and 4% who want see the Supreme Court nominee confirmed.

The need for a comprehensive relief package comes at a time when small business owners are still experiencing a significant loss in consumer confidence. Forty-five percent of small business owners rank reduced consumer demand as the top concern for their business right now. One in five of all small business owners and more than 1 in 4 minority-owned businesses (27%) rank the health and safety of themselves, their employees and their customers as their top concern. Fifteen percent of Black and Latino owned businesses are still unable to reopen their businesses.

Additionally, small business owners are concerned about the future of their healthcare. In November, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of California v. Texas, a case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Seventy-four percent of all small businesses and 86% of Black and Latino-owned businesses are concerned that the Supreme Court may strike down all or part of the healthcare law, including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.

The findings of this survey paint a dire picture of what many small business owners are facing just weeks before Election Day. With no sign of an end to the health crisis in sight, small business owners are looking to Congress and the White House to provide more comprehensive relief to sustain their businesses and set our economy on a meaningful path toward recovery.

This is the fifth in a series of COVID-19 related surveys Small Business Majority has released of its network. Over time Small Business Majority has tracked the economic conditions facing small businesses, how well federal stimulus programs have served its network, the small business owners' views of proposed stimulus provisions, and other issues of importance.

Mortgage rates have never been this low,[],"Mortgage rates fell to another record low last week, for the 13th time this year.

The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.72%, according to Freddie Mac . That's the lowest level in the nearly 50 years of the mortgage giant's survey. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.28%.

Home sales are off the charts,[],"Even amid a global pandemic and high unemployment, people are still buying homes at the fastest rate in years.

Home sales rose again in October, at their highest pace in 14 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.

But a record low inventory of available homes and a greater number of luxury homes sold have pushed the median home price up to a record $313,000, almost 16% more than a year ago. Total housing inventory dropped 3% from September and is down nearly 20% from a year ago.

Homes sold at a swift pace in October, with more than 7 in 10 homes sold on the market for less than a month. At the current pace of sales, it would take just 2.5 months to clear the existing inventory â€” a record low.

Sales of existing homes â€” which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops â€” were up 4.3% from September and 26.6% from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million in October.

How a vaccine could upend real estate markets -- again,[],"In just a matter of months the coronavirus pandemic dramatically changed the landscape of the housing market, especially in big cities. But now news of a promising vaccine could turn the market on its head again.

Nationally, home prices have never been higher , driven up as surging demand due to record low mortgage rates comes up against historically low inventory of homes for sale.

But the most expensive urban areas have been experiencing the opposite problem. Cities like New York and San Francisco have seen higher vacancy rates and lower rents and sale prices as many people, untethered from office jobs, retreated to the suburbs and less densely populated areas.

But with potential vaccines on the horizon, real estate in big cities could see a turnaround.

""It's not going to be a light switch,"" said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraiser and consultant in New York City. ""But the news is starting to get people to be hopeful and think about returning to the city. Because right now, without a vaccine, it is status quo.""

While widespread vaccination is still a ways off , the news alone is a good sign that real estate in cities will continue to recover as the prospect of vaccines becomes more realistic, said Richard Smith, chairman and executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a nonprofit that studies recurring patterns in economics, social sciences and nature.

""Sometimes it is when the news gets less bad that you get your biggest gains,"" he said.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs), investments backed by real estate, that had cratered when the pandemic broke out, have already recovered some of their losses and moved higher on the vaccine news.

Here's what the vaccine could mean for renters and home buyers.

Will people return to cities?

The more a vaccine brings life closer to ""normal,"" the more city real estate markets will change, said Miller.

""Once the vaccine is out and the population begins seeing schools reliably open and the big companies bringing people back in, that's where it snowballs,"" he said. ""Then people can make plans around it.""

In Manhattan, the rental market will come back first, he said, because that activity has fallen the most and there is a lower bar to entry. But with rental inventory currently triple what it was a year ago, don't expect rents to go up soon.

The Manhattan rental market remains historically weak. Last month saw a record-high number of apartments available to rent and a record-high share of rental apartments leased with concessions like one or two months free rent, according to brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.

The vacancy rate in Manhattan is at a new all-time high of 6.14%. That's caused record price declines in rents. The median rent for a one bedroom in Manhattan in October, for example, was $3,064 a month, down 4.1% from September and down 14.8% from a year ago.

""There has been a precipitous drop in the cost of a rental and the expectation is that there is still more of that ahead, until the inventory is eaten up,"" said Miller. ""There is still a lot of runway ahead. We'll be well into 2021 and a vaccine until we get into an uptick in pricing.""

For those looking to buy, purchasing a home in New York will be more attractive when a vaccine makes all the things a city has to offer possible again, Miller said, including easy access to dining, theater, concerts and events.

""The first thing that has to happen in terms of really accelerating the re-adoption of city life in the post-pandemic world, is going to be when companies, especially the Fortune 500 companies as leaders, start to bring people back to work,"" he said.

Buyers won't leave the suburbs behind

The uncertainty of this past year has left a mark on buyers, particularly those with higher incomes who can afford a second home near the city as a refuge that requires no planes or planning, said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

""The virus made the home very important,"" said Herman. ""Working from home will be here to stay, in some way. It won't be only working from home, but some combination of at home and the office.""

That has created wish lists for new homes that include outdoor space and offices and it has expanded locations for buyers, lengthening the commuting tether between home and office, she said.

Strong demand in the suburbs and resort communities near cities will continue, she said. Even though many suburban areas around New York passed their pandemic peak in the summer, in many areas sales are still above levels seen a year ago.

""People have gotten used to working from home and are comfortable living farther from the city,"" she said. ""That won't change with a vaccine. Second homes will continue to be a booming market nationally.""

Will mortgage rates stay low?

Mortgage interest rates hit a 12th all-time low heading into November, and some economists say even lower rates may be ahead. Others, however, say the vaccine news could reverse the downward trend.

""While rates are always unpredictable, sustained record lows are looking less likely in light of recent events,"" said Brendan Phillips, a capital markets analyst at Better.com, an online lender. ""Rates jumped when pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced its Covid-19 vaccine had shown 90% efficacy in trials .""

Goldman Sachs analysts pointed to the encouraging progress of vaccine research as a reason to think the economy may sustain a ""V-shaped"" recovery, bouncing back quickly to pre-pandemic levels. Other economists say that the ability of Congress to finally pass a stimulus package will also affect the speed of the country's recovery from the current recession.

""Good news for the economy, though, usually means higher rates,"" said Phillips.",CNN,1

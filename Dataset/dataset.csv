Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.

This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases ‚Äì people who do not have symptoms.

It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.

Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.

It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.

Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.

Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.

But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.

These tests were never intended for community use like this. When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases.

Entertainment reporter Published duration 17 hours ago

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption It took real boules to film some scenes in the new Madagascar special

Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempt to find pirate treasure in their new special, The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt.

The trio head to Madagascar for their latest Amazon film, with little more than a car each and a historical treasure map.

The challenge starts with the tale of an 18th Century pirate known as La Buse (The Buzzard). Legend has it that, before he died, he buried his treasure - worth ¬£100m in today's money - somewhere in the Seychelles.

When he was finally captured and executed in 1730, he hurled a piece of parchment into the crowd, shouting: ""My treasure for he who can understand!""

image copyright Getty Images image caption La Buse (left), who was executed in 1730, and his tomb on the French island of La Reunion

The parchment contained a 17-line cryptogram which apparently revealed where his treasure was buried... but only if someone was able to decipher it.

Many have tried and failed over the centuries to locate the loot. We've been speaking to Clarkson, Hammond and May about their own hunt (and a few other things in between).

1. Some were more hopeful about finding the treasure than others

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Hammond was the most optimistic of the group about genuinely finding the treasure

In the course of the 90-minute special, May makes a decent and serious attempt to crack the codes. Which raises the question, did the team ever think they might actually discover the treasure?

""Yes! I did all along,"" says the lovably enthusiastic Hammond. ""I'm a massive fan of all of that stuff. It's historical fact that a lot of these people did exist, as did their treasure. So you never know, there was a chance.""

Executive producer Andy Wilman has a slightly different reaction when we put the same question to him.

""Are you mentally deranged?"" he asks us, which we'll take as a no.

""I'll tell you what it did do, it made you a kid again. I'm getting paid to hunt for buried treasure, like I'm seven. It's one of those situations where your tongue has got to come through your cheek. So the viewer can see [we know] that this is nonsense. But you go with it because of the journey, it's a great adventure to go on.""

2. The title (surprisingly) wasn't their idea

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption A Massive Hunt was filmed prior to the coronavirus pandemic

You might have thought that the team would have a hard time topping the name of last year's special, The Grand Tour presents: Seamen, which saw the trio swap cars for boats. But they've outdone themselves here.

So whose idea was The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt?

""You won't believe me when I tell you, but it was the people we work for,"" reveals Wilman. ""Old big corporate Amazon.

""We were batting titles backwards and forwards and it was like 'best one wins'. And then I got a text from their head of marketing and I was like, 'oh yeah, game over, our work is done now'.""

3. Madagascar: Worse than Swindon

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption May says he's never driven on a road as difficult as this one in Madagascar

Perhaps the most gripping section of the new special comes when the trio have to find their way along a road in Madagascar - although the word ""road"" is being rather generous.

""It's extraordinary that it's actually marked on a map as a thing you can drive a vehicle on,"" says a bewildered Clarkson. ""I'm not surprised the Madagascans threw the French out if that was their idea of a road, because it just isn't one.""

May admits: ""In terms of trying to get your car to the end, we honestly thought near the beginning of filming that we simply weren't going to be able to do it.

""I've never driven on a road that difficult to simply negotiate. It's worse than the centre of Swindon, with all those mini roundabouts. You could spend the rest of your life there if you're not careful.""

4. Clarkson remains unconvinced by electric cars

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Clarkson woke up to the issue of climate change last year - but hasn't changed his lifestyle

You may remember Clarkson publicly acknowledged climate change for the first time in last year's special, after the awful conditions the team witnessed in Cambodia. But that doesn't mean he's about to change his behaviour.

""I've just ordered a new Bentley, with a V8 engine, so that's where I stand,"" he says. ""[Hammond and May] both have electric cars now but I'm carbon offsetting them.""

He refers to recent reports of ""appalling"" child slavery in the Democratic Republic of Congo, after the huge surge in demand for cobalt - a critical metal for electric car batteries.

""They're also very expensive and completely impractical and have the personality of a vacuum cleaner but if that's what you like, help yourself to an electric car.""

5. And it's probably best you don't mention cycle lanes to him either

image copyright PA Media image caption More cycle lanes have sprung up in London this year as a way to avoid public transport

...because it sounds like he had quite a traumatic experience travelling to the press launch.

""It took me three hours to get to where I am this morning, because the Mayor of London is an imbecile,"" he says with his usual tact. ""He's just turned the whole damn city into a cycle lane.

""I don't mind one or two cycle lanes where it's convenient but he's put one in the Euston underpass. I mean, the man's a maniac and must be stopped.""

Clarkson has always enjoyed being provocative with the things he says, but we thought we'd better put these comments to the Mayor of London.

A spokesman for Sadiq Khan told us: ""London is facing an air quality crisis which is causing thousands of deaths per year and exacerbating the physical effects of Covid-19. Half of toxic emissions in the city are caused by road transport.

""These policies are about saving lives and Sadiq makes no apologies for the temporary emergency measures he has put in place to encourage the huge increase in cycling we've seen since the pandemic began which is also enabling social distancing on public transport. We mustn't get through one public health crisis only to face another caused by congestion and toxic air pollution.""

6. The team hope viewers might fancy a crack

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption James May encourages viewers to try to crack the cryptogram, which is available online

After the special is released next month, James May hopes it will prompt renewed interest with the public in finding the treasure.

""The coded message is available in various books and online, and there are many ways of reading it and interpreting it, as I hope I showed, but if other people want to have a crack at it, I think that would be very interesting,"" he says.

""Even if you did manage to translate it, it would be in an old language which we're not very familiar with, so getting all the way through to what it actually means is going to require massive research knowledge and interpretative skills. But even if it's just for a bit of fun, I hope people still have a go at it, it's quite absorbing actually.""

7. The next special will be in Scotland

Wilman describes having to edit the Madagascar film over Zoom as ""a living hell"".

Lockdown also meant the team had to get creative when they began filming their next special, and find something to do within the UK.

""We were trying to think of different options, and where we ended up was we just shot one recently up in Scotland, a kind of mini coronavirus special, which will be 60-odd minutes rather than 90,"" Wilman explains

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption All three Grand Tour stars got their own deal for a solo show when they signed with Amazon

But how much longer will the trio continue doing The Grand Tour? They've been with Amazon since 2015, and were on Top Gear for 13 years before that.

""I am aware of ageing, and perhaps the need to grow up, now I'm in the second half of my 50s,"" says May. ""But I think we'll do it for a bit yet because, to be honest, people want us to, and it would be wrong of us to disappoint them.

""But eventually one of us is going to snap, yes. Probably me. I'm quite fragile, really.""

Wilman explains that he and the trio all got individual solo deals when they signed with Amazon, which meant each was given their own series in addition to working on The Grand Tour.

As a result, Clarkson has done a farming series, Hammond has a forthcoming survivalist show, while James May recently launched his own cookery programme. ""I've still got one to do,"" Wilman says, although adds that he'll remain behind the scenes rather than on screen.

""We'd like to do two [Grand Tour specials] a year, that was the plan. We've still got two to do, on our current contract. And that's about right, two allows us to do other things, and keep Grand Tour going.""",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fully online degrees and certificates have become increasingly popular in recent years.

30,A $50m danger-filled restoration,[],"On 21 June 2017, Iraqi forces were nearing the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul. One of the Iraqi city‚Äôs most famous and iconic landmarks, the mosque had stood in this part of Mosul ‚Äì the Old City ‚Äì since Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zangi, a Turkic ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, oversaw its construction between 1172 and 1173. It was not only a place of worship, but a representation of the city‚Äôs rich diversity: of different religions, art, education and culture. The mosque stood strategically placed in the heart of the city, surrounded by a network of tangled walkways and medieval streets that converged towards the city gates.

In July 2014, this mosque was where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance in his first and only public appearance. Days earlier he‚Äôd declared his caliphate, giving birth to his ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù.

Three years later, at 21:50 on that June 2017 day ‚Äì a blink of an eye in its more than 800 years of history ‚Äì the mosque was destroyed by the jihadist group, yet more devastation in a devastated city. Iraqi forces were fighting to take the mosque in what would be a landmark victory and had reportedly advanced to within 50m of its walls when explosives were detonated from the inside.

The challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri ‚Äì and with it part of Mosul‚Äôs identity ‚Äì are far greater than a typical restoration

Around the world, news stations looked on as satellite imagery showed rubble strewn across the patch of land where the mosque once stood. ‚ÄúDaesh‚Äôs [Islamic State‚Äôs] bombing of the al-Hadba minaret and the al-Nuri mosque is a formal declaration of their defeat,‚Äù said the then-Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi at the time. But what was left in its place was destruction.

Daesh was forced from the city in July 2017 in what ended a period of warfare known as the battle for Mosul. Then, Mosul‚Äôs long recovery began.

The al-Nuri mosque remained in pieces until December 2019 when the campaign to rebuild it was launched, a $50.44m project financed by the United Arab Emirates. The project is one element of a wider Unesco initiative known as Revive the Spirit of Mosul. Launched in February 2018 through a partnership between the Prime Minister of Iraq Mustafa al-Kadhimi and the UN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres, the project aims to restore the urban, social and cultural fabric of the Old City, one where late Ottoman buildings stand alongside bustling bazaars and khans (traditional merchants‚Äô dwellings). The Great Mosque of al-Nuri was at the spiritual heart of the Old City, a complex of prayer halls and buildings that spread out over roughly 11,050sq m.

At the mosque‚Äôs centre was the al Hadba minaret, a famed tower that looked out across the city. Throughout the years the minaret developed a natural, albeit precarious, lean to one side. This quirk not only gave the city of Mosul the unofficial nickname of ‚Äúthe hunchback‚Äù but its image is emblazoned on the 10,000 Iraqi Dinar bank note alongside a portrait of ·∏§asan Ibn al-Haytham, a Basrah-born mathematician and key figure of the Islamic Golden Age. From the 8th to the 13th Century, this revolutionary era of literature, science, medicine and astronomy made what is modern-day Iraq the intellectual centre of the world.

One of the people heading the Revive the Spirit of Mosul project is Paolo Fontani, who took up the role of Director and Representative of Unesco Iraq in 2019. ‚ÄúWhen I was asked to take this position, I remember thinking how I would be grateful if one day someone came to help me rebuild my own hometown,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll the monuments, the places that have marked my existence and constructed who I am. My identity...‚Äù

But the challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri ‚Äì and with it part of Mosul‚Äôs identity ‚Äì are far greater than a typical restoration. Fontani and his team have to contend with a building that is almost 850 years old, and also one that toppled in a warzone.

For work to begin, it was vital to assess what damage had been done. Normally, surveyors would inspect the building and note what needed to be fixed, but there was a problem: the site was far too dangerous for any human to enter. So in the place of humans came drones. These drones, explained Maria Rita Acetoso, senior project officer on the al-Nuri mosque project, surveyed both horizontal surfaces like the roofs of single buildings and vertical ones like a minaret. As they did, a number of geo-referenced photos were taken and pieced together to create a 3D model. This allowed them to effectively fly throughout the wreckage to map every fallen ceiling, and to photograph the 45m-tall minaret in high definition with ease.

After that came stabilising the area, which meant approaching the rubble as a booby-trapped site. Hidden amidst the wreckage, a large arsenal of mines and unexploded devices littered the area. ‚ÄúThere were around 300 or 400 cases of TNT under there,‚Äù said Acetoso . ‚ÄúThere were even IEDs hidden in the walls.‚Äù

Securing the site was overseen by the Iraqi authorities, who disarmed each explosive device individually. For Acetoso, this posed the greatest challenge. ‚ÄúThe reconstruction of historical landmarks is always challenging, but the de-mining came with an unknown threat,‚Äù she said. In collaboration with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and the State Board of Antiquities, a team of eight archaeologists were able to salvage artworks and artefacts from amongst the rubble that had miraculously survived the blast. In total, 44,000 bricks and 1,100 fragments of marble were recovered from the mosque and its minaret, all of which were catalogued and will eventually decorate the place of worship once again.

Considerable time was spent deciding whether the minaret would be re-erected in its original form ‚Äì that is, how it looked 850 years ago, or with a tilt, as it was when it was destroyed. The minaret will keep its lean, but the task of rebuilding this plinth is much more difficult than deciding on its aesthetic.

The biggest concern is around the fact that the minaret is the most fragile element of the entire build. When the mosque was destroyed, the explosion caused a partial collapse of the upper base of the minaret‚Äôs eastern side, causing the structure to rotate significantly as it fell.

The starting point in salvaging this landmark is by assessing the current strength and stability of what is left, determining what can be saved and what has been lost. This begins by retrieving samples from the existing masonry through endoscopic investigation, where small holes are drilled into the masonry, which are then inspected with a camera. This technique helps inform on everything from the chemical-physical composition of the original materials used and the strength of the bricks themselves, to the exact constructive processes used in the 12th Century or in past renovation attempts. This, says Acetoso, will allow them to rebuild the mosque to near its original form.

The process has been long and arduous. The Covid pandemic has delayed work for most of 2020, and construction won‚Äôt fully conclude until 2023. The rebuilding of Mosul doesn‚Äôt begin and end with Unesco, however. More than 5,000 buildings were damaged in the Old City alone, while across Mosul, according to original government estimates from 2018, at least $2bn in aid is needed for the city to recover. Mosul itself still suffers with a lack of electricity, internet or provisions.

The site was far too dangerous for any human to enter

‚ÄúMany families returned to Mosul and saw their own houses, churches, mosques, libraries and museums all destroyed,‚Äù said Father Najeeb Michaeel, Christian Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul, who is in the process of rebuilding his St Paul‚Äôs church on Mosul‚Äôs east side, which remains heavily damaged from the war. ‚ÄúThat's why we‚Äôre working hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder to clean and rebuild Mosul. Not just in stone, but in spirit.‚Äù

The road will be long and difficult, but Mosul‚Äôs recovery is not achieved solely through bricks and mortar. It‚Äôs achieved in the return of culture to Mosul ‚Äì of music, arts, education and literature ‚Äì which is what built the city in the beginning and which is how its future will be drawn.

‚ÄúThey discovered the art of writing and reading here. This is our life. The origin of humanity,‚Äù said Father Najeeb. ‚ÄúThis is our culture.‚Äù

With the festive period fast approaching, governments are facing tough questions about whether to ease restrictions in time for Christmas. In France, the government has said it will relax its national lockdown in phases.

It decided religious services would be able to take place, providing a 30-person limit was enforced. But the country's highest court has ordered a review of this limit, after it was challenged. Religious leaders argued that churches and cathedrals were more spacious than most public spaces.

""The claimants are right in saying that the measure is disproportionate,"" a court statement said. ""Thus it is a serious and illegal infringement on the freedom of worship.""

The government has been given three days to modify the policy and take proportionate measures. Elsewhere in Europe:

Thousands of health workers have marched in the Spanish capital, Madrid, in support of the country's public health system. They called for an increase in funding to cope with the pressures of the pandemic

Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.

This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases ‚Äì people who do not have symptoms.

It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.

Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.

It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.

Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.

Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.

But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.

These tests were never intended for community use like this. When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases.

38,The psychology behind ‚Äòrevenge bedtime procrastination‚Äô,[],"The sleep ‚ÄòCatch-22‚Äô

Although people might resent work squeezing their leisure time, reducing sleep is probably not the best ‚Äòretaliation‚Äô. Sleep deprivation, especially long term, can lead to a host of harmful effects, both mental and physical. In Matthew Walker‚Äôs book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, the neuroscientist is blunt: ‚ÄúThe shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.‚Äù And people, in general, know this: everybody interviewed for this article felt their sleep patterns were unhealthy ‚Äì but they still kept late nights.

Psychology may explain the reason why people would choose to eke out this leisure time even at the expense of sleep. A growing body of evidence points to the importance of time away from work pressure; failure to detach can lead to stress, reduced wellbeing and burnout. ‚ÄúOne of the most important parts of recovery from work is sleep. However, sleep is affected by how well we detach,‚Äù says Sheffield University‚Äôs Kelly. It‚Äôs important, she explains, to have downtime when we can be mentally distanced from work, which would explain why people are willing to sacrifice sleep for post-work leisure.

‚ÄúPeople are stuck in a Catch-22 when they don‚Äôt have time to detach from their work before they go to sleep, it is likely to negatively affect their sleep,‚Äù says Kelly. The real solution, she suggests, is to ensure that individuals are allowed time to engage in activities that provide this detachment. However, this is often not something employees can achieve by themselves.

Heejung Chung, a labour sociologist at the University of Kent and an advocate for greater workplace flexibility, sees the practice of delaying sleep as the fault of employers. Tackling the problem would benefit workers but also help ensure a ‚Äúhealthy, efficient workplace‚Äù, she points out. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs actually a productivity measure,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou need that time to unwind. Workers need something to do other than work. It‚Äôs risky behaviour to do only one thing.‚Äù

Greater flexibility

Since the pandemic, companies in many nations have implemented work-from-home policies, introducing greater flexibility into working lives but also, in some cases, further blurring already tenuous boundaries between work and home. It‚Äôs not yet clear how this might affect the kind of work culture that leaves employees shunning sleep to claw back some free time.

Chung says that genuine change requires an institutional shift, across many companies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs difficult for individuals to react [to their work situation],‚Äù she says. But she does advise employees to talk to their colleagues and collectively approach their boss, with evidence, if they want to ask for change.

However, this might not be forthcoming in China. In fact, reports suggest that companies are digging in even more when it comes to overtime as they try to bounce back from losses caused by Covid-19. Krista Pederson, a consultant who works with multinationals and Chinese corporations from Beijing, says that she‚Äôs observed this trend. Chinese companies see their working culture as an advantage over markets like the US or Europe where people tend to work fewer hours: ‚ÄúThey know they have hard workers who are ruthless and will do whatever it takes to get ahead, including working all the time,‚Äù she says.

With such a demanding work culture, employees will keep on tackling the problem in a way that works for them. Despite burning the candle at both ends, Gu Bing loves her job and embraces her stolen leisure time. ‚ÄúSometimes, I really reckon night time is perfect, beautiful even,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMy friends and I, we converse at night and sometimes we write songs together. It‚Äôs quiet and peaceful.‚Äù

And there is the option, for the lucky ones, of changing jobs, which is what Emma Rao did, finally swapping her 996 job for a slightly less demanding one. However, Rao has found that old habits are hard to shake. ‚ÄúIt is a revenge,‚Äù she says of her late bedtimes. ‚ÄúTo get back some time for yourself.‚Äù",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,The ships powered by 'green hydrogen',[],"But the real challenge for using it in long-distance shipping is how tricky it is to store. Hydrogen cannot simply replace bunkering fuel in the current system. To store it on board a ship as a liquid, it needs to be frozen using cryogenic temperatures of -253C (-423F), says Hubatova. And even then, it takes up a lot of space ‚Äì around eight times more than the amount of marine gas oil needed to give the same amount of energy, according to EDF analysis.

The extra space needed by hydrogen has caused concern in the industry that it might need to clear out cargo to make room for the fuel. But an analysis from the ICCT has found that this barrier could be overcome. It found that 43% of current voyages between China and the United States ‚Äì one of the world‚Äôs busiest shipping lanes ‚Äì could be made using hydrogen without the need for cargo space or to stop more times to refuel. Nearly all the voyages could be powered by hydrogen with only minor changes to fuel capacity or operations, it found.

Ammonia alternative

Hydrogen is often used as a catch-all term for synthetic fuels, but many experts believe another option is actually better: using the green hydrogen to make green ammonia, another fuel which can be either combusted or used in a fuel cell. Ammonia is far easier to store than hydrogen (it needs refrigeration but not cryogenic temperatures), and takes up around half the space since it is far denser. It can also be converted back to hydrogen onboard a ship, meaning it could be loaded and stored on the ship as ammonia but ultimately used in a hydrogen fuel cell.

‚ÄúAt the moment, the best bet is to just turn [hydrogen] into ammonia, which is this ‚ÄòGoldilocks fuel‚Äô,‚Äù says Smith. ‚ÄúAmmonia is so much cheaper to store; you can store it at a pressurised tank, so you don't need to have any sort of cryogenics. It's only a small amount more expensive to make than hydrogen.‚Äù",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúWe are grateful that so far nobody is in the hospital,‚Äù Sister Maria Cordis Reiker said.

Local health authorities put the the entire monastery under quarantine late last week after the first cases of coronavirus were discovered there. Most Catholic nuns in Germany are elderly women because convents have had difficulties for decades recruiting young women for their cause.

Reiker said they were still waiting for the test results of the 160 non-clerical employees of the monastery, including nurses working at the monastery‚Äôs old people‚Äôs home, and others working at the monastery‚Äôs kitchen and wash house.

65,Boris Faces Massive Tory Rebellion over Coronavirus Restrictions,['Victoria Friedman'],"Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion of up to 100 Conservative MPs planning to vote against putting 99 per cent of England under the top two strictest coronavirus measures.

The prime minister‚Äôs proposals from last week revealed that despite England being under a month-long lockdown during November, more of the country will find itself in a higher tier coming out of shutdown than going in, with just Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in Tier 1.

Conservative MPs were outraged by the recommended demarcations, calling the measures ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù, with others saying that the ‚Äúwheels are coming off the government‚Äôs arguments‚Äù to continue imposing them.

14.6 million more people in England are now in Tier 3 compared to pre-lockdown, when cases were also falling.

Lockdowns don‚Äôt work. pic.twitter.com/wtNDkMJjli ‚Äî The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 29, 2020

MPs are set to vote on the measures in the House of Commons today, with media reporting that as many as between 50 and 100 Tories will rebel against their own government and vote against them, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.

The Guardian has also reported that Labour plans to abstain from voting, because the financial support, derived from taxpayers, for the hospitality industry must go further than the government‚Äôs recovery package.

Tier 2 bans socialising indoors with anyone outside their house or support bubble and limits it to six outdoors, while Tier 3 prohibits any mixing with people not in your household or bubble inside or in most outdoor settings. Tier 3 also sees pubs, bars, and restaurants close unless they can function as takeaways, while in Tier 2, alcohol at hospitality venues can only be served with a ‚Äòsubstantial meal‚Äô.

Conservative lockdown sceptics from the COVID Recovery Group won a minor battle in forcing the Johnson administration to release the impact assessments that informed the government‚Äôs decision, but MPs are said to be disappointed with the document, described as ‚Äúthin‚Äù and containing a ‚Äúrehashed‚Äù and frustrating analysis.

66,Tucker Carlson: ‚ÄòDr. Fauci Was Revealed as a Power-Mad Incompetent‚Äô,['Jeff Poor'],"Monday, Fox News Channel‚Äôs Tucker Carlson opened his program questioning the decisions of National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci, including closing down schools to children, a segment of the population that does not appear to be as vulnerable to the threat of COVID-19.

Carlson insisted Fauci could have intervened earlier and prevented Draconian measures from being taken with regards to coronavirus and education.

Transcript as follows:

CARLSON: I hope you had a great and relaxing Thanksgiving weekend, away from the endless drone of news. If you somehow managed to pull that off, a few days of peace and happiness with the ones you love, you found it was like a spa treatment. You‚Äôre obviously better off for it.

But you also may be wondering what happened? What did you miss over the weekend? And we‚Äôre here to tell you.

For starters, Joe Biden broke his foot in a couple of places. It sounds serious, but don‚Äôt worry about it. Biden was just out playing with his dog as healthy, vibrant adults in full command of their faculties are not at all fragile and fading often do. It could have happened to anyone. Seriously, it‚Äôs totally normal.

CNN, in fact, wrote a piece congratulating Biden for it. Biden‚Äôs injuries are far better than Donald Trump‚Äôs. So don‚Äôt ask questions. You‚Äôve got bigger stories to worry about in the news landscape.

For example, did you hear that Joe Biden picked women to lead the White House Communications Office? That was a historic moment. Nothing like that has happened in this country since the presidency of Donald Trump. Another triumph for the forces of identity. Systemic sexism finally in retreat. Nothing can stop Joe Biden from smashing the glass ceiling, not even his dog.

So that‚Äôs what you missed.

Oh, and one other thing. The country‚Äôs public health establishment has tortured your children for eight months for no apparent reason. That happened. That story has not received a lot of coverage, but it has been confirmed tonight. The authorities have admitted 60 million American children languishing in their rooms since spring, sitting in front of screens, learning nothing, isolated from human contact, in many cases driven to mental illness.

We can now report there was no reason for any of that. The experts were wrong. They had no idea what they were doing. But the most amazing part ‚Äî and this really is the headline of the story ‚Äî is that they knew they were wrong when they did it. But they kept lying about it, even as American children began to kill themselves.

On Sunday in New York, city officials all but admitted this. They announced the reopening of elementary schools. Those are the same schools that they closed fewer than two weeks ago. Now, from a medical standpoint, nothing has changed. New York didn‚Äôt get an early shipment of the Pfizer vaccine. There wasn‚Äôt some groundbreaking new research paper that revolutionized our understanding of the coronavirus, nothing like that at all.

In fact, parents simply had enough and they forced Bill de Blasio to admit the obvious. This virus is not a threat to children. As de Blasio put it in that weird euphemistic way that dumb people speak, quote, ‚ÄúWe know that the health realities for the youngest kids are the most favorable.‚Äù Well, yes, we do know that. We‚Äôve known it for a long time. We knew it when Bill de Blasio shut down New York schools.

And Tony Fauci knew it, too, though he didn‚Äôt say anything about it. Now, he has decided to say something about it eight months late. Here‚Äôs Anthony Fauci on Sunday. And as you watch this, keep in mind that this man on the screen is leading our response, America‚Äôs response to the coronavirus.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Close the bars and keep the schools open is what we really say. Obviously, you don‚Äôt have one size fits all. But as I‚Äôve said in the past, and as you accurately quoted me, the default position should be to try as best as possible within reason to keep the children in school or to get them back to school.

If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not really very big at all. Not like one would have suspected.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Oh, I‚Äôve always said you should keep the schools open says the man in charge of America‚Äôs coronavirus response to a nation whose schools have been closed for months. Right. Yes, I always said that. Check the tape. Because, quote, ‚ÄúIf you look at the data,‚Äù says Anthony Fauci.

But wait a second. Why is this just now occurring to Tony Fauci? Isn‚Äôt this Fauci‚Äôs entire job to quote, ‚Äúlook at the data‚Äù? Yes, it is. And yet somehow he never thought to do that. That‚Äôs our corona czar.

Over the summer when the data look the same as they do tonight, Fauci explained that he couldn‚Äôt really say, if kids should be allowed to go to school, it was quote, ‚Äúcomplicated.‚Äù Except it wasn‚Äôt complicated. It wasn‚Äôt complicated then, it‚Äôs not complicated now.

In April, many months ago, a study by the ‚ÄúJournal of the American Medical Association‚Äù found that school-aged children who get the coronavirus, quote, ‚ÄúDevelop only mild symptoms and typically recover within two weeks.‚Äù Months later, same story, in June, a study in ‚ÄúThe Lancet‚Äù affirmed this, quote, ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is generally a mild disease in children, including in infants.‚Äù Other studies found the exact same thing. No studies found anything but that. There was never much question about it.

But if you‚Äôre looking for more evidence, check the death rates. Those are publicly available. Deaths are not hard to track. Consider the State of New Jersey. That‚Äôs one of the states hit hardest by the coronavirus. So far in New Jersey, not a single school-aged child has died from the coronavirus, not one. Many children have died from car accidents and fires and drug ODs and suicide. None have died from COVID-19.

In California, the biggest state in the United States, 40 million people live there, a total of two people under the age of 18 have died from the coronavirus ‚Äî two. The numbers nationwide according to the latest C.D.C. numbers, 123 Americans under the age of 18 have died from the coronavirus, 123 out of 350 million.

We shut the schools anyway, crushing millions of kids, affecting their futures in ways we can‚Äôt even understand at this point. But it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs bad. Really bad in some cases.

So the question is, why did we do this? And the answer is to save the teachers. The teachers unions pushed this and their servants in the Democratic Party obey. They‚Äôre the single largest donors to the Democratic Party, so of course they did.

So unionized teachers get to stay home collecting checks, while you‚Äôre losing your jobs because classrooms are just too dangerous. It‚Äôs like the Battle of the Bulge five days a week. And that‚Äôs exactly what they‚Äôve done.

But what does the data say about this? Well, for teachers under the age of 50, and that‚Äôs the vast majority of them, the odds of surviving a coronavirus infection are roughly 99.98 percent. But we should tell you that for teachers under 70, the risk of dying escalates to a terrifying 99.5 percent chance of survival. And by the way, teachers do get sick, it likely won‚Äôt be from teaching. Children appear not to spread the coronavirus, surely not effectively. We‚Äôve done this for a long time.

Back in May, researchers in Europe found, quote, ‚ÄúChildren do not appear to be drivers of transmission. And we argue that reopening schools should be considered safe accompanied by certain measures.‚Äù Again, none of this is new. Tony Fauci, that data guy knew it at the time. And so did anyone in the news media who could read which is still most of them, and yet they kept lying about it, all of them.

In July, here is just one example, a panel of physicians and experts on infectious disease went on television to explain that going to school isn‚Äôt dangerous for anyone, they would send their own kids. Watch the news anchors‚Äô reaction.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Would you let your kids go back to school?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will. My kids are looking forward to it.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Period. Absolutely.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Absolutely. As much as I can.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Without hesitation?

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Without hesitation. Yes.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have no concerns about sending my child to school in the fall.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I would let my kids go back to school.

JOHN TORRES, NBC NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Dr. John Torres, NBC News.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They all said yes.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: ‚ÄúThey all said yes,‚Äù says the newsreader, feigning shock. Can you believe that? Doctors have concluded their own children should go to school. They must be crazy. They are crazy. What do doctors know about coronavirus?

What was this about? And of course, you know the answer. It was about Donald Trump.

Donald Trump in this case agreed with the doctors. Therefore, the doctors had to be mocked and ignored. Here‚Äôs what the President said about schools in July.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We have to open our schools. Open our schools. Stop this nonsense. We open our schools.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: ‚ÄúStop this nonsense. We reopen our schools.‚Äù Now in point of fact, as a scientific matter that turned out to be sound policy based on sound data. But the media told us the exact opposite of that. One headline at CNN warned of, quote, ‚ÄúThe very clear dangers of Donald Trump‚Äôs push to reopen schools.‚Äù Google didn‚Äôt censor that as misinformation, it should have.

Another headline called out, quote, ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äôs mind-bending logic on school reopenings.‚Äù Mind-bending logic. Those damn data again, Joe Biden‚Äôs campaign didn‚Äôt want to hear it. They didn‚Äôt want you to hear it either. School was dangerous. Period.

Donald Trump claimed the opposite. Therefore, it was too dangerous to send your kids or for you to decide to send them. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Ignoring how the virus spreads, risking teachers and parents‚Äô lives, going against the advice of experts.

TRUMP: It‚Äôs had very little impact on young people.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you trust him to do what‚Äôs best for our children? Because this is not a test.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Yes, going against the advice of experts. In this country, that‚Äôs no longer allowed, even and maybe especially when the experts are completely wrong. What‚Äôs the message? The message couldn‚Äôt be clearer. They‚Äôre not your kids anymore. If they were your kids, you could make the key decisions about their lives, but they‚Äôre not.

Those kids, your former kids belong to Tony Fauci now. Tony Fauci, America‚Äôs parent. He‚Äôll make the decisions about your kids, thank you very much, in conjunction with the nation‚Äôs uber mom, who by the way, is also 80 years old, Mrs. Nancy D. Pelosi.

Watch Mrs. Pelosi fret about the health of our children.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: Are you confident that students and teachers will go back safely to school in the fall?

REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): No, I think what we heard from the Secretary was malfeasance and dereliction of duty. This is appalling. They‚Äôre messing. They‚Äôre messing ‚Äî the President and his administration are messing with the health of our children.

Going back to school presents the biggest risk for the spread of the coronavirus.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: If that‚Äôs not criminal, what she just said, we may need to redefine what it means to commit a crime. Sixty million school-aged children affected by a decision that was wrong and many of them hurt for life, but we just blow right past it and allow political leaders like that to blow right past with phrases like the health of our children.

What happens when you lock children in their rooms in front of screens and prevent them from experiencing human contact? Has Nancy Pelosi ever been asked that question? Has she ever wondered about the answer?

According to the Centers for Disease Control, a total of 522 children between the ages of five and 14 died of suicide in 2017. And that same age group, only 42 children have died from the coronavirus so far this year. What are those suicide numbers going to look like if we continue to take Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs advice about the health of our children? We‚Äôre going to have some indications of that. Future years will reveal the whole picture and you can be certain it‚Äôll be horrifying.

But for right now, with incomplete data, here‚Äôs what we know. In St. Paul, Minnesota, for example, 40 percent of all grades given this year have been Fs, and you can be certain they are grading lightly, but it‚Äôs still double the normal amount of failures.

In Fairfax County, Virginia, the number of middle and high school students with failing grades in two or more classes has increased by 83 percent. The number of students with disabilities who are failing two or more classes has increased by more than 100 percent.

In a lot of school districts, huge numbers of kids never even registered for online classes. Do you have kids? Do you know anyone who does? They are learning nothing. Those are real consequences.

If you want to know the health of a society, look at its young people. Look at its schools. These are obvious points that are being roundly ignored and anyone who makes them is attacked for making them. We‚Äôre going to look back on this woman in shame.

Back in June, we interviewed Dr. Scott Atlas. He was then a member of the White House‚Äôs Coronavirus Taskforce. He was one of the very few people then or now brave enough to make a simple point. Here‚Äôs what he said.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DR. SCOTT ATLAS, FORMER MEMBER OF WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASKFORCE: But the point about the schools is really critical because this is the most irrational public policy probably in modern history. Children have virtually zero-risk of getting a serious complication, virtually zero risk of dying. You don‚Äôt lock down the children because you are personally afraid. It is totally outrageous.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: Dr. Scott Atlas was attacked as a monster for saying that. Really attacked. Dr. Tony Fauci, by contrast, was deified. Signs throughout Northwest DC said I believe, Dr. Fauci, but the truth is that Scott Atlas was right and Dr. Fauci was revealed as a power-mad incompetent.

That‚Äôs not our opinion, by the way, the data prove it.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
67,David Mamet Calls Out ‚ÄòExperts‚Äô and Questions Lockdowns: ‚ÄòThe Virus Here Is Government‚Äô,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

‚ÄúThe virus here is government‚Äîor at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,‚Äù Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence‚Äîand they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ ‚Äî WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

‚ÄúWe all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.‚Äù

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. ‚ÄúOne is ‚Äòpermitted‚Äô to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?‚Äù

David Mamet compares today‚Äôs coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin‚Äôs science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. ‚ÄúNow we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe news media, backed by those parts of the ‚Äòscientific community‚Äô the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.‚Äù

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

‚ÄúA pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.‚Äù

68,Coronavirus Robs Biblical Bethlehem of Christmas Cheer,['Breitbart News'],"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) ‚Äî The coronavirus has cast a pall over Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem, all but shutting down the biblical town revered as Jesus‚Äô birthplace at the height of the normally cheery holiday season.

Missing are the thousands of international pilgrims who normally descend upon the town. Restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops are closed. The renowned Christmas tree lighting service will be limited to a small group of authorized people, as will church services on Christmas Eve.

‚ÄúBethlehem is dead,‚Äù said Maryana al-Arja, owner of the 120-room Angel Hotel on the outskirts of Bethlehem.

The hotel was the site of the West Bank‚Äôs first coronavirus outbreak ‚Äî when a group of Greek tourists came down with the virus last March.

She kept her 25 workers on staff for several months but ultimately couldn‚Äôt continue to pay them. Al-Arja, who herself was infected with the virus, said she has been forced to close the hotel and lay off the entire staff because there is no sign of the pandemic ending or tourists visiting anytime soon.

‚ÄúWe had 351 tourist groups booked in our hotel this year, each one 150 people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut they all canceled.‚Äù

Elyas al-Arja, the head of the city‚Äôs hotel association, said Bethlehem received some 3 million tourists in 2019. With Israel, the main entry point for international visitors to the region, banning tourists because of the coronavirus crisis, and the West Bank‚Äôs border crossing with Jordan closed to foreigners, that number is close to zero this year, he said.

‚ÄúSixty percent of the city relies on tourism, and their income disappeared when the tourists disappeared,‚Äù said al-Arja, a cousin of the Angel Hotel owner.

The Ambassador Hotel, which is located near the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, has reopened one floor in hopes that some local visitors may want to come celebrate in the coming weeks.

Mahmoud Tarman, the hotel‚Äôs receptionist, said the Ambassador has brought back eight of its 60 workers to serve local guests. But with the West Bank‚Äôs economy devastated by repeated lockdowns, it remains unclear how many people will come.

‚ÄúAt this time of the year, this empty hotel would be bustling with life. But as you see, there is no life, not even a Christmas tree yet,‚Äù he said as he pointed at the empty lobby.

The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, this week imposed a new nighttime lockdown to help contain a spike in coronavirus cases. People must remain indoors from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m., and Bethlehem is included in the lockdown.

Officials say the lockdown could be extended through Christmas and into the new year if the infection levels don‚Äôt come down. The Health Ministry has reported a total of about 65,000 coronavirus cases in the West Bank, and over 620 deaths.

Bethlehem‚Äôs mayor, Anton Salman, said the city had planned to receive 3,000 invited guests, including local scout troops and musical bands from around the world that normally entertain visitors during Christmas Eve festivities.

He said the famed Christmas tree lighting, scheduled on Thursday, will be limited to just 15 guests, including local mayors, the district governor and the Latin Patriarch and other clergy. The 85-year-old Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who usually joins the celebration, has been invited but has not said whether he will attend.

Midnight Mass, a solemn event led by the Latin Patriarch that is usually attended by religious leaders, local VIPs and hundreds of pilgrims from around the world, has also been scaled back, Salman said. He said officials are still working on the guest list, but it is expected to include religious leaders and some foreign diplomats. The event will be closed to the general public but broadcast live for people to watch.

‚ÄúNo one can hold the responsibility of inviting large numbers of people to Christmas events,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNothing will be the same during the pandemic.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
69,SF Archbishop Says New Church Closures Violate Religious Freedom,['Thomas D. Williams'],"San Francisco Archbishop Salvatore Cordileone said this weekend a new ban on worship violates a ‚Äúa natural and a Constitutional right.‚Äù

Archbishop Cordileone objected to the state‚Äôs lumping together of religious worship with ‚Äúnon-essential indoor activities such as gyms, movie theaters, and museums‚Äù while arbitrarily allowing ‚Äúfor indoor retail at 25 percent capacity and permits massage parlors, hair and nail salons, and tattoo parlors to operate indoors.‚Äù

In his statement, the archbishop criticized a new health order from the state of California that places San Francisco and San Mateo Counties into a more restrictive ‚Äúpurple‚Äù tier of coronavirus restrictions, which unfairly denigrates the right to religious worship.

‚ÄúThis is precisely the kind of blatant discrimination to which the Supreme Court gave injunctive relief in New York,‚Äù Cordileone said, in reference to last Wednesday‚Äôs SCOTUS ruling barring the state from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship.

Even in a pandemic, ‚Äúthe Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,‚Äù Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 5-4 decision. ‚ÄúThe restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment‚Äôs guarantee of religious liberty.‚Äù

England‚Äôs faith leaders have united in calling on the UK government to permit public worship during the forthcoming lockdown in England, insisting that such worship is ‚Äúessential.‚Äù https://t.co/FohO0VnRAE ‚Äî Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 3, 2020

The San Francisco archbishop insisted in his statement that for Catholic Christians, worship of God and the reception of the sacraments are ‚Äúessential‚Äù activities.

‚ÄúThe government is demoting worship to the same status as watching a movie: ‚Äònon-essential,‚Äô‚Äù Cordileone said. ‚ÄúBut worship is both a natural and a Constitutional right. My people want to receive the Body and Blood of Christ; they need it, and have every right to be free to do so.‚Äù

Cordileone also insisted that his archdiocese has adhered scrupulously to measures mandated to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

‚ÄúCatholics in San Francisco are absolutely committed to public safety in conducting worship services,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur protocols require masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the government still chooses to treat worship as less important than shopping for shoes,‚Äù he added.

While declaring that he is ‚Äúdeeply sympathetic to public health concerns about a surge in COVID hospitalizations,‚Äù the archbishop also noted that ‚Äúwe know of no cases of transmission of the virus as a result of in-person worship inside of our churches.‚Äù

70,Defiant French Priests Break Lockdown Rules to Keep Churches Open,['Chris Tomlinson'],"Lille priests are rejecting the French government‚Äôs Wuhan coronavirus restrictions by allowing more than 30 parishioners in their churches at one time.

The archbishop of Lille, Laurent Ulrich, spoke out against the government‚Äôs restrictions, calling them ‚Äúarbitrary, discriminatory and unrealistic‚Äù, and told the priests under him to ‚Äúwelcome all believers‚Äù into their churches.

On Sunday, shortly before mass at the Notre-Dame de la Treille Cathedral, Father Bruno Mary commented on the situation, saying: ‚ÄúWe are not outlaws, we are just trying to be intelligent.‚Äù

‚ÄúMonsignor Ulrich told us to do what we could with respect for sanitary measures,‚Äù he added, according to 20 minutes.

French Catholics Gather to Protest Church Closures Under Lockdown https://t.co/fOM699igck ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 16, 2020

Father Mary said that he and his colleagues took in multiple groups of 30 people into the church, which typically holds around 1,200 people. ‚ÄúWe organise ourselves as best we can, taking into account vulnerable people,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe understand that the government is focused on the economy. People have to live. But churches are places of comfort that people need right now,‚Äù Father Mary said.

Over the weekend, the French Council of State, France‚Äôs highest administrative court, ordered the government to reexamine the restrictions on churches within three days, after arguing that they were ‚Äúdisproportionate‚Äù.

‚ÄúIf some establishments remain open to the public, [such as cinemas or theatres,] while places of worship remained closed, the activities carried out there are not of the same nature, and the fundamental freedoms that are at stake are not the same,‚Äù the Council of State said, rationalising that the freedom to worship has a different status and requires special protection under the law.

The Council of State‚Äôs order comes after several protests in early November by Christians outside of churches across the country after the government of President Emmanuel Macron introduced the 30-parishioner limit.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in various cities, including as many as 600 in Versailles and 400 in Nantes over a single weekend.

‚ÄúWe follow protocols, there has not been an outbreak of contamination in churches to my knowledge. We want to assert our right to Mass. This is a matter of freedom of religion,‚Äù one protester said.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bill Melugin of local Fox affiliate KTTV-11 reported Monday:

During Tuesday‚Äôs L.A.

74,Donald Trump Coronavirus Adviser Scott Atlas Resigns,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump‚Äôs special adviser for the coronavirus pandemic, Scott Atlas, resigned in a letter published on Monday.

Atlas joined the White House in August as a Special Government Employee, which has a 130-day detail limit that will expire this week.

‚ÄúI thank you for the honor and privilege to serve on behalf of the American people since August, during these difficult months for our nation,‚Äù Atlas wrote in the resignation letter that he posted on Twitter.

The news was first reported by Fox News reporter Brooke Singman.

Atlas offered the president a different perspective than many of the bureaucratic federal scientists and officials who put the country in a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus.

‚Äú[P]erhaps More than anything, my advice was always focused on minimizing all the harms from both the pandemic and the structural policies themselves, especially to the working class and the poor,‚Äù Atlas wrote.

Atlas said he was honored to serve in the White House and celebrated the success of Operation Warp Speed developing a vaccine in record time.

‚ÄúThroughout my time at the White House, it was an honor to work with several selfless colleagues in designing specific policies to heighten protection of the vulnerable while safely reopening schools and society,‚Äù he wrote.

Atlas was treated poorly by the corporate media, especially when his advice conflicted with Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Centers for Disease Control Dr. Robert Redfield, who bristled at some his recommendations.

Facui said he had ‚Äúreal problems‚Äù with some of Atlas‚Äôs recommendations, and Redfield panned Atlas in a phone conversation that ‚Äúeverything he says is false.‚Äù

Atlas alluded to the struggle in his resignation letter, reasserting the importance of scientific debate.

‚ÄúAlthough some may disagree with those recommendations, it is the free exchange of ideas that lead to scientific truths, which are the very foundation of any civilized society,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIndeed, I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent.‚Äù

76,Articles of Impeachment Filed Against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A total of 12 articles of impeachment have officially been filed against Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine over abuse of power during the Chinese coronavirus pandemic.

Ohio State Rep. John Becker (R) was joined by Representatives Candice Keller (R), Nino Vitale (R), and Paul Zeltwanger (R) in filing articles of impeachment against Governor DeWine, according to a report by Cleveland 19 News.

The representatives argue that DeWine has abused his power during the pandemic, noting that the governor vetoed Senate Bill 55 ‚Äî and threatened to veto other General Assembly legislation, including Senate Bill 311 ‚Äî which seeks to severely limit the governor‚Äôs power during a pandemic.

‚ÄúGovernor DeWine‚Äôs mismanagement, malfeasance, misfeasance, abuse of power, and other crimes include, but are not limited to, meddling in the conduct of a presidential primary election, arbitrarily closing and placing curfews on certain businesses, while allowing other businesses to remain open,‚Äù said Rep. Becker‚Äôs office in a statement.

‚ÄúHe weaponized the Ohio Bureau of Workers‚Äô Compensation to bully and harass businesses and the people; to enforce a statewide mask mandate and other controversial measures of dubious ‚Äòvalue,‚Äô making Ohio a hostile work environment,‚Äù the statement added.

The statement goes on to cite the governor‚Äôs inclusion of places of worship during shutdown orders, as well as the implementation a statewide mask mandate, which has been in effect in one way or another since the summer.

‚ÄúRather than hearing the cries of Ohioans, Governor DeWine continues to stifle those cries by finding more inventive ways to use masks to muffle the voices of the people,‚Äù said Rep. Becker in his statement.

‚ÄúHe continues to have callous disregard for the fact that his isolation policies have led to a shockingly high number of suicides, alarming rates of drug abuse, persistently high unemployment, and the forced abandonment of the elderly by their loved ones,‚Äù the representative added.

Becker first announced his decision to file articles of impeachment against DeWine in August, citing the same issues.

Makary said, ‚ÄúThe review committee is not interviewing subjects and volunteers. They‚Äôre not looking under a microscope at the cells or the virus.

Newsom said that the state had reached a ‚Äútipping point,‚Äù and that with the continued increase in hospitalizations due to the disease, the state could run out of hospital beds by Christmas.

This is the tipping point. CA has worked hard to prepare for a surge‚Äîbut we can‚Äôt sustain the record high cases we‚Äôre seeing. Current projections show CA will run out of current ICU beds before Christmas Eve. Please stay safe & stay home as much as you can for next few weeks. pic.twitter.com/5NJYzHokhE ‚Äî Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 30, 2020

The Los Angeles Times reported:

Of particular concern is the state‚Äôs intensive care capacity. Currently, about 75% of the state‚Äôs 7,733 ICU beds are occupied ‚Äî with 1,812 of them filled by coronavirus patients. Unless things change, the state could exhaust its existing ICU capacity by mid-December, according to projections Newsom presented. ‚ÄúIf these trends continue, we‚Äôre going to have to take much more dramatic ‚Äî arguably drastic ‚Äî actions,‚Äù he said during a briefing. Those include ‚Äúthe potential for a stay-at-home order‚Äù for areas in the strictest purple tier of California‚Äôs coronavirus reopening road map, he said. Of the state‚Äôs 58 counties, 51 are in the purple tier.

The state‚Äôs ‚Äúpurple tier‚Äù counties are already under a month-long, 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.

State and local officials are particularly worried about coronavirus spikes over the holidays. In Los Angeles County, officials have prohibited outdoor dining at restaurants and imposed new restrictions on business capacity.

In more positive news, Newsom tweeted that California will receive 327,000 doses of Pfizer‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine by mid-December.

79,Ravens-Steelers Rescheduled Again by COVID-19 to Wednesday,[],"The Baltimore Ravens‚Äô struggle to contain an extended outbreak of the coronavirus forced their rescheduled game Tuesday night against the unbeaten Pittsburgh Steelers to be moved back to Wednesday.

It‚Äôs the third fix to a matchup originally slated to be played Thanksgiving night.

The NFL announced the most recent switch Monday after the Ravens placed starters Matthew Judon, Willie Snead and Mark Andrews on the reserve/COVID-19 list.

Although Baltimore also had four players return from that list, the team will still be severely short-handed when this game is finally played.

The addition of Judon, a standout linebacker, and Andrews, the leading receiver on the team, brings to seven the number of 2019 Pro Bowl players that Baltimore has placed on the COVID-19 list over the past week.

Cornerback Terrell Bonds, who‚Äôs on injured reserve, was also added to the expansive list Monday.

There was a bit of good news, however: Baltimore activated linebacker Jayson Ferguson, offensive lineman D.J. Fluker and defensive tackle Broderick Washington from the COVID-19 list. Defensive back Iman Marshall was also activated, although he‚Äôs been on IR since tearing his right ACL in August.

The contest pitting two longtime rivals was originally scheduled for Thanksgiving night before a rash of coronavirus cases among the Ravens forced the game to be postponed to Sunday. As Baltimore continued to stack up positive tests, the game was moved back to Tuesday night.

Now, perhaps, they‚Äôll finally meet on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. Or not.

The Ravens (6-4) will face the Steelers without several of their top playmakers, including quarterback Lamar Jackson, running backs Mark Ingram and J.K. Dobbins, and defensive linemen Calais Campbell and Brandon Williams.

The loss of Andrews and Snead will further hinder backup quarterback Robert Griffin III, who will be taking snaps from a third-string center after Patrick Mekari and Matt Skura were placed on the COVID-19 list on Wednesday.

Andrews is a Type-1 diabetic, which makes COVID-19 potentially more dangerous. His loss should have an impact in that he leads Baltimore in receptions (38), yards receiving (454) and touchdown catches (6).

Andrews, Judon, Jackson, Ingram, Campbell, fullback Patrick Ricard and long snapper Morgan Cox were all selected to the Pro Bowl last season. Jackson, of course, was the NFL‚Äôs MVP in 2019.

Judon owns Baltimore‚Äôs franchise tag. He is tied for the team lead with four sacks and has 34 tackles.

Snead has 17 catches for 230 yards and two touchdowns over the past four games.

The NFL‚Äôs last Wednesday game was the 2012 season opener between the Giants and the Cowboys, which was moved from a Thursday night because of a conflict with the Democratic National Convention, which was scheduled to have President Barack Obama speak on Thursday night.

‚ÄúWe understand that every team is going through something like this,‚Äù Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward said. ‚ÄúNot to this extent, but we have to be ready for any situation. I think (coach Mike Tomlin) has laid out the plan. It‚Äôs up for us to follow it and it‚Äôs up for us to bounce back with it.‚Äù

Added Steelers tackle Zach Banner, who was injured in the season opener: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be healthy by the time we play this game.‚Äù

Still to be decided is when the scheduled Week 13 game between the Steelers and Washington will be played. It is currently set for Sunday at Heinz Field. Baltimore is supposed to host Dallas on Dec. 7.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
80,Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Says School Must Remain Open,['Joshua Caplan'],"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Monday said that schools are required to remain open for in-person learning in the spring as the state continues to battle the coronavirus.

WEAR-TV reports:

[The schools] will also continue to offer virtual options, although there will be stricter monitoring requirements in virtual classes. When it comes to virtual classes, the new rules will require parents to be notified if the student is struggling with virtual learning. Transitions to in-person learning may then be made, unless a parent objects.

‚ÄúClosing schools due to coronavirus is probably the biggest blunder in modern American history,‚Äù DeSantis told reporters.

‚ÄúPeople who advocate closing schools for virus mitigation are effectively today‚Äôs flat-Earthers, they have no scientific or evidence support for their position,‚Äù he added.

Florida is experiencing a rise in coronavirus cases with 990,000 confirmed infections since the pandemic started.

DeSantis‚Äôs comments come after the governor extended his order barring local governments from imposing mask mandates.

‚ÄúJust as an act of executive grace, all outstanding fines and penalties that have been applied against individuals are suspended,‚Äù DeSantis said last week.

‚ÄúI think we need to get away from trying to penalize people for not social distancing and work with people constructively,‚Äù he added.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
81,49ers to Play 2 Upcoming Home Games in Arizona,[],"The San Francisco 49ers will play two home games in Arizona after new coronavirus regulations put in place by officials in Northern California forced the team to find a temporary new home.

The 49ers (5-6) will host the Buffalo Bills next Monday night and Washington on Dec. 13 at State Farm Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals, because they won‚Äôt be able to practice or play games in their home in Santa Clara County for three weeks.

The team said it will have information on practice arrangements later but it will likely need to look outside the area because the rules imposed by Santa Clara County will require the players to quarantine for 14 days any time they travel more than 150 miles.

Niners CEO Jed York said the team had offers from San Diego and Arizona but playing at the Cardinals‚Äô home proved to be the best option. He thanked Cardinals owner Michael Bidwell and the officials in Arizona for their help in ‚Äúthese unprecedented times.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Cardinals organization, State Farm Stadium and League officials have been supportive and accommodating as we work through the many logistical issues involved in relocating NFL games,‚Äù the 49ers said in a statement.

Santa Clara County announced rules Saturday that include a three-week ban on practices and games for contact sports starting Monday. The Niners were on a plane getting ready to travel to Los Angeles, where they beat the Rams 23-20 on Sunday, when the players and coaches heard about the rules.

Now they will likely head on an even longer road trip while trying to make a late-season playoff run. San Francisco is currently one game out of a playoff spot.

‚ÄúThe biggest thing for me is us all leaving our families,‚Äù coach Kyle Shanahan said after the game. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all human just like everyone else. It‚Äôs a big deal to leave your family for the whole month of December. A huge deal, as everyone knows. This virus is a huge deal.‚Äù

Shanahan said it was ‚Äúextremely disappointing‚Äù the players and coaches learned about the new rules on social media as they were on the plane.

The county said the dramatic rise in cases required ‚Äúquick action‚Äù and that the priority was making sure there is enough hospital space to deal with the coronavirus and any other health issues.

‚ÄúThe 49ers are one of the thousands of organizations impacted by our most recent actions,‚Äù the county said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe County of Santa Clara has been in regular communication with the 49ers both before and after the announcement of the revised mandatory directive affecting all contact sports. We continue to do everything we can to support the 49ers, as well as all local businesses, affected communities, and families impacted by the pandemic.‚Äù

The Niners have road games scheduled at Dallas on Dec. 20 and then again on Dec. 26 at their temporary home in Arizona against the Cardinals.

They finish the season with a home game against Seattle on Jan. 3, which could be played at Levi‚Äôs Stadium if the ban is lifted as scheduled Dec. 21.

‚ÄúWe just got to have that open mind and positive attitude and make sure that first and foremost that everybody‚Äôs safe,‚Äù said running back Raheem Mostert, whose wife gave birth to the couple‚Äôs second child during the season back home in the Cleveland area. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the main goal.‚Äù

The AFC East-leading Bills (8-3) return to Arizona for the second time in a little over three weeks, following a heartbreaking 32-30 loss to the Cardinals. The game was decided by DeAndre Hopkins‚Äô leaping catch of Kyler Murray‚Äôs 43-yard touchdown pass with two seconds left.

The catch was immediately dubbed the ‚ÄúHail Murray,‚Äù and came 32 seconds after Buffalo pulled ahead on Stefon Diggs‚Äô 21-yard touchdown reception. Buffalo squandered a 23-9 lead before heading into its bye week.

The Bills are coming off a 27-17 win over the Los Angeles Chargers.

The rules also will impact the San Jose Sharks of the NHL and college teams at Stanford and San Jose State.

There is no start date yet for NHL training camp but some Sharks players have been taking part in voluntary rehabilitation and training in a socially distanced setting at the team‚Äôs facility in San Jose. The team said those will have to be modified to comply with the health order.

‚ÄúWe are reviewing what options may be available locally to allow these players to receive rehabilitation treatment and continue their training for the upcoming season,‚Äù the team said in a statement.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
82,Andrew Cuomo Tells Hospitals to Recruit Retired Doctors 'NOW',['Amy Furr'],"New York is preparing to recruit retired doctors and nurses to staff hospitals dealing with a surge in coronavirus cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said Monday.

The governor called it a ‚Äúnew phase in the war against COVID [Chinese coronavirus],‚Äù according to the New York Post, adding that daily hospitalizations across the state are almost quadruple what they were in June.

Cuomo said every hospital in New York must compile a list of retired doctors and nurses they can call on because of staffing problems in some areas.

‚ÄúI am very worried about staff shortages. I‚Äôm more concerned about the staff shortage than I am the [number of hospital] beds. We can build beds. We can‚Äôt create more staff. And the staff is starting tired,‚Äù he explained.

In a tweet Monday morning, the governor shared an infographic titled Initiate Emergency Hospital Procedures, with the first point reading, ‚ÄúStaff shortage: identify retired nurses and doctors NOW‚Äù:

We are laser-focused on ensuring enough hospital capacity as COVID surges. Today @HealthNYGov is initiating emergency hospital measures. Hospitals are directed to identify retired staff, make plans to add 50% bed capacity, confirm they have a 90-day PPE stockpile, and more. pic.twitter.com/6XzF4jXFxY ‚Äî Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 30, 2020

In a subsequent post, Cuomo told residents to stop attending small gatherings immediately.

‚ÄúHospitalizations are climbing ‚Äî statewide. What can you do? Cut out the small gatherings. Now. 65% of all cases are traced to small gatherings. Gov‚Äôt can‚Äôt enforce who‚Äôs in your living room. But you can,‚Äù he wrote.

As his state prepares to go into another lockdown that could put thousands out of work, Cuomo accepted his International Emmy Award last week by claiming victory and saying his press conferences offered ‚Äúauthentic truth and stability,‚Äù according to Breitbart News.

‚ÄúIn what became a Cuomo love-in for the so-called ‚ÄòLove Gov,‚Äô a chorus of celebrities joined in to sing the governor‚Äôs praises,‚Äù the report continued:

Absent from the ceremony was any mention of Gov. Cuomo‚Äôs March directive ordering New York nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, which caused the virus to spread like wild fire among that state‚Äôs elderly and infirm population.

83,El Paso Mayor Attributes Coronavirus Spike to Shopping at Large Retailers,['Hannah Bleau'],"El Paso Mayor Dee Margo (R) is attributing the recent spike in cases of the Chinese coronavirus to individuals shopping at large retailers during a Sunday appearance on CBS News‚Äôs Face the Nation.

On Monday, the City of El Paso, Texas, reported 461 new cases of the Wuhan virus, bringing the cumulative total to 86,172 cases:

To date, 47,397 residents have recovered from the virus and 37,267 cases remain active. For more information and other data visit https://t.co/ZQYzXomtTr ‚Äî City of El Paso (@ElPasoTXGov) November 30, 2020

On Sunday, the city‚Äôs mayor attributed the spike in cases to people experiencing ‚ÄúCOVID fatigue.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe hit, oh, about almost six weeks ago, we started spiking significantly. I think people just‚Äî the consensus is people just had COVID fatigue and they let down, as Dr. Birx said, you got to wear the mask and you‚Äôve got to maintain the distancing and you‚Äôve got to avoid the crowds,‚Äù he said, detailing the ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù officials conducted into their contact tracing for the week spanning November 10 through November 16.

The investigation found that ‚Äú55 percent of the positives were coming from shopping at large retailers, what we‚Äôd term as the big box stores,‚Äù according to the mayor:

And those are considered essential under CISA guidelines under homeland security. And we don‚Äôt really have- I don‚Äôt have any control over any limitations there. We‚Äôve asked for voluntary limitations and Wal-Mart and several others are starting to meter, meaning they‚Äôre going to limit the occupancy of their- of their stores, which we think- we also dug up the fact that previously our- over 52 percent of our positives were coming in the ages of 20 to 39. Now it‚Äôs 30 to 50. So we‚Äôre just trying to maintain, but recently, and I‚Äôm- I‚Äôm fearful to even mention it, we‚Äôve started to seem like we‚Äôre starting to maybe plateau. On Thanksgiving Day, we had 406 positives. The next day was 678.

CBS News‚Äôs Margaret Brennan asked Margo what other action he could take in light of the fact that big box retail stores, which officials say are contributing to the spread of the virus, are considered essential.

‚ÄúI know you just said that you can‚Äôt shut down big box stores because they‚Äôre deemed essential,‚Äù Brennan said.

‚ÄúBut at a certain point, because of what you‚Äôre talking about, if people aren‚Äôt taking personal responsibility for themselves and their own behavior, do you as mayor need to shut down what businesses you can?‚Äù she asked.

The mayor explained that he ‚Äútook action‚Äù to close down restaurant bars at 9 p.m., but Brennan noted that restaurants, as well as other stores, remain open.

‚ÄúWe were seeing a lot of congregating there. And so we shut them down at 9:00 p.m. for in-dining,‚Äù the mayor said.

‚ÄúThe state of Texas allowed bars to convert to restaurants with food trucks, kind of a ‚Äî some of them were kind of gaming the system, we think, and there was a lot of congregation there,‚Äù he continued, switching focus to private gatherings:

But, you know, when we look at the Rio Grande Valley and Hidalgo County, which went through a spike just before ours, we talked to their health department. What they discovered in their contact tracing was the majority of their positives were coming from- from home gatherings. And that‚Äôs- that‚Äôs also still problematic here. I mean, we‚Äôre- we‚Äôre a multigenerational community and family is big‚Äì and there‚Äôs travel to Mexico. There‚Äôs also those issues.

Similarly, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has also placed an emphasis on private gatherings, reporting that 65 percent of all cases are traced to gatherings of that nature.

‚ÄúThis is where the spread is coming from. It‚Äôs a small gathering spread. We have to communicate this now to people the way we communicated masks,‚Äù he said during Monday‚Äôs press conference.

‚ÄúSeemingly the safest place ‚Äî my home my table my family. Yeah, even that place is not safe,‚Äù he added.

El Paso made headlines earlier this month over the mobilization of the Texas National Guard, which was tasked with ‚Äúsupport[ing] the moratory affairs in the region‚Äù:

‚ÄúI hate to do this, but I NEED a PS5,‚Äù one user commented.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take orders from clueless adolescents,‚Äù another person said.

Despite Thunberg‚Äôs warnings, consumer spending has been strong since the economy began reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, writes Breitbart News‚Äôs John Carney:

Many consumers are feeling flush, their wealth boosted by a stock market that has pushed the S&P 500 up 65 percent since the lockdown low in March and soaring home values. Money not spent on trips, sports games, movies, or eating out has apparently gone into the purchase of consumer goods and contributed to savings accounts of many households.

‚ÄúBlack Friday was traditionally the day when many retailers first turned a profit for the year,‚Äù Carney noted.

However, those promoting Black Friday sales appeared not to draw the same size crowds this year as in previous years.

‚ÄúWhile the hustle and bustle of the holiday season has not completely disappeared, it is demonstratively lower this year due to fears, protocols, and limitations caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic,‚Äù Breitbart News reported.

Photos and video footage shared online showed small crowds and a few relatively empty parking lots:

‚ÄúThe intention of this is to be a joke, but it comes from a serious place, ‚ÄúAspell, 34, told Nottinghamshire Live. ‚ÄúWith the new restrictions we‚Äôre forced to close and it could be months before we can reopen.

‚ÄúEverything from gyms to massage parlours can stay open and even the Christmas markets are happening ‚Äì that was the point when I thought, this is ridiculous,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúSo, we have sent in an application to register as a place of worship.‚Äù

86,Cuomo Scolds New Yorkers for Private Gatherings: 'This Is Not Government Being Overly Dramatic',['Hannah Bleau'],"Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) scolded New Yorkers for gathering with friends and families in the comfort of their private homes, identifying such gatherings as contributing to the spread of the Chinese coronavirus and defending his order limiting gatherings to no more than ten people in private homes. He also floated volunteering to assist coronavirus patients in a hospital as an alternative to private Thanksgiving gatherings, though he failed to explain how that was safer.

‚ÄúThis is a dramatic shift,‚Äù Cuomo said during Monday‚Äôs press conference, referencing the spike in cases caused by small gatherings:

Hospitalizations are climbing ‚Äî statewide. What can you do? Cut out the small gatherings. Now. 65% of all cases are traced to small gatherings. Gov't can't enforce who's in your living room. But you can. ‚Äî Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) November 30, 2020

While he acknowledged that part of it is the nature of the holiday season, he also said people are gravitating toward small gatherings due to ‚Äúreduced social options.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt go to the bar and hang out. I can‚Äôt go to a restaurant and hang out. I can‚Äôt go to the movie theater and hang out. Come over to my house, and we‚Äôll hang out. It‚Äôs just an adaptation of social behavior to the circumstance,‚Äù Cuomo said.

‚ÄúWe have a rule in effect, no more than ten at an event,‚Äù Cuomo said, defending his mandate by pointing to other states that have similar rules in effect.

‚ÄúPeople say, ‚ÄòOh I can‚Äôt believe the New York rule, no more than ten.‚Äô Many states have a rule of no more than ten,‚Äù he said, adding that Kentucky is instituting a rule of no more than eight.

While Cuomo has publicly asked local governments to enforce his edicts, he admitted that the government does not have the ability to monitor the number of people an individual invites into his or her dwelling.

He continued:

This is a nationwide problem. I understand the people say I don‚Äôt like the restrictions. ‚ÄúI have COVID fatigue. How can you say I shouldn‚Äôt have more than ten people in my house?‚Äù Look. The truth is the government doesn‚Äôt have an ability to monitor it. But you want to know what is smart, what is reasonable, what is protective of other people and yourself? This is where the spread is coming from. It‚Äôs a small gathering spread. We have to communicate this now to people the way we communicated masks. Seemingly the safest place ‚Äî my home, my table, my family. Yeah, even that place is not safe.

Because of that, Cuomo‚Äôs administration will roll out a new public education campaign focusing on small, private gatherings.

‚ÄúThis is not government being overly dramatic. These are just facts,‚Äù Cuomo continued, arguing that his emphasis on limiting private gatherings is supported by ‚ÄúPresident Trump‚Äôs people and Joe Biden‚Äôs people.‚Äù He also cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, which advised Americans to gather with ‚Äúno more than your household‚Äù for Thanksgiving.

‚ÄúSo whose politics are you playing if Donald Trump says the CDC mandates it and Joe Biden‚Äôs advisers say it‚Äôs smart?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúWhose politics? Your own politics? You‚Äôre waving the political flag. Whose flag are you waving? It‚Äôs agreed to by both. It‚Äôs a fact of being smart, and luckily most of us are smart,‚Äù he continued.

The Democrat governor also used the opportunity to detail a conversation he had with a man over the weekend, who was purportedly incensed by Cuomo‚Äôs mandates, particularly his limit on gatherings in private homes.

‚ÄúNobody‚Äôs going to tell me how many people to have in my house. It‚Äôs my house. I want to have my family over I can have my family over,‚Äù Cuomo said, quoting the man.

‚ÄúI said alright. I‚Äôll make a deal with you right now. You do whatever you want in your house. Invite whoever you want. But here‚Äôs the deal. If somebody gets sick from what you did, you handle it,‚Äù Cuomo said, telling the man that he should not call an ambulance or go to the doctor and ‚Äúexpose‚Äù others because he ‚Äúwanted to be reckless‚Äù:

I said don‚Äôt call an ambulance and expose an ambulance driver. Don‚Äôt go to the hospital and expose a nurse and a doctor ‚Ä¶ because you wanted to be reckless. You handle it. Stay at home and take care of yourself. But don‚Äôt expose people, and don‚Äôt ask people to risk their lives because you undertook risky behavior. ‚ÄúOh no, no I won‚Äôt agree with that.‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúOh I see. You want to be able to behave in a risky way and then if you get sick, then other people have to risk their lives because you were risky.‚Äù Is that fair? But that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre asking.

‚ÄúYou want to be a tough guy ‚Ä¶ go volunteer in a field hospital in Staten Island and help COVID patients if you‚Äôre a tough guy,‚Äù Cuomo said, adding, ‚ÄúYou want to celebrate Thanksgiving? Bring your whole family and your extended family and go volunteer in a hospital and help COVID people.‚Äù

87,Kim Jong-un ‚ÄòHarshly Criticizes‚Äô North Korea‚Äôs Economic Agencies,['Ben Kew'],"‚ÄúIt stressed the need to put the operation and command for carrying out the Party‚Äôs economic policies on a scientific basis and display great dedication and responsibility,‚Äù reported the Korean Central News Agency (KNCA). ‚ÄúThe Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK discussed measures for important issues of carrying out immediate economic tasks for this year and adopted key decisions with unanimous approval.‚Äù

Kim‚Äôs raising of such concerns comes as the North Korean economy, which was already struggling under the weight of global economic sanctions, continues to suffer under the pressure of the Chinese coronavirus pandemic. Pyongyang‚Äôs own lockdowns have cut it off to much of the foreign capital it once relied on. Adding to these economic troubles has been the impact of consecutive summer typhoons believed to have devastated large swathes of the nation‚Äôs countryside.

His criticisms also follow unconfirmed reports last week that Kim has executed at least two officials in the past two months. Such reports, which cannot be independently verified, identified the two victims as a foreign exchange dealer accused of causing currency fluctuations and an official responsible for customs checks on the Chinese border.

In August, the 36-year-old dictator made a tearful admission that, despite incessant propaganda about his own unending wisdom and supernatural powers, North Korea‚Äôs economic progress has been ‚Äúseriously delayed‚Äù and the population continues to struggle as a result of ‚Äúunexpected and inevitable challenges in various aspects.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily. I am really sorry for that,‚Äù Kim declared before a military rally.

‚ÄúAlthough I am entrusted with the important responsibility to lead this country upholding the cause of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il thanks to the trust of all the people, my efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life,‚Äù he continued.

88,Democrat Jon Ossoff Signals Support for Lockdowns: ‚ÄòIt's Time to Trust the Experts‚Äô,['Ashley Oliver'],"Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said on CNN‚Äôs State of the Union on Sunday that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to address coronavirus spread if public health experts indicate a need for ‚Äústronger mitigation measures,‚Äù remarking that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to trust the experts.‚Äù

Ossoff, who is challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia‚Äôs race for U.S. Senate, told CNN host Dana Bash, ‚ÄúThe problem we‚Äôve had all year is that politicians have been suppressing and ignoring public health advice. It‚Äôs time to trust the experts, listen to public health professionals in a public health crisis.‚Äù

Bash said the White House Coronavirus Task Force has already indicated that ‚Äúthis is the moment to dramatically increase mitigation‚Äù due to a resurgence of the virus. Bash asked Ossoff, ‚ÄúSo would you support harsher restrictions in Georgia, like closing restaurants and businesses temporarily?‚Äù

The Georgia Democrat responded, ‚ÄúI think we should follow the expertise of public health experts like those of the CDC, which is based here in Georgia, and if that is the consensus of the public health community, we need to take that advice very seriously.‚Äù

Bash further pressed, ‚ÄúSo if they said, ‚ÄòShut things down temporarily,‚Äô you‚Äôd be all for it?‚Äù to which Ossoff replied, ‚ÄúIf the CDC and its leadership gave us strong indication that those kinds of stronger mitigation measures are necessary to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, it would be malpractice for politicians to ignore that advice.‚Äù

The Worldometer reports that Georgia currently has 162,886 active cases of the novel coronavirus, or 1.5 percent, of the state‚Äôs population of 10,617,423. At its peak, Georgia saw 6,209 new daily cases reported on November 21. Since then, new daily cases have substantially dropped, with the latest data showing 1,952 new daily cases reported on November 29.

Ossoff said the spread of the virus ‚Äúis out of control‚Äù and claimed people, including incumbent Perdue, have disregarded advice of public health experts. ‚ÄúThe problem is we‚Äôve ignored the public health experts, so I‚Äôll be listening to them and not to political consultants, pollsters, or folks looking out for their own financial interests, like my opponent.‚Äù

Perdue has advocated for a phased reopening of businesses and described the lockdown measures Ossoff supports as ‚Äúoverreaching‚Äù following Ossoff‚Äôs CNN interview:

If you think the overreaching lockdowns in states like New York and California are scary, know that Jon @Ossoff would support the very same policies ‚Äì for the entire country. pic.twitter.com/RADSX01uMO ‚Äî David Perdue (@Perduesenate) November 30, 2020

In the same interview, Bash also asked Ossoff about his recent endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, and whether Ossoff wants Sanders to campaign with him in the weeks leading up to the January 5 Senate runoff election. Ossoff said that while he has not had that conversation with Sanders, he welcomes Sanders‚Äô support.

Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler expressed concern after Ossoff‚Äôs television appearance that the Georgia Democrat‚Äôs support for lockdowns aligns with the socialist ideology‚Äôs tendency for government dependency.

‚ÄúOn January 5th, Georgians have a clear choice between socialism and freedom,‚Äù Sigler said. ‚ÄúJon Ossoff supports a national lockdown and seeks to keep the entire country shut inside until we are completely dependent on the federal government for everything. ‚Ä¶ We must reject Jon Ossoff and the radical Democrats‚Äô socialist agenda.‚Äù

89,Report: Over a Quarter of Small Businesses in New York and New Jersey Closed This Year,['Hannah Bleau'],"Over a quarter of small businesses in New York and New Jersey, areas hit hardest by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, have not reopened this year, according to a report from a Harvard-run database.

The database, TrackTheRecovery.org, revealed that 27.8 percent of small businesses in New York have not reopened following the mass shutdowns that occurred in the state this year, as of November 16. Even more businesses remained closed in New Jersey ‚Äî 31.2 percent.

The New York Post reported:

The figures are in line with estimates from the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, which says 28 percent of the Garden State‚Äôs small businesses had shut up shop by the end of October, according to the Star Ledger newspaper. ‚Ä¶ More than half of small businesses in both states were forced to shut their doors in the spring at the height of the pandemic, with both hitting highs in mid-April ‚Äî 52.5 percent of New York businesses and 53.9 percent in the Garden States, the stats show.

The news comes as virus rates begin to spike, prompting Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D) and Phil Murphy (D) to reintroduce restrictions in their respective states.

Murphy, who was recently confronted after dining out with his maskless family after retightening restrictions in the Garden State, told Fox News Sunday that a statewide lockdown remains ‚Äúon the table.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt has to stay on the table. Gov. Hutchinson, I think, had a similar answer to that. You hate like heck to even have to consider that, and God willing, we won‚Äôt have to,‚Äù he said, calling for a ‚Äúbig federal stimulus,‚Äù which he believes will act as a ‚Äúlifeline‚Äù for small businesses.

‚ÄúThat would be a game-changer. Not just in their lives and in their prospects, but it gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of dealing with the virus. So it‚Äôs on the table in terms of a shutdown,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt anticipate it, and I sure as heck don‚Äôt want to go that route but boy, federal stimulus would give us a lot more ammunition to do a lot more things right now,‚Äù Murphy added.

State and local governments across the country are also taking action as virus rates increase, preemptively closing businesses deemed nonessential and limiting capacity limitations at essential retailers, forming what has been dubbed ‚Äúmodern breadlines‚Äù in states such as New Mexico ahead of its recent two-week lockdown.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
90,49ers Blindsided by County Rules that Make them Homeless,[],"San Francisco coach Kyle Shanahan said the team was blindsided by new coronavirus regulations put in place by Santa Clara County officials that will force the 49ers to find a temporary new home for practice and games.

The county announced the new rules Saturday that include a three-week ban on practices and games for contact sports starting Monday. The Niners were on a plane getting ready to travel to Los Angeles where they beat the Rams 23-20 on Sunday when the players and coaches heard about the new rules that will force the team out of its homes.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been working with them as a partner, just trying to figure it out,‚Äù Shanahan said. ‚ÄúFor us to be heading out here yesterday and the relationship we have with them, for all of our players and coaches and everyone on that plane and our wives to find that out while we‚Äôre getting on a plane and no one to tell us. It was just extremely disappointing.‚Äù

A county spokeswoman didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment.

Along with banning contact sports, the new rules also require anyone who has traveled more than 150 miles from the county to quarantine for 14 days. The 49ers were set to return from the trip Sunday night just hours before the rules go into effect.

The 49ers will now need to find a new place to practice and to play games. They have two home games scheduled during this three-week stretch: Dec. 7 against Buffalo and Dec. 13 against Washington.

While there are options outside Santa Clara in the Bay Area, including the Raiders‚Äô old home at Oakland Coliseum, it appears more likely that the team will play its home games at an existing NFL stadium out of this market. The Arizona Cardinals and Dallas Cowboys have no home games scheduled on the same day as Niners home games the rest of the season.

‚ÄúThey made that decision and we‚Äôve got to deal with it,‚Äù Shanahan said. ‚ÄúBut to find that out through a tweet or a press conference where I have an entire plane coming up to me, I have all wives, everyone‚Äôs girlfriends, everyone‚Äôs family members, kids, saying that what they heard there. Are we going to be gone for the entire month of December? Are we going to be quarantined for 14 days when we get back? That‚Äôs all we could talk about for the last 18 hours because we got no answers from them. I was just very disappointed.‚Äù

The Niners have a few days to finalize their decision. With their next game not until a week from Monday, the team won‚Äôt start practicing until Thursday.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what the future holds,‚Äù quarterback Nick Mullens said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough for us but it‚Äôs more tough for the families. We‚Äôll see what happens. We‚Äôll adjust and we‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù

The rules also will impact the San Jose Sharks of the NHL and college teams at Stanford and San Jose State.

Stanford and San Jose State also have several sports in season. The Cardinal have one scheduled home football game left on Dec. 12 against Oregon State and will need to find a place to practice out of the county this week.

The Spartans have home football games on Dec. 5 against Hawaii and Dec. 11 against Nevada. San Jose State practiced before the season a few hundred miles away at Humboldt State because of restrictions in Santa Clara County.

San Jose State officials planned to meet with county officials on Sunday to get more details and then will formulate a plan.

‚ÄúWe are in a fluid situation with our football and basketball teams since their seasons are in progress,‚Äù athletic director Marie Tuite said. ‚ÄúWe will make decisions on team practices and when and where our contests are being played in conjunction with university administration and the Mountain West.‚Äù

Stanford‚Äôs second-ranked women‚Äôs basketball team will not play its scheduled home game Monday against San Diego. The team is looking for a place to practice.

The NHL hasn‚Äôt announced a date for the start of training camp but the Sharks have said they would look into alternate sites if needed. Several Sharks players have been holding informal workouts at the team facility in small groups.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
91,Ted Cruz Hammers Alyssa Milano On Coronavirus Aid: ‚ÄòEvery Senate Dem Voted to Block Relief‚Äô,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R, TX) called out leftist actress Alyssa Milano for her attack on Republican lawmakers blocking a recent coronavirus relief bill after she ignored months of Democrats blocking similar financial relief bills.

Alyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday to slap congressional Republicans for blocking a minimum wage hike and a coronavirus relief bill for working-class families. Milano posted her tweet as a reply to an earlier tweet by Sen. Cruz, in which he noted the statistics proving that the Democrats are now the party of the super-rich, coastal elites while the GOP has become the party of working class Americans.

This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it‚Äôs the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down. ‚Äî Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 29, 2020

The Charmed star questioned Cruz‚Äô contention that the GOP is now the party of the working classes by noting that the GOP had blocked the coronavirus bill. ‚ÄúThis is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it‚Äôs the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down,‚Äù Milnao tweeted on Sunday.

It is not exactly clear what bills Milano was speaking about but it is possible she was referring to the latest $15 Minimum Wage increase that died in the Senate. And she could be referring to Senate leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs decision back in October to ignore Democrat Chuck Schumer‚Äôs attempt to force the upper chamber to discuss a second $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

Schumer wanted to debate his relief bill when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was being confirmed. It would have restored the $600-per-week federal unemployment boost and would have sent another $1,200 stimulus check to Americans.

But Senator Cruz quickly pushed back. The Texas Senator noted that Milano conveniently ignored the many months that Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate blocked the GOP‚Äôs $500 billion coronavirus aid bill.

‚ÄúAlyssa, facts matter,‚Äù Cruz tweeted back to Milano. ‚ÄúDems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief.

Protesters gathered in front of a dark, grey house with a sign on the door warning trespassers to keep out, the Salem Statesman Journal reported.

The house is owned by a safety and health enforcement manager who worked for the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Organizers of the rally accused the manager of being the inspector who deemed Courthouse Club and Fitness to be unsafe.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in that house, we‚Äôre asking you to stand with the people ‚Ä¶ because if you don‚Äôt stand with us, we‚Äôre going to go through some real difficult times,‚Äù protest organizer Joey Gibson said.

Brown‚Äôs order made it a requirement for gyms and fitness centers, as well as other businesses, to close between November 18 and December 2 to respond to and stop the rising level of coronavirus cases.

Courthouse Club Fitness stated in a now-deleted post on its Facebook page that it would remain open and received a $90,000 fine just more than a week later.

State health officials said the fine was calculated from the citations of each of the four fitness clubs‚Äô facilities.

‚ÄúThe total penalty for each individual inspection is $22,500,‚Äù said Mark Peterson, acting spokesman for OSHA. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a willful penalty of $17,500 for being open to the public and a separate $5,000 penalty for violating the Red Warning Notices that we posted at each location late last week.‚Äù

94,Stacey Abrams Voter Registration Group Denies Impropriety,['Kyle Morris'],"Brad Raffensperger, Georgia‚Äôs Republican Secretary of State, resurrected a tired and false claim against the New Georgia Project‚Äôs legitimate efforts to register eligible Georgians to participate in elections in a press conference held Monday morning, November 30th.

Nse Ufot, Executive Director of the New Georgia Project said:

As Georgians are turning out in record numbers to have their voices heard at the polls, the Secretary of State is resorting to desperate attempts to smear law-abiding organizations and scare eligible Georgians from registering to vote in critical upcoming elections. We will not be deterred. This attack on our organization comes at a time when people across the country have witnessed the strength of our program and the collective power of a new Georgia electorate that embraces a system of inclusivity and opportunity for all Georgians. The timing is not accidental.

The organization also stated that it will ‚Äúcontinue its mission to register eligible voters in advance of the December 7th deadline‚Äù in its efforts to make sure that Georgia residents ‚Äúhave their voices heard at the polls and freely and fairly cast their ballots for those who would represent them.‚Äù

Raffensperger announced earlier Monday that his office will launch an investigation into voting groups accused of encouraging non-Georgia residents to register to vote in the runoff elections, which are set to take place on January 5.

‚ÄúWe have opened an investigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absentee ballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994,‚Äù Raffensperger said during a press conference, adding:

Voting in Georgia when you are not a resident of Georgia is a felony, and encouraging college kids to commit felonies with no regard for what [it] might mean for them is despicable. These third-party groups have a responsibility to not encourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.

Other organizations set to face scrutiny from the investigation include America Votes, Operation New Voter Registration Georgia, and Vote Forward.

Last week, Abrams announced that 900,000 Georgians had requested a mail-in ballot for the runoff elections between Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and her Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock, and another between Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and his Democrat opponent Jon Ossoff.

Interestingly, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Warnock served as the CEO of The New Georgia Project until February of this year.

‚ÄúWarnock was listed as CEO of the New Georgia Project from 2017 until Feb. 21, 2020, according to the group‚Äôs corporate filings,‚Äù the report stated. ‚ÄúHe has been identified as the New Georgia Project‚Äôs chairman and spokesman in media reports and has said he organized voter mobilization drives for the group, including a push to register 80,000 new minority voters in 2014.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The attorney added that the order was later ‚Äúreversed‚Äù when a judge deemed Georgia counties to be in control of the voting machines.

‚ÄúTime to obey the law. Stop the destruction of evidence,‚Äù tweeted Wood at several Georgia officials on Sunday, sharing an image of the federal court order.

‚ÄúPlaintiffs contend that union county officials have advised that they are going to wipe or reset the voting machines of all data and bring the count back to zero on Monday, November 30,‚Äù the court order stated. It went on:

To the extent Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order to preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data, their motion is granted. Defendants are ordered to maintain the status quo and are temporarily enjoined from wiping or resetting any voting machines in the State of Georgia until further order of the Court.

The order was signed by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten on Sunday.

‚ÄúOur Republican recount monitors at the World Congress Center waited today for four hours while Fulton County elections officials ‚Äòupdated the software,'‚Äù tweeted the Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, David Shafer.

Wood is the Georgia-based attorney most famous for successfully suing the media on behalf of Richard Jewell in the 90s, as well as on behalf of Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann last year.

‚ÄúIt is outrageous that we cannot rely on Fulton County elections officials to do their jobs without unexplained four hour delays, interventions by private attorneys and federal court orders,‚Äù Shafer added.

The court order, however, was apparently rescinded, as Wood later announced in a follow-up tweet that a judge had reversed the federal order based on the Defendants‚Äô claim that Georgia counties control voting machines.

‚ÄúWhat??? Judge reversed order based on Defendants‚Äô claim that GA Counties control voting machines,‚Äù wrote Wood. ‚ÄúMachines are owned by State & [Georgia Secretary of State] administers state laws on elections.‚Äù

98,"Exclusive ‚Äî Blackburn: ‚ÄòVital‚Äô that Georgians Reelect Loeffler, Perdue to Protect Senate ‚ÄòFirewall‚Äô Against Left",['Matthew Boyle'],"Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart News exclusively that the upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5 represent a ‚Äúclassic battle between freedom and socialism.‚Äù

Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) will face off against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock respectively for both of Georgia‚Äôs U.S. Senate seats and potentially control of the majority in the U.S. Senate at stake. Republicans will definitely have at least 50 seats in the Senate next year, and Democrats will definitely have at least 48. If the Democrats were to take both of these seats, then the Senate would be tied at 50-50 and whoever the vice president of the United States is next year would cut the tie and determine the majority control in the Senate.

Since Democrat presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads in enough states to win the electoral college, that would probably be now-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)‚Äîhis running mate‚Äîshould challenges from President Donald Trump fail. If Trump were to succeed in his election challenges, then Vice President Mike Pence would cut ties in the Senate. But as it stands now, barring a miraculous legal challenge comeback by Trump, in a 50-50 Senate it would be Harris cutting ties and steering control of the upper chamber of Congress to the Democrat Party.

Blackburn argued in an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel that the Democrats would use victories in these Georgia Senate races if they got them to implement a radical leftist and socialist agenda.

‚ÄúWhat you have is a classic battle between freedom and socialism,‚Äù Blackburn said. ‚ÄúChuck Schumer has said, in his glee on Election Day, he said first we go ‚Äòtake‚Äô Georgia‚Äînot we go earn the vote, not we work in Georgia to win, but ‚Äòtake.‚Äô They are planning, the left is planning to ‚Äòtake‚Äô Georgia. Then Schumer said they will ‚Äòchange‚Äô America. The ‚Äòchange‚Äô they are planning for America is adding justices to the Supreme Court, changing the Supreme Court, giving statehood to D.C. Now, D.C. is not as big as Atlanta, but D.C. is going to be a state if the Democrats get their way. Statehood for Puerto Rico, and making sure they take health insurance away from 153 million Americans and 57 million Medicare enrollees and putting everyone into a Medicaid-style program that is run by the government. They want to implement the Green New Deal, and they want to give felons the right to vote‚Äîand that is the plan just for their first 100 days. This is what they are going to do if they are given the opportunity. Bear in mind what they plan to do is use Georgia and then force their will not only on Georgians but also on the American people.‚Äù

Blackburn urged all Republicans and Trump supporters to get out and vote for Perdue and Loeffler, saying it is ‚Äúvital‚Äù for them to do so since the ‚Äúleft is organized‚Äù in a systemic way to try to manufacture wins for Ossoff and Perdue.

‚ÄúIt is absolutely vital,‚Äù Blackburn said when asked how critical it is for Trump supporters to back Loeffler and Perdue. ‚ÄúThe left is organized because they cannot get by with implementing all the stuff they‚Äôre wanting to foist upon Americans unless they win Georgia. The Senate has been the firewall. They‚Äôre the ones that have blocked a lot of stuff. It is so important that we make certain that we carry these races in Georgia. I guarantee you I am going to be out there working every single day‚Äînight and day‚Äîto make certain that we win these races. You just think about the people who would be heading these various committees. Do you really want Bernie Sanders chairing the Senate Budget Committee? Do you really want somebody like Elizabeth Warren leading the Senate Armed Services Committee? Do you really want someone like Dick Durbin as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Most Georgians would say no I‚Äôm not comfortable with that because these are individuals who are too far left for me. So the only thing that stands between that happening and not is for the people of Georgia to go elect Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.‚Äù

Pence is headed back to Georgia on Friday, and Trump is heading there on Saturday, to campaign with Loeffler and Perdue. Several other top GOP stars have already been to the state and more are planning trips there over the next month.

99,Kemp Rejects Call to Strengthen GA Recount with Emergency Powers,['Joshua Caplan'],"‚ÄúGeorgia law prohibits the governor from interfering in elections. The Secretary of State, who is an elected constitutional officer, has oversight over elections that cannot be overridden by executive order,‚Äù Cody Hall, a spokesperson for Kemp, said in a statement to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ‚ÄúAs the governor has said repeatedly, he will continue to follow the law and encourage the Secretary of State to take reasonable steps ‚Äì including a sample audit of signatures ‚Äì to restore trust and address serious issues that have been raised.‚Äù

Earlier Monday, President Trump criticized Kemp for failing to tackle the ‚Äúgoldmine of fraud‚Äù in the state‚Äôs presidential election by not signature matching mail-in ballots.‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt Governor Brian Kemp, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,‚Äù the president tweeted in reference to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).

‚Ä¶.Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots. You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do. Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 30, 2020

‚ÄúGeorgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!‚Äù he added.

Raffensperger has said signatures matching is now impossible due to ballots being separated from their outer envelopes.

President Trump also suggested that the state‚Äôs election could have been plagued by other types of irregularities.

‚ÄúAlso, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,‚Äù he tweeted. ‚ÄúYou may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do.‚Äù

Shortly after President Trump‚Äôs comments, his campaign announced that it sent a fifth request to Raffensperger for a signature audit.

‚ÄúIt is not possible for you to accurately certify the results in the presidential race from the November 3, 2020, election until and unless there is a thorough audit of the signatures, which we have now requested four times in writing prior to this request. You cannot in good faith conclude the ongoing statutory recount until you have instituted a signature matching audit,‚Äù said Trump campaign lawyer Ray Smith.

‚ÄúUntil the signatures are matched, the vote count in Georgia is a complete fraud,‚Äù added former New York City Mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. ‚ÄúThere is no way of knowing which ballots are honest and which ballots are fraudulent.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
100,Democrat Jon Ossoff Signals Support for Lockdowns: ‚ÄòIt's Time to Trust the Experts‚Äô,['Ashley Oliver'],"Georgia Democrat Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said on CNN‚Äôs State of the Union on Sunday that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to address coronavirus spread if public health experts indicate a need for ‚Äústronger mitigation measures,‚Äù remarking that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to trust the experts.‚Äù

Ossoff, who is challenging Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia‚Äôs race for U.S. Senate, told CNN host Dana Bash, ‚ÄúThe problem we‚Äôve had all year is that politicians have been suppressing and ignoring public health advice. It‚Äôs time to trust the experts, listen to public health professionals in a public health crisis.‚Äù

Bash said the White House Coronavirus Task Force has already indicated that ‚Äúthis is the moment to dramatically increase mitigation‚Äù due to a resurgence of the virus. Bash asked Ossoff, ‚ÄúSo would you support harsher restrictions in Georgia, like closing restaurants and businesses temporarily?‚Äù

The Georgia Democrat responded, ‚ÄúI think we should follow the expertise of public health experts like those of the CDC, which is based here in Georgia, and if that is the consensus of the public health community, we need to take that advice very seriously.‚Äù

Bash further pressed, ‚ÄúSo if they said, ‚ÄòShut things down temporarily,‚Äô you‚Äôd be all for it?‚Äù to which Ossoff replied, ‚ÄúIf the CDC and its leadership gave us strong indication that those kinds of stronger mitigation measures are necessary to save lives and contain the spread of the virus, it would be malpractice for politicians to ignore that advice.‚Äù

The Worldometer reports that Georgia currently has 162,886 active cases of the novel coronavirus, or 1.5 percent, of the state‚Äôs population of 10,617,423. At its peak, Georgia saw 6,209 new daily cases reported on November 21. Since then, new daily cases have substantially dropped, with the latest data showing 1,952 new daily cases reported on November 29.

Ossoff said the spread of the virus ‚Äúis out of control‚Äù and claimed people, including incumbent Perdue, have disregarded advice of public health experts. ‚ÄúThe problem is we‚Äôve ignored the public health experts, so I‚Äôll be listening to them and not to political consultants, pollsters, or folks looking out for their own financial interests, like my opponent.‚Äù

Perdue has advocated for a phased reopening of businesses and described the lockdown measures Ossoff supports as ‚Äúoverreaching‚Äù following Ossoff‚Äôs CNN interview:

If you think the overreaching lockdowns in states like New York and California are scary, know that Jon @Ossoff would support the very same policies ‚Äì for the entire country. pic.twitter.com/RADSX01uMO ‚Äî David Perdue (@Perduesenate) November 30, 2020

In the same interview, Bash also asked Ossoff about his recent endorsement from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, and whether Ossoff wants Sanders to campaign with him in the weeks leading up to the January 5 Senate runoff election. Ossoff said that while he has not had that conversation with Sanders, he welcomes Sanders‚Äô support.

Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler expressed concern after Ossoff‚Äôs television appearance that the Georgia Democrat‚Äôs support for lockdowns aligns with the socialist ideology‚Äôs tendency for government dependency.

‚ÄúOn January 5th, Georgians have a clear choice between socialism and freedom,‚Äù Sigler said. ‚ÄúJon Ossoff supports a national lockdown and seeks to keep the entire country shut inside until we are completely dependent on the federal government for everything. ‚Ä¶ We must reject Jon Ossoff and the radical Democrats‚Äô socialist agenda.‚Äù

101,Georgia‚Äôs Fulton County Recount Delayed After Dominion Server Crash,['Hannah Bleau'],"The recount requested by President Trump‚Äôs campaign in Georgia‚Äôs Fulton County experienced a delay after a Dominion Voting Systems mobile server crashed on Sunday, according to Fulton County officials.

‚ÄúTechnicians from Dominion have been dispatched to resolve the issue,‚Äù Fulton County officials said in a statement after the server crashed on Sunday. ‚ÄúThe Georgia Secretary of State‚Äôs office has also been alerted to the issue and is aware of efforts to resolve the problem.‚Äù

Dominion has remained at the center of claims of error and fraud in the 2020 election. While Sidney Powell is not formally part of President Trump‚Äôs legal team, she participated in a joint press conference with his campaign prior to Thanksgiving and detailed the purported issues with the voting machines.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Powell argued that U.S. votes were being counted overseas, and that Dominion voting machines and Smartmatic software were controlled by foreign interests, manipulating algorithms to change the results. Powell noted specifically that Smartmatic‚Äôs owners included two Venezuelan nationals, whom she alleged had ties to the regime of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. The legal team alleged that there were statistical anomalies, such as huge batches of votes for Biden, that could not be explained except as manipulation ‚Äî which, they alleged, happened in the wee hours of the morning as vote-counting had stalled. (The companies have disputed these allegations vigorously.)

Powell filed lawsuits challenging the election results in Georgia and Michigan last week, which contained the allegations she previewed at the press conference.

‚ÄúMathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia,‚Äù Powell alleged, adding that ‚Äúespecially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County.‚Äù

Researchers have also questioned the reliability of the voting systems, noting that they ‚Äúregister votes in bar codes that the human eye cannot decipher‚Äù which could give voters ‚Äúprintouts that accurately spell out the names of the candidates they picked, but, because of a hack, the bar codes do not reflect those choices.‚Äù

In October, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) warned that Georgia‚Äôs newly implemented Dominion voting system was vulnerable to cyberattacks. It also noted that Texas rejected the Dominion equipment due to ‚Äúmultiple hardware issues.‚Äù

Top Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (MA), Amy Klobuchar (MN), and Ron Wyden (OR) also signaled concern over Dominion‚Äôs technology in 2019. In a letter to the private equity firms controlling the top U.S. election technology companies, the senators expressed concern over ‚Äúvulnerabilities and a lack of transparency in the election technology industry and the poor condition of voting machines and other election technology equipment.‚Äù

However, Dominion has fervently denied what it called ‚Äúfalse assertions about vote switching and software issues‚Äù with their voting systems, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) has dismissed Powell‚Äôs accusations.

102,Trump Urges Georgia Governor to Strengthen Recount,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump on Monday warned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) of a ‚Äúgoldmine of fraud‚Äù without signature matching for mail-in ballots in the state recount.

‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt Governor Brian Kemp, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,‚Äù Trump asked, referring to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).

Trump channeled anger from Georgia state Republicans about the election results and the subsequent hand recounts that did not revisit the signature verification.

‚ÄúGeorgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!‚Äù he wrote.

Raffensperger has claimed that matching the signatures is no longer possible because the ballots have been separated from the outer envelope.

But Trump argued that verifying the signatures in the recount would eliminate any potential fraud ‚Äî both in the 2020 election and the Georgia Senate runoff election.

‚ÄúIt will be a ‚Äògoldmine‚Äô of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state,‚Äù Trump wrote.

The president also questioned whether the number of envelopes matched up with the number of ballots cast in the Georgia 2020 election, suggesting there were other signs of fraud.

‚ÄúAlso, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúYou may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
103,Newt Gingrich: America's Future Depends on Georgia's Senate Races,['Robert Kraychik'],"America‚Äôs future depends on the outcomes of the elections for the U.S. Senate in Georgia, said former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich (R-GA) on Monday, offering his remarks on SiriusXM‚Äôs Breitbart News Daily with host Alex Marlow.

Marlow asked about demoralization among conservatives and Republicans in Georgia rooted in mistrust of the electoral and political systems.

‚ÄúA lot of people in the audience are discouraged,‚Äù Marlow stated. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the majority, by any means, but there‚Äôs certainly a number of people who‚Äôve been pretty vocal that they‚Äôre discouraged. They think the election process ‚Äî if it‚Äôs not going to be legitimate ‚Äî then there‚Äôs no point in voting and they don‚Äôt want to vote. They‚Äôre going protest in Georgia by not voting. I would like to hope it‚Äôs a small number of people, but a small number of people could swing the whole election. Do you have a message for those people?‚Äù

Gingrich urged Georgians to vote and volunteer as poll watchers.

LISTEN:

Gingrich continued with this advice, ‚ÄúMy message is very simple. The future of the United States depends on the outcome of the Georgia Senate races. If you don‚Äôt want a radical left-wing America dominated by left-wing judges with massive tax increases, with a policy, frankly, of appeasing China, and you don‚Äôt want that kind of future, you have to go out and vote. And then frankly, you have to volunteer as a poll watcher and make sure they don‚Äôt steal the election. But I think these things are vital and I don‚Äôt think we should in any way underestimate how really important the Georgia Senate race.‚Äù

The 2020 election ‚Äúmay be the biggest Presidential theft since Adams and Clay robbed Andrew Jackson in 1824,‚Äù wrote Gingrich on Friday via Twitter.

The more data comes out on vote anomalies that clearly are not legitimate the more it looks like 2020 may be the biggest Presidential theft since Adams and Clay robbed Andrew Jackson in 1824. State legislatures should demand recounts ‚Äî Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) November 27, 2020

Gingrich contrasted 1824‚Äôs presidential election with 2020‚Äôs.

‚ÄúIn 1824, Andrew Jackson had At 40 percent of the popular vote, but the guys who came in number two and three combined in the House of Representatives of John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay decided that even though Jackson got the most votes, he wouldn‚Äôt be president,‚Äù Gingrich explained. ‚ÄúSo Jackson spent the next four years attacking them for representing a corrupt establishment and decisively beat Adams in 1828, and really the caused a dramatic uprising against the old order because people were just sick of it.‚Äù

Everything hinges on Georgia's January 5th Senate runoff. https://t.co/obPHqU9nmk ‚Äî Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 26, 2020

Gingrich warned Democrats focus on election mechanics while Republicans focus on political campaigning. He highlighted get-out-the-vote efforts funded by Mark Zuckerberg and other left-wing billionaires and Democrat-driven election law changes as examples of Democrats‚Äô focus on electioneering.

‚ÄúYou have to think of two parallel projects,‚Äù determined Gingrich. ‚ÄúThere is the campaign, which is what the Republicans focus on, and there is the election, which is what the Democrats focus on. If we don‚Äôt find a way to have an honest election, the campaign won‚Äôt matter, because we will be drowned in ballots that are illegally gathered [through] harvested ballots.‚Äù

‚ÄúTrucks flying Trump and ‚ÄòStop the Steal‚Äô flags drove up and down the street outside of Secretary Brad Raffensperger‚Äôs property, honking their horns as they passed by,‚Äù Fox 5 reported.

Organizer Ursula Christie told the outlet she wanted Raffensperger to know ‚Äúwe are silent no more and we want him to know that we are watching and we are listening and we are aware of the actions being taken.‚Äù

Raffensperger, a Republican, said he voted for Trump but has received criticism for his handling of the election.

‚ÄúOn Thanksgiving Day, Trump called Georgia‚Äôs election was [sic] part of a ‚Äòfraudulent system‚Äô and said Raffensperger was an ‚Äòenemy of the people,'‚Äù the Fox 5 report continued.

During an interview with CNN‚Äôs Jake Tapper on November 18, Raffensperger dismissed allegations of voter fraud in his state but acknowledged the possibility of clerical errors:

We have not seen any widespread voter fraud. The president has picked up some votes in a few of the counties that made some clerical errors. It wasn‚Äôt the machines. But at the end of the day, he started with 14,000. He‚Äôs about 12,000 now. But we‚Äôre finishing up, waiting for a few more counties to get back to us, large counties, but I don‚Äôt believe at the end of the day it will change the total results.

When asked if he believed former Vice President Joe Biden would win Georgia, Raffensperger said ‚ÄúYes, I believe that‚Äôs the way it will turn out.‚Äù

However, in a Friday tweet, Trump said ‚ÄúBiden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous ‚Äò80,000,000 votes‚Äô were not fraudulently or illegally obtained.‚Äù

The president reacted to a Newsmax article about Trump supporters in Georgia considering a boycott of the election.

‚ÄúNo, the 2020 Election was a total scam, we won by a lot (and will hopefully turn over the fraudulent result), but we must get out and help David and Kelly, two GREAT people,‚Äù Trump wrote on Twitter.

Many Trump supporters are enraged by their state GOP representatives in Georgia, accusing them of failing to back the president in a contentious recount in which former Vice President Joe Biden still holds a roughly 12,000 vote lead.

But Trump said that a boycott would only help Democrats.

‚ÄúOtherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people,‚Äù he wrote.

As Breitbart News reported, Democrats are already exploiting tensions in the state by spreading the message that Republicans should not back the Georgia Republican candidates because of their failure to fight for the president.

Trump‚Äôs son Donald Trump Jr. has also opposed any boycotts.

‚ÄúThat is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people,‚Äù he wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúWe need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.‚Äù

Trump again promised to hold a campaign rally for Loeffler and Perdue as Republicans work to maintain control of their Senate majority.

‚ÄúI will be in Georgia on Saturday!‚Äù he wrote, referring to his planned rally for December 5.

The president is watching the race closely as Democrats work to flip the state and seize control of the Senate.

Trump described Perdue‚Äôs Democrat opponent, Jon Ossoff, as a ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù in a conversation with reporters on Thursday and Loeffler‚Äôs opponent, Raphael Warnock, as ‚Äúeither a communist or a socialist. I cannot figure that out yet.‚Äù

With the Senate majority leadership within his reach, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, ‚ÄúNow we take Georgia, and then we change America.‚Äù Now Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are reportedly the latest Hollywood celebrities to lend their star power to Democrats in Georgia, hoping to boost the chances of candidates Raphael Warrnock and Jon Ossoff and turn the Senate blue.

The acting power couple will join comedian Billy Eichner and Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. in a fundraiser for Swing Left, one of many progressive organizations that is mobilizing Democratic turnout in Georgia, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Maze Runner producer Ellen Goldsmith-Vein will co-host the December 3 event.

Swing Left is among the many progressive groups that have set their sights on Georgia ahead of the state‚Äôs January 5 runoffs. The organization, which was founded in the wake of President Trump‚Äôs 2016 victory, has specialized in recruiting celebrities to push its agenda, including Broadway and Homeland star Mandy Patinkin.

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick teamed up with Swing Left in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, participating in podcasts and donating money to the group.

Hollywood celebrities have made Georgia their top political priority in their effort to push Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock across the finish line. A-list stars including George Clooney and Will Smith have poured money into the races, while actors Kumail Nanjiani and Sophia Bush are spearheading WinBothSeats, an initiative to get out the minority vote for Democrats.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is holding a Veep reunion next month to raise money for America Votes, the left-wing group that is working to boost Democratic chances in Georgia‚Äôs runoffs. Other stars pushing Georgia Democrats on social media include Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing.

The White House clarified after Trump‚Äôs remarks that he would campaign in the state on Saturday, December 5.

Both Republican Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler face a runoff election on January 5, as Republicans try to hold on to their Senate majority.

‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll go twice. That‚Äôs very important that we win those races. These are great people,‚Äù Trump said.

Trump said that he warned Perdue and Loeffler of the voting system in the state of Georgia.

‚ÄúListen, you have a fraudulent system. You have to be very careful,‚Äù he recalled telling them.

Trump said that because of the coronavirus pandemic, he would probably host an outdoor rally in Georgia, most likely at an airport.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre looking for the right site,‚Äù he said.

Trump disputed a reporter‚Äôs assertion that this was his last Thanksgiving in the White House.

‚ÄúWell we don‚Äôt know what is last ‚Äî if you look at what‚Äôs going on. ‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre finding tremendous discrepancies in the votes, and nobody believes those numbers. Those numbers are incorrect numbers.‚Äù

He predicted that more evidence of voter fraud would come out in a number of weeks.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens. Nobody wants to see the kind of fraud that this election has really come to represent,‚Äù he said.

Trump said he would continue fighting the election results, noting that former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Kamala Harris opposed his policy of ‚ÄúAmerica First.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have somebody assume office and already they want to get rid of ‚ÄòAmerica First.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ You know why?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúBecause China doesn‚Äôt want it.‚Äù

One reporter asked Trump if he would concede the presidential election if the electoral college voted for Biden on December 14.

Starting on Friday, Abrams will brief Hollywood agents, managers, publicists, and entertainment executives on how they can help elect Georgia U.S. Senate Democrat candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock ahead of the runoff elections in according to the Hollywood Reporter.

On January 5, Georgia will have its runoff elections between senator Kelly Loeffler (R) and candidate Raphael Warnockas (D), as well as senator David Perdue (R) and candidate Jon Ossoff (D).

Abrams‚Äô organization Fair Fight is enlisting celebrities like Selena Gomez, Yara Shahidi, Issa Rae, Keke Palmer and Steph Curry for voting videos, as well as dumping millions of dollars to assist over a dozen organizations in their efforts ahead of the runoffs.

‚ÄúI believe very much in the power of celebrity to cut through the noise of politics,‚Äù Abrams said last week.

Celebrities also now believe that they have a vested interest in the turning the state blue, as tax incentives have brought Hollywood productions from California to Georgia in recent years, bringing the celebrities and other staff to the traditionally red state.

‚ÄúBeing someone who worked in Georgia for two years while I shot [Netflix series] Insatiable, I‚Äôm really aware of how powerful and impactful the organizers are,‚Äù said actress and political activist Alyssa Milano.

New Georgia Project executive director Nse Ufot echoed those sentiments.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been talking for quite a bit of time about how we are trying to change the culture of voting ‚Äî what better way to do that than by partnering with culture workers, people who are literally responsible for helping us shift the narrative and tell better stories about ourselves,‚Äù said Ufot. ‚ÄúOur state is growing by leaps and bounds because of an influx of storytellers and people who support them. I think that that could be a secret weapon as we think about the new Georgia.‚Äù

LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Marxist political organization Black Voters Matter, echoed those sentiments as well, and claimed, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not the headquarters for Southern white male racists‚Äù now that Hollywood has imposed itself.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen this transition ‚Äî Georgia is the number one place for film productions, so this city has become more internationalized, I think one,‚Äù said Brown. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs been attractive to bringing diverse folks to the state.‚Äù

110,"Sidney Powell Files Lawsuits Challenging Election Results in Georgia, Michigan",['Joel B. Pollak'],"Attorney Sidney Powell filed lawsuits Wednesday challenging the results of the presidential vote in Georgia and Michigan, alleging ‚Äúballot stuffing,‚Äù which she alleges was ‚Äúamplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software created and run by domestic and foreign actors.‚Äù

Powell made similar claims last week at a press conference with President Donald Trump‚Äôs legal team. She was attacked by critics who claimed that she could not prove what she alleged. The legal team distanced themselves from her on Sunday, saying that her claims had gone beyond the evidence they had seen or could prove in court.

Powell ‚Äî who also defended Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, pardoned by President Trump on Wednesday ‚Äî accepted the decision but pressed ahead regardless.

She alleges in Georgia:

Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia. Especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County. This scheme and artifice to defraud affected tens of thousands of votes in Georgia alone and ‚Äúrigged‚Äù the election in Georgia for Joe Biden.

Powell makes similar allegations in Michigan, noting an ‚Äúespecially egregious range of conduct in Wayne County and the City of Detroit, though this conduct occurred throughout the State at the direction of Michigan state election officials.‚Äù

Powell traces the fraud to ‚Äúsoftware and hardware from Dominion Voting Systems Corporation,‚Äù which she said derives from software created by ‚ÄúSmartmatic Corporation, which became Sequoia in the United States.‚Äù

She goes on to allege, in both the Georgia and the Michigan complaints, ‚ÄúSmartmatic and Dominion were founded by foreign oligarchs and dictators to ensure computerized ballot-stuffing and vote manipulation to whatever level was needed to make certain Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez never lost another election.‚Äù

Based on the affidavit of a whistleblower, Powell alleges that the systems were designed to make ballot-stuffing hard to detect by a ‚Äúsimple audit.‚Äù They were manipulated, she says, by people who had access to the systems.

In Georgia, she says:

[V]ideo from the State Farm Arena in Fulton County shows that on November 3rd after the polls closed, election workers falsely claimed a water leak required the facility to close. All poll workers and challengers were evacuated for several hours at about 10:00 PM. However, several election workers remained unsupervised and unchallenged working at the computers for the voting tabulation machines until after 1:00 AM.

She also claimed that ‚Äúthe Dominion software was accessed by agents acting on behalf of China and Iran in order to monitor and manipulate elections, including the most recent US general election in 2020.‚Äù One expert, she says, ‚Äúconcludes that hundreds of thousands of votes that were cast for President Trump in the 2020 general election were transferred to former Vice-President Biden.‚Äù

And she adds that ‚ÄúGeorgia‚Äôs election officials and poll workers exacerbated and helped, whether knowingly or unknowingly, the Dominion system carry out massive voter manipulation by refusing to observe statutory safeguards for absentee ballots. Election officials failed to verify signatures and check security envelopes. They barred challengers from observing the count, which also facilitated the fraud.‚Äù

In Michigan, Powell says, in addition to problems with Dominion, there were ‚Äúadditional categories of ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô voting fraud and Michigan Election Code violations, supplemented by healthy doses of harassment, intimidation, discrimination, abuse and even physical removal of Republican poll challengers to eliminate any semblance of transparency, objectivity or fairness from the vote counting process.‚Äù

Powell alleges, citing expert testimony, that Michigan saw tens of thousands of ‚Äúexcess voters,‚Äù where unassigned or blank absentee ballots were filled out by election workers, and nearly all of those votes went to Joe Biden. She also alleges that in four precincts, more ballots were counted than could be physically processed during a two and-a-half hour interval Nov. 4.

She alleges that glitches in Michigan ‚Äî such as one that mistakenly counted 6,000 votes for Biden in Antrim County ‚Äî were always in Biden‚Äôs favor.

There are enough ballots affected, Powell argues, for the courts to set aside the results of the 2020 election in each state.

Attorney L. Lin Wood is also among those listed in the filings.

Scott said, ‚Äú[T]here is only one giant in the party, and that is President Donald Trump. Donald Trump comes to our great state of Georgia, and here‚Äôs what happens, President Trump has a chance to talk about his enormous support for historically black colleges and universities. One of the reasons why President Trump‚Äôs African American numbers went up‚Ä¶this election cycle is because he brought the highest level of funding to HBCUs, made the funding permanent. He passed criminal justice reform, making up for the disaster of the 1994 crime bill brought to you by Joe Biden. He‚Äôs the one who made sure that we focus on sickle cell anemia research. But for every single Georgian, he brought tax reform. He reset the regulatory state so that we created more jobs, not lost more jobs.

112,Democrat Jon Ossoff Claims ‚ÄòOversight‚Äô in Omitting Payment from Chinese Communist-Linked Company,['Kristina Wong'],"Georgia Senate Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff‚Äôs campaign is claiming its omission from its financial disclosures in May of a payment from a Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-linked company to Ossoff‚Äôs media production company was due to a ‚Äúpaperwork oversight.‚Äù

After a political ad asserted that Ossoff ignored rules and hid cash from Chinese communists, an Ossoff campaign spokesperson called it a ‚Äúpaperwork oversight.‚Äù

The November 17 Senate Leadership Fund ad said, ‚ÄúJon Ossoff. A trail of dirty money. Ossoff ignored the rules, hiding cash from Chinese communists.‚Äù

The ad was referring to Ossoff‚Äôs initial financial disclosure filings for his Senate candidacy in May 2020. That filing showed that his media production company, Insight TWI, received more than $5,000 in the past two years from 21 TV or broadcasting groups from around the world.

Two months later, in July 2020, Ossoff amended that filing to include 32 companies, including PCCW Media Limited ‚Äî a Hong Kong-based Chinese media company that is partially owned by the Chinese state-run company China Unicom, led by a CCP member.

Ossoff campaign spokesperson Miryam Lipper told FactCheck.org in regard to the ad that Ossoff was not ‚Äúhiding‚Äù the payment and that it was a ‚Äúpaperwork oversight‚Äù that was ‚Äúrectified‚Äù after ‚Äúa normal review of the campaign‚Äôs paperwork.‚Äù

Lipper also wrote to FactCheck.org, ‚ÄúPCCW does not = Chinese communists.‚Äù

However, multiple media reports show direct ties between PCCW Media Limited and the CCP.

PCCW Media Limited is owned by Richard Li ‚Äî who has spoken out against pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, as well as owned by the Chinese state-owned China Unicom, which is run by CEO Wang Xiaochu, a member of the CCP.

Li has a long track record of supporting Beijing. According to the National Review, in 2016, Li released a public statement that said he was ‚Äústaunchly opposed to the independence of Hong Kong.‚Äù

‚ÄúMr. Richard Li and MOOV would like to clearly state that the company and Mr. Li respect freedom of expression,‚Äù the statement said. ‚ÄúHowever, both Mr. Li and the Company are staunchly opposed to the independence of Hong Kong and it is their view that the independence of Hong Kong would not be feasible, and discussing Hong Kong‚Äôs independence is a waste of society‚Äôs resources.‚Äù

At the height of the democracy protests in 2019, Li took out full-page advertisements in seven newspapers to call for the restoration of ‚Äúthe social order with the rule of law,‚Äù backing the recommendations of Beijing‚Äôs Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council, according to the National Review.

And Li‚Äôs father, Li Ka-shing, reportedly the richest man in Hong Kong, publicly backed the CCP‚Äôs sweeping national security law in 2020 to crack down on critics and dissenters.

Despite Lipper claiming that PCCW Media Limited ‚Äúdoes not = Chinese communists,‚Äù she still made an effort to distance Ossoff‚Äôs company from PCCW.

She claimed PCCW did not directly pay Insight TWI, despite Ossoff‚Äôs own filing listing the company as those that paid Insight TWI more than $5,000 in the past two years.

‚ÄúIn some instances, as is the case with PCCW, TWI even licenses the documentaries to distributors like Sky Vision who re-license them to TV stations,‚Äù Lipper claimed.

‚ÄúTWI would never have sold anything to PCCW directly, just received a royalty check from Sky Vision when PCCW ran TWI‚Äôs two investigations of ISIS war crimes,‚Äù she added.

She also asserted the payment did not mean PCCW controlled Ossoff.

The structure of Insight TWI ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt leave any room for this notion that he is somehow controlled by these groups in the nefarious way they try to imply,‚Äù she told FactCheck.org.

FactCheck.org also said support for the ad‚Äôs ‚Äúcharges is weak‚Äù and called PCCW Media Limited ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù ‚ÄúChinese communists.‚Äù

113,Rand Paul Urges Georgia Libertarians to ‚ÄòVote Republican‚Äô in Runoff,['Amy Furr'],"Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) is encouraging Libertarians in Georgia to vote Republican in the January Senate runoff race.

‚ÄúOne of the things that I‚Äôve taken upon myself is to try to encourage‚Ä¶ there was a little over 100,000 people who voted for Shane Hazel, the Libertarian candidate, and I think those people can find a place and reason to vote for Republicans,‚Äù he said Monday on Fox News.

Paul continued:

Look, I get fed up with the Republicans not spending money wisely and adding to our debt, but they are better than the Democrats. Even if only sometimes marginally so. But on some things, like packing the court and D.C. statehood, Republicans will help to protect the country from all branches of government being controlled by the Democrats. So, I think there is some argument‚Ä¶ some of these 100,000 Libertarians to actually vote Republican and I‚Äôm gonna be spending some time trying to encourage them to vote Republican in the runoff.

Democrats from outside the state are trying to create division among Republicans in Georgia.

‚ÄúThe Democrats then intend to exploit those divisions to try to drive down turnout among President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters in the runoff for the two U.S. Senate seats that will decide which party controls the upper chamber of Congress next year,‚Äù Breitbart News reported.

‚ÄúRepublicans, meanwhile, are pushing back on these efforts, calling them ‚Äòdeceitful campaign tactics‚Äô designed to ‚Äòmanipulate voters‚Äô in Georgia,‚Äù it continued.

A recent ad by the Georgia Republican Party said illegal aliens will earn the right to vote if Americans do not vote in the runoff elections.

‚ÄúWhen the radicals say ‚Äòchange America,‚Äô this is what they mean: opening the border, illegal immigrants voting, total Democrat control,‚Äù the narrator states:

114,Democrat Jaime Harrison Launches PAC for Runoffs After Record-Breaking Loss in South Carolina,['Ashley Oliver'],"Democrat Jaime Harrison, who ran against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in South Carolina and lost in the most expensive defeat in U.S. Senate race history, announced Tuesday the launch of a political action committee (PAC) aimed at boosting Democrats in Georgia‚Äôs Senate runoff election.

Harrison, who has also been floated as the next Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair, announced the launch of Dirt Road PAC Monday morning on MSNBC‚Äôs Morning Joe. Harrison said he first plans to raise money for Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, who are challenging Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in Georgia‚Äôs high-profile Senate runoff races on January 5:

The new fundraising effort comes on the heels of Harrison outspending any Senate candidate in U.S. history, at $104.1 million, in an attempt to oust Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Graham. Harrison lost to Graham by a definitive margin of ten points.

‚ÄúRome wasn‚Äôt built in a day; South Carolina won‚Äôt flip overnight, but if you sustain the investment in these communities, we‚Äôll see the change that is so necessary and so needed,‚Äù Harrison said on MSNBC as he rationalized his continued pursuit of political donations.

Host Joe Scarborough praised Harrison‚Äôs Senate bid and questioned if South Carolina was ‚Äújust a state that Democrats aren‚Äôt going to be able to win for a very long time‚Äù:

You had so many advantages in this race. You had all the money any candidate could ever dream of having. You ran what most thought was a very effective race against an ineffective opponent, who at times seemed desperate, seemed whiney, had broken his promise to South Carolina voters time and time again ‚Ä¶ and yet Lindsey Graham won the race handily. Is South Carolina just a state that Democrats aren‚Äôt going to be able to win for a very long time?

Harrison responded by emphasizing that flipping red areas to blue requires a ‚Äúlong-term and sustained approach.‚Äù

Harrison‚Äôs PAC launch is one of several Democrat fundraising endeavors zoned in on the consequential Georgia runoff races, which will determine which party next controls the Senate majority. Activist Stacey Abrams, who dropped $10 million at the start of the runoffs through her organization Fair Fight, announced Saturday that Fair Fight will pump $2.7 million into smaller groups intending to strengthen their ‚Äúget-out-the-vote apparatus.‚Äù

Other big names stepping in for the runoffs include Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), former Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D), and ‚ÄúSquad‚Äù leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

As for Harrison‚Äôs PAC, beyond Georgia, the South Carolina Democrat intends to direct funds toward Virginia‚Äôs 2021 elections, voter registration efforts, and the 2022 midterm elections.

In the Veep episode ‚ÄúMother,‚Äù the Selina Meyer campaign hopes to end the electoral stalemate with the Nevada recount, but things don‚Äôt go as planned. The political cliffhanger comes as Meyer‚Äôs elderly mother suffers a massive stroke, sending Selina into an emotional tailspin.

Louis-Dreyfus previously held a Veep reunion-fundraiser for Wisconsin Democrats in the run-up to the November 3 election. Key counties in the state are undergoing a recount after Milwaukee and Dane counties saw late surges in votes for former Vice President Joe Biden.

The Georgia runoffs are set to take place January 5.

116,Fitton: Election Update,['Tom Fitton'],"If you want to effectively express your beliefs about this deliberately chaotic election, I urge you to contact your representatives in your state legislature and Congress. Especially if you live in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona ‚Äì cesspools of fraud and lawlessness all.

I described what we‚Äôre witnessing in an interview with Stephanie Hamill on One America News Network:

Americans see an election that‚Äôs been questioned because of substantial allegations of maladministration of the election ‚Äì that‚Äôs a charitable interpretation of it. And they know there‚Äôs an air of violence and censorship and suppression if they dare raise questions about it or support the president. We who are defending the rule of law are being lectured about the peaceful transfer of power by the likes of President Obama, who during his transition was actually conspiring against President Trump and spying on his team illicitly.

In her Newsmax television show Sovereign Nation, Michelle Malkin complimented Judicial Watch for our work on elections and suggested that we have earned the right to say, ‚ÄúI told you so.‚Äù I take no comfort in that because we have unprecedented fraud occurring across the country.

Michelle asked me what Judicial Watch doing about it. My response:

Our litigators and investigators are figuring out where we can make a stand to preserve the lawful election result. U.S. Code designates this past Tuesday as Election Day. That‚Äôs when we‚Äôre supposed to select the president. Any votes being counted that arrive after that day should be subject to challenge. And any vote counting that occurs after Election Day should be subject to challenge. When you have a pause in counting, that indicates that fraud has taken place.

This is what I said to my Twitter followers about our activity:

Americans should demand courts and state legislatures and Congress protect free and fair elections! Judicial Watch is conducting independent investigations in PA, GA, AZ, NV, MI, WI!

We don‚Äôt know how all of this will play out. The election may well end up in Congress, as I explain in this video:

The electors vote as part of the Electoral College process in the middle of December. Then on January 6, the new Congress is supposed to meet and count the votes and essentially confirm and ratify the Electoral College selection of the president and vice president. Now, if there‚Äôs a challenge, you could get a situation where the House, for instance, wants to bless the Biden electors out of Pennsylvania and the Senate wants to reject them. Frankly, I‚Äôm not sure what happens next.

We have observed and researched and litigated elections for decades, and, as you might imagine, we are following this one extremely closely. We will be deploying our weapon of choice, the Freedom of Information Act, to uncover the truth.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everytown originally announced its endorsement of Ossoff on September 15, 2020, then re-announced it following the development of a January 5, 2021, runoff between Ossoff and pro-Second Amendment Senator David Perdue (R-GA).

On November 8, 2020, Everytown posted their announcement of support for Ossoff in the runoff, making clear their backing includes the support of Bloomberg gun control subsidiary, Moms Demand Action for Gun Safety.

Everytown‚Äôs John Feinblatt said, ‚ÄúDavid Perdue‚Ä¶[has] declared fealty to the gun lobby and opposed bipartisan gun safety measures like background checks on all gun sales. Everytown‚Äôs grassroots army is ready to do the work to send David Perdue‚Ä¶packing.‚Äù

Moms Demand‚Äôs Shannon Watts said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre ready to send‚Ä¶David Perdue packing because instead of working for Georgians, [he‚Äôs] prioritized special interests like the gun lobby, pandered to extremists in their party, and catered to the views of right-wing conspiracy theorists.‚Äù

120,2017 Video Shows Democrat Raphael Warnock Believes ‚ÄòRacism‚Äô Is ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äôs Preexisting Condition‚Äô,['Ashley Oliver'],"Rev. Raphael Warnock preached in 2017 that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs preexisting condition‚Äù is ‚Äúracism‚Äù during at least two of the several speeches and sermons Warnock has given that have come under scrutiny for their radical messaging.

Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, said at a New Baptist Covenant event on June 29, 2017, that he ‚Äúwould not be a prophet‚Äù if he did not inform his audience ‚Äúthat racism is America‚Äôs preexisting condition‚Äù:



Warnock said in the clip New Baptist Covenant shared from the event:

We are in a special moment. We are in an evil moment. We are in a tragic moment, and I suggest to you that our politics is symptomatic of our sickness. We‚Äôve got a lot of problems, but I would not be a prophet if I did not tell you that racism is America‚Äôs preexisting condition. Like the insurance companies, nobody wants to go there. Nobody wants to cover it because we wonder what it would cost. We, the land of the free, and the incarceration capital of the world. In this land where we warehouse 25 percent of the world‚Äôs prisoners although we are only five percent of the world, we are to ask ourselves what has it cost us not to cover it, not to face up to it, not to confront it, not to deal with it. Racism is America‚Äôs preexisting condition.

Warnock also preached in a video compilation dubbed ‚Äú2017Year Ender‚Äù that racism, classism, bigotry, and xenophobia comprise America‚Äôs ‚Äúpreexisting condition‚Äù:

Warnock said, ‚ÄúAmerica has a preexisting condition. It‚Äôs called racism. It‚Äôs called classism. It‚Äôs called bigotry. It‚Äôs called xenophobia. And we need God to heal us of our preexisting condition.‚Äù

As Warnock pursues unseating Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in Georgia‚Äôs highly consequential Senate runoff race on January 5, Warnock‚Äôs connection to provocative and racially charged rhetoric has come into the spotlight.

Warnock appeared on Fox News in 2008 and defended Jeremiah Wright, who served as former pastor to President Barack Obama and is known for a number of incendiary statements ‚Äî which Obama himself has condemned ‚Äî including declaring that ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs chickens are coming home to roost‚Äù in regard to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and giving an impassioned speech in which he repeatedly shouted ‚ÄúGod damn America.‚Äù

Warnock said in 2016 just before the presidential election that ‚ÄúAmerica needs to repent for its worship of whiteness on full display.‚Äù

Warnock has twice praised Dr. James Cone and described Cone as his ‚Äúmentor.‚Äù Cone claimed to fight racism but employed a wealth of anti-white language, including decrying ‚Äúsatanic whiteness‚Äù and calling for the ‚Äúdestruction of everything white‚Äù in society.

In addition to comparing racism in America to a preexisting medical condition, Warnock has made a string of anti-police remarks, including that ‚Äúwe shouldn‚Äôt be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street‚Äù and that ‚Äúoften those who are sworn to protect cause more trouble.‚Äù

Warnock responded to criticism of his past comments in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution interview in March this year, saying, ‚ÄúAny fair-thinking person would recognize that everything a government does, even the American government, is not consistent with God‚Äôs dream for the world.‚Äù

Warnock is running against incumbent Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), alongside another Georgia Senate run-off race between Jon Ossoff and incumbent Sen. David Perdue (R-GA).

Republicans have 50 seats in the Senate, and if Democrats win the two Georgia run-off races, they will tie Republicans for control of the U.S. Senate, with Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) casting the deciding vote should she become vice president.

Democrats hope to gain control of the upper chamber in addition to the House to push through major reforms in a prospective Biden administration. A Republican-controlled Senate would provide a backstop against that.

While Warnock‚Äôs campaign claims that he does not want to defund the police, Working Families Party has been clear about its aims.

122,"Democrats Aim to Create, Exploit Divisions Among GOP in Georgia",['Matthew Boyle'],"Democrats from outside Georgia are actively engaged in an effort to create divisions among Republicans in the state.

The Democrats then intend to exploit those divisions to try to drive down turnout among President Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters in the runoff for the two U.S. Senate seats that will decide which party controls the upper chamber of Congress next year. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing back on these efforts, calling them ‚Äúdeceitful campaign tactics‚Äù designed to ‚Äúmanipulate voters‚Äù in Georgia.

Really American PAC, a leftwing Super PAC that ran scores of attack ads against President Trump in the general election in 2020, is now crowdfunding on social media to fund billboards in Trump-supporter-heavy areas of Georgia to split Trump supporters from Sens. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and David Perdue (R-GA). Both GOP senators are headed to Jan. 5 runoffs in the state that will determine which party controls the U.S. Senate next year. As of now, next year Republicans will have 50 seats in the U.S. Senate and Democrats will have 48. These two seats will determine which party controls the Senate, and if the Democrats take both of them‚Äîand Democrat presidential candidate Joe Biden is successful in challenges from President Donald Trump to election results that currently have Biden leading Trump‚Äîthen the Democrats would gain control of the chamber as the would-be Vice President Kamala Harris, now a Democrat senator from California, would be the tie-breaking vote.

As Trump is challenging the election results in Georgia and other states around the country, the Democrats are now trying to imply that Loeffler and Perdue have been insufficiently loyal to the president.

The billboards Really American PAC is seeking to post around Georgia explicitly state this in text that appears alongside images of Loeffler and Perdue: ‚ÄúGeorgia Republicans Didn‚Äôt Fight For Trump. We Won‚Äôt Fight For Them.‚Äù

This revelation that key figures in the Democrat Party‚Äîwho stand to benefit politically from a Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate if their candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock defeat Perdue and Loeffler respectively‚Äîare behind these attempts to create such divisions comes as no surprise to Trump supporters, who are acutely aware that the president‚Äôs supporters are firmly behind the GOP candidates for U.S. Senate in Georgia in the runoffs.

In particular, as Breitbart News reported earlier on Monday, Donald Trump Jr.‚ÄîPresident Trump‚Äôs eldest son‚Äîput to bed any suggestion that Trump supporters should be thinking about sitting out the runoff elections in Georgia.

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of talk from people that are supposed to be on our side telling GOP voters not to go out & vote for @KLoeffler and @PerdueSenate. That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people. We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.#MAGA #GASEN ‚Äî Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 23, 2020

In response to the Breitbart News article, some of those on the right who had been hyping these concerns about Republicans sitting out the election‚Äîlike activist Ali Alexander, who‚Äôs been behind many of the #StopTheSteal rallies around the country‚Äîassured followers there is no division and Trump supporters will rally behind Loeffler and Perdue.

Trump Jr. Urges Georgians to Back Loeffler, Perdue in Senate Runoffs We will all work this out üá∫üá∏ https://t.co/rWNDXX7HlF ‚Äî Ali #StopTheSteal (@ali) November 23, 2020

We will all be on the same page by Jan 5th. Don‚Äôt attack Don Jr, Lin, me or anyone rowing in the same general direction. I don‚Äôt have time for people cashing in past personal vendettas. If you want to boost GOP Turnout take any action to secure our elections NOW! #ProTip ONWARDüá∫üá∏ ‚Äî Ali #StopTheSteal (@ali) November 23, 2020

Nationally syndicated radio host Rush Limbaugh also suggested on his program on Monday that Trump himself should head to Georgia to rally with the GOP Senators, as Vice President Mike Pence already has since the election. and others in Trump‚Äôs orbit have or intend to do soon.

The idea that Loeffler and Perdue have not stood with Trump all the way through this fight is on its face untrue. They both have issued statements in support of the president‚Äôs recount push and backed him at every turn‚Äîand again, the Trump administration knows this, which is why Pence held two rallies last week with the two senators.

When asked about these billboards from Democrats seeking to divide Republicans, the Georgia Republican Party dismissed them as ‚Äúdeceitful campaign tactics‚Äù designed to ‚Äúmanipulate voters.‚Äù

‚ÄúDemocrats are desperate to elect Radical Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff so they can implement Schumer and Pelosi‚Äôs radical socialist agenda, and unfortunately for Georgians, that includes deceitful campaign tactics to manipulate voters,‚Äù Georgia GOP spokeswoman Abigail Sigler told Breitbart News. ‚ÄúBut their attempts to divide Republicans are pointless. Georgians know that Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue continue to stand with our President.‚Äù

Really American PAC had tweeted the images of the planned billboards and a plea that linked to a fundraising page on ActBlue, the formal Democrat Party fundraising platform. When Breitbart News asked the organization for comment, the group declined‚Äîand then the original tweet disappeared.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre crowdfunding billboards in counties that went for Trump in Georgia to let Trump supporters know that the GA Republicans didn‚Äôt fight for them, they shouldn‚Äôt fight for Loeffler & Perdue,‚Äù the tweet read. It encouraged followers to retweet it, and ‚Äúchip in‚Äù to ‚Äúhelp get this done.‚Äù

As of publication of this article, though, the fundraising plea on ActBlue‚Äôs website is still active.

The ActBlue fundraising plea for the Really American PAC billboards goes even further than the tweet does in attempting to create and foment intra-GOP divisions to help the Democrats take the Senate.

The Democrats‚Äô fundraising website reads:

Trump supporters in Georgia are saying that because David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler couldn‚Äôt deliver a victory in Georgia for Trump, MAGA supporters should not deliver a victory for them in the run-off election. We agree. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre crowdfunding these billboards in the counties in Georgia that voted for Trump in the highest numbers: Georgia Republicans Didn‚Äôt Fight For Trump. We Won‚Äôt Fight For Them.

The battle in Georgia could determine a lot about the future of the country. If Biden does end up overcoming the election challenges from Trump and remains in the lead, then the GOP having a majority in the Senate would be a check on a Biden administration. If the Democrats did take control of the Senate, they would, even though they would have a very slim majority, control the floor and committees in such a scenario that the people of Georgia could stop if they reelect Sens. Perdue and Loeffler.

It remains to be seen what will happen, but Democrats are already aggressively pursuing these seats, as evidenced by this billboard campaign and by efforts that failed former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams is leading to stuff as many absentee ballots into the public sphere as she can ahead of the election. Abrams bragged earlier on Monday about how, according to her claims, more than three quarters of a million such ballot requests had gone out already after the state began sending them out a few days ago.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
123,"Georgia GOP Ad: If Americans Do Not Vote, Illegal Aliens Will",['John Binder'],"A new ad by the Georgia Republican Party is stating that illegal aliens will earn the right to vote if Americans do not vote in the Senate runoff elections where Senators David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) are facing Democrat challengers.

An ad running in the state quotes Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and failed Democrat gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams discussing changing the United States amid a ‚Äúblue wave.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow we take Georgia. Then we change America,‚Äù the ad quotes Schumer saying. ‚ÄúWhen the radicals say, ‚ÄòChange America,‚Äô this is what they mean: Opening the border, illegal immigrants voting, total Democrat control.‚Äù

When the radicals say ‚Äúchange America,‚Äù they mean: opening the border and allowing illegal immigrants voting. Georgia, go vote, because if you don‚Äôt, illegal immigrants will. pic.twitter.com/az2pKjnhNr ‚Äî GAGOP (@GaRepublicans) November 23, 2020

‚ÄúBut the thing of it is, the blue wave ‚Ä¶ is comprised of those who are documented and undocumented,‚Äù Abrams says in the ad.

‚ÄúSave Georgia. Save America,‚Äù the ad continues. ‚ÄúGo vote because if you don‚Äôt, illegal immigrants will.‚Äù

Abigail Sigler, a spokeswoman for the Georgia GOP called Perdue and Loeffler‚Äôs Democrat challengers, Raphael Warnock and Jon Osoff, ‚Äúradical,‚Äù with plans for amnesty to 11 to 22 million illegal aliens.

‚ÄúRadical Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff have made it clear they would go to Washington to be rubber stamps for Schumer‚Äôs extreme radical agenda, which includes giving illegal immigrants the right to vote,‚Äù Sigler said in a statement.

‚ÄúThe stakes in the election could not be higher, and Georgians who want to protect the American way of life we treasure must support Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for Senate,‚Äù Sigler said.

Should the Georgia Senate seats flip, Democrats would have majorities in the House and Senate with a potential incoming Joe Biden administration. Earlier this year, House Democrats attempted to implement a quasi-amnesty for illegal aliens in the workforce in a coronavirus relief package, along with nationwide ballot harvesting.

President Trump gave his first post-election interview to Maria Bartiromo on her Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures. During the phone interview, the president attacked the mainstream media for its refusal to run negative stories about Joe Biden, calling it ‚Äúsuppression by the press.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression by the press. They suppress,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a scandal if nobody reports about it. This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint.‚Äù

Jimmy Kimmel used the Fox News interview to mock Bartiromo, calling her ‚Äúalways sycophantic‚Äù when it comes to the president.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened to her, but she appears to be auditioning for the position of Donald Trump‚Äôs next wife because that was some interview,‚Äù he said.

125,David Mamet Calls Out ‚ÄòExperts‚Äô and Questions Lockdowns: ‚ÄòThe Virus Here Is Government‚Äô,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

‚ÄúThe virus here is government‚Äîor at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,‚Äù Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence‚Äîand they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ ‚Äî WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

‚ÄúWe all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.‚Äù

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. ‚ÄúOne is ‚Äòpermitted‚Äô to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?‚Äù

David Mamet compares today‚Äôs coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin‚Äôs science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. ‚ÄúNow we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe news media, backed by those parts of the ‚Äòscientific community‚Äô the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.‚Äù

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

‚ÄúA pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.‚Äù

126,BBC Studios Imposes 20 Percent Diversity Quota on All New Productions,['David Ng'],"BBC Studios, the largest producer of content in Great Britain, is imposing a 20 percent diversity quota on all new productions in an apparent effort to boost the visibility of ethnic minorities, LGBTQ individuals, and people with disabilities.

The studio announced the quotas on Monday, saying in a press release that the new ‚Äúinclusion rider‚Äù is effective immediately and will apply to on-screen talent and well as behind-the-scenes staff on all new BBC and third-party U.K. commissions. The rider targets so-called ‚ÄúBAME‚Äù individuals ‚Äî black, Asian, minority ethnic people, as well as the disabled and low-income individuals.

‚ÄúThese initiatives are by no means a magic bullet and we‚Äôre also doing a lot of work on culture and education to make our teams more inclusive,‚Äù Ralph Lee, BBC Studios‚Äô director of content, said in a statement. ‚ÄúThe talent in front of and behind the camera will give perspectives that will shape our content, making it more authentic and universal in its depiction of our audiences ‚Äî and ultimately its appeal with them.‚Äù

BBC Studios said that LGBTQ talent won‚Äôt be eligible for off-screen quotas because the company ‚Äúhas already exceeded this target.‚Äù

Among the most popular shows from BBC Studios are Top Gear, Doctor Who, Good Omens, Luther, and the long-running EastEnders. The studio, which is the production arm of the BBC, also creates content for distributors around the world, including Amazon, Apple, and China Mobile.

The initiative is the latest move by the entertainment industry to impose diversity quotas on movies and TV shows. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September that movies must reach certain quotas for women, ethnic minorities, disabled, and LGBTQ people if they are to be considered for the best picture Oscars category.

128,"Barbra Streisand Gushes: Biden Will ‚ÄòBring Back Dignity, Honesty, Intelligence, and Compassion‚Äô",['David Ng'],"Barbra Streisand is ‚Äúexhilarated‚Äù about the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president, saying that Biden will ‚Äúbring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office.‚Äù

The Oscar-winning Hollywood leftist also bashed President Donald Trump in an interview with the New York Times, calling him a liar and blaming him for the loss of ‚Äúthousands of lives.‚Äù The accusation is one that Streisand has repeatedly made on social media, having previously claimed that President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúincompetence and lies‚Äù are responsible for thousands of coronavirus fatalities.

In her talk with the Time‚Äôs T style magazine, Barbra Streisand expressed her thrill at the possibility of Joe Biden, who recently broke his foot, taking office. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhilarated ‚Ä¶ [He] will bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office. I look forward to that.‚Äù

Neither Streisand nor the Times reporter brought up the Hunter Biden scandal or Tara Reade‚Äôs sexual assault allegations against the presidential hopeful.The singer-actress was a major supporter of Biden‚Äôs campaign, participating in several Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic candidate.

‚ÄúWhat do I hate most about Trump? He lies every day,‚Äù she told the Times. ‚ÄúHe has the compulsion to lie, even when the facts say something different. The worst lie was about the pandemic. Why not face facts? Why not tell the truth? People are stronger than you think ‚Äî they can handle the truth. It would have saved thousands of lives.‚Äù

Streisand didn‚Äôt clarify her allegation claiming that the president has lied about the pandemic. She also omitted the fact the President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, which fast-tracked a public-private partnership with drug makers to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The project has yielded vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that are expected to start reaching the public in December.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added her praise for Streisand to the article, lauding the Hollywood celebrity for her political activism that started before it became fashionable.

‚ÄúIt took real courage back then to get involved because the entertainment industry believed there‚Äôd be a backlash,‚Äù Pelosi told the Times. Streisand in fundraising mode ‚Äúis dazzling to behold,‚Äù Pelosi added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just because she‚Äôs a celebrity. She knows the issues. She‚Äôs studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs persuasive.‚Äù

Pelosi continued: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have to do this‚Ä¶ She does it out of patriotism. She loves our country.‚Äù

Streisand also told the Times that she reached out to the daughter of George Floyd shortly after he died while in Minneapolis policy custody, setting off race riots around the country.

Streisand said she sent six-year-old Gianna some shares of Disney stock, along with a letter in which she recounted how she also lost her father at a young age.

‚ÄúI think our dads watch over us forever,‚Äù Streisand wrote, according to the Times. ‚ÄúWhen you get older and have a decision to make ‚Ä¶ just close your eyes and ask him for help. And if you listen very carefully, he will lead you to the right choice. I promise!‚Äù

Among the most popular shows from BBC Studios are Top Gear, Doctor Who, Good Omens, Luther, and the long-running EastEnders. The studio, which is the production arm of the BBC, also creates content for distributors around the world, including Amazon, Apple, and China Mobile.

The initiative is the latest move by the entertainment industry to impose diversity quotas on movies and TV shows. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September that movies must reach certain quotas for women, ethnic minorities, disabled, and LGBTQ people if they are to be considered for the best picture Oscars category.

135,Nolte: Coronavirus Speeds Up the Napster-ization of Movies,['John Nolte'],"Back in 1999, Napster killed the music business forever. And now what happened to music 20 years ago is happening to the movie business ‚Äî and that is a critical piece of analysis missing from this piece from the far-left New York Times looking at the demise of films.

Napster annihilated the music business when it took music digital and got everyone used to not paying much of anything for music. Who‚Äôs going to pay for music after you‚Äôre used to not paying for it?

Worse though, Napster cheapened music. Not to go all In my day on everyone, but there‚Äôs a reason why the biggest music names touring the past few years are almost all aged 80 to 40. Elton John, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones, KISS, Cher, Garth Brooks, Bob Seger, Phil Collins, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Pink, Eminem, Journey, Def Leppard, U2, Sting, Backstreet Boys, Scorpions, Rod Stewart, Celine Dion, Guns n‚Äô Roses, Justin Timberlake. Sure, Ariana Grande is on the list. I‚Äôm sure a Beyonce or Taylor Swift can fill a venue, but this is like growing up in the 80s and 90s and the biggest grossing tours are Bill Haley and the Comets, the Platters, the Four Seasons, Paul Anka, and Frankie Avalon.

In my day ‚Äî sorry to do that to you again ‚Äî new music was a big deal. You didn‚Äôt hit a button on your Spotify account to listen to it. You saved your money. You went out and bought the album. You recorded the album on cassette so you wouldn‚Äôt wear out the vinyl and could listen to it in your car. You put on headphones. Laid down on the bed. Listened to both sides, and when you flipped it over you were careful not to touch anything but the edges, and then you stared at the album cover the whole time ‚Äî read the liner notes. Then your friends came over. You listened to it again and again, talked about it, and waited to see what the first top 40 single would be.

There‚Äôs none of that now. Music is just a commodity today, a product, and oftentimes a product used to sell another product. You listen, you move on. The specialness is gone. The sense that a new release is meaningful is gone. Worse still, the sense the art itself is meaningful, that it speaks to you in some way, is gone. It‚Äôs all just disposable junk now. That, by the way, is not my commentary on the quality of today‚Äôs music, but how people perceive music today.

Music is now just something else on the Internet, like a YouTube video or tweet or blog post. What used to fill a meaningful gap in people‚Äôs lives now just fills four minutes of their time.

This is what‚Äôs going to happen to movies, and what has been happening to movies for a long while now‚Ä¶

And when I talk about movies, I‚Äôm talking about movie-movies, not TV movies.

I really enjoyed Martin Scorsese‚Äôs The Irishman, but it was a made-for-TV movie (Netflix) and is therefore a TV movie‚Äì a point I‚Äôll circle back to in a bit. But let‚Äôs first look at how Hollywood had already cheapened the art, even before the coronavirus hit‚Ä¶

When movies were still around what were they? It was all CGI and spectacle and a big roller coaster ride. Except for cheapie horror, movies had become one big and bloated $400 million gamble after another, and with Marvel having run its course with the Avengers, and Disney running out of cartoons to bring to real (CGI) life and the DC brand running more cold than hot, and the Fast and Furious crew about to qualify for AARP, the movie business was already about to hit a wall and was already becoming something hollow and forgettable.

Sure, some of these movies are a good time, but so is reading Twitter and watching YouTube.

Art is more than a good time. It stays with you, affects you, maybe even changes you; it inspires you, makes you think, makes you want to re-experience it thinking you might have missed a deeper meaning that first time. Yeah, sure, there are exceptions that tell a human story, a Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or Ford v. Ferrari, but those are exceptions. Rare exceptions.

I just wonder, now that the coronavirus has shut the movie business down, are people really missing it?

And now that the coronavirus is forcing blockbuster movies like Soul and Wonder Woman 1984 and Coming to America 2 and Mulan and a whole bunch of others to go direct to streaming, that means the movies are one step closer to Napster-izing themselves. All these movies are going to go the route of The Irishman ‚Äî cheapened and lost in the literal bottomless black hole that is Netflix‚Äôs (or whoever‚Äôs) endless selection.

We watch the Irishman and Hillbilly Elegy and countless others just like them as though they are commodities, time fillers, and with streaming blowing up like it has, with it becoming a primary source of income for the studios, we‚Äôre going to see a whole lot more movies cheapened in the same way ‚Äî most of them, in fact.

And no, it‚Äôs not like when a movie would premier on TV before there was home video, which used to be a big deal, an event. Or when a movie premiered on home video, which was also something to get excited over. Because those movies had been in theaters, so they came with that imprimatur, and that imprimatur meant something. And they were more than just a video game or roller coaster ride brought to life.

Now, no matter how good or great it is, countless movies (and more are coming) are dumped in the massive universe of the streaming carousel, just another digital product, just another tweet, just another YouTube video to fill your day.

Music used to be special. Now it‚Äôs not.

Movies used to be special, and now they are less so every day.

136,Nolte: Coronavirus Catastrophe at Thanksgiving Box Office,['John Nolte'],"The Croods: New Age, the top movie over the Thanksgiving weekend, grossed a terrible $14.2 million. That was over the five-day weekend ‚Äî meaning Wednesday through Sunday. Over three days (Friday- Sunday), it grossed just $9.7 million.

A good faith look at the top ten movies over Thanksgiving weekend finds that they did not top $20 million total. What I mean is that all ten movies did not bring in more than $20 million together. Three of the movies in the top ten are old enough to drive: Elf (2003), The Santa Clause (1994), and Christmas Vacation (1989).

What‚Äôs interesting, though, is that Croods: New Age bottomed out with just $14.2 million over five days, even though it was released in 2,211 theaters. That‚Äôs a lot of theaters. Granted, that‚Äôs about half the number of theaters it would have been released into in pre-coronavirus America but that‚Äôs still a sizable number of theaters, enough theaters ‚Äî even with social distancing, to gross a respectable amount, which tells me that even though theaters are open near them, people are still not going to the movies.

For example, last Thanksgiving, Frozen II was playing on 4,440 screens and grossed $34.1 million on Thanksgiving Day alone. Just on that one day. Over that five day weekend, it cleared $110 million on only twice as many screens as the Croods. I should also point out that was Frozen II‚Äôs second weekend, not its opening weekend.

So the number of screens is not the problem in the age of the coronavirus. The problem is that people aren‚Äôt going to the movies even where they can go to the movies.

The horror film Freaky, in its third week of release, grossed just $1.1 million in 1,735 theaters. Over the course of its run, it‚Äôs grossed just $7 million, so social distancing or not, it is playing to very, very empty houses.

Keep in mind that movie theaters are only open in areas where the government is telling people it is safe to go to the movies, where movies theaters are practicing social distancing. Nevertheless, people still aren‚Äôt going.

People who can go to the movies are not going to the movies.

No wonder Hollywood is worried.

137,Ted Cruz Hammers Alyssa Milano On Coronavirus Aid: ‚ÄòEvery Senate Dem Voted to Block Relief‚Äô,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R, TX) called out leftist actress Alyssa Milano for her attack on Republican lawmakers blocking a recent coronavirus relief bill after she ignored months of Democrats blocking similar financial relief bills.

Alyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday to slap congressional Republicans for blocking a minimum wage hike and a coronavirus relief bill for working-class families. Milano posted her tweet as a reply to an earlier tweet by Sen. Cruz, in which he noted the statistics proving that the Democrats are now the party of the super-rich, coastal elites while the GOP has become the party of working class Americans.

This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it‚Äôs the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down. ‚Äî Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 29, 2020

The Charmed star questioned Cruz‚Äô contention that the GOP is now the party of the working classes by noting that the GOP had blocked the coronavirus bill. ‚ÄúThis is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it‚Äôs the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down,‚Äù Milnao tweeted on Sunday.

It is not exactly clear what bills Milano was speaking about but it is possible she was referring to the latest $15 Minimum Wage increase that died in the Senate. And she could be referring to Senate leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs decision back in October to ignore Democrat Chuck Schumer‚Äôs attempt to force the upper chamber to discuss a second $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

Schumer wanted to debate his relief bill when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was being confirmed. It would have restored the $600-per-week federal unemployment boost and would have sent another $1,200 stimulus check to Americans.

But Senator Cruz quickly pushed back. The Texas Senator noted that Milano conveniently ignored the many months that Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate blocked the GOP‚Äôs $500 billion coronavirus aid bill.

‚ÄúAlyssa, facts matter,‚Äù Cruz tweeted back to Milano. ‚ÄúDems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief. EVERY SINGLE Senate Dem voted to block relief‚ÄîPelosi refuses even to talk‚Äîbc they believe maximizing economic pain helped Biden & it helps Dems in GA. & they trust the press to cover for them.‚Äù

138,"Joy Behar: If Hillary Clinton Won, U.S. Would Not Be Number One in Coronavirus Cases, Deaths",['Pam Key'],"Co-host Joy Behar said on Monday‚Äôs broadcast of ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù that if Hillary Clinton had won the 2016 presidential election, the United States would not be ‚Äúnumber one in the world in COVID cases and COVID deaths.‚Äù

During a discussion on Joe Biden‚Äôs all-female communication team picks, Behar said, ‚ÄúI think Joe Biden is now demonstrating correctly that women can run things really well, and we‚Äôre all going to be a witness to it. He‚Äôs got Kamala Harris in the second position, you know, that‚Äôs the first time we‚Äôve seen that. Let the world see how well women can do when put in the spot when they can do the job.‚Äù

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, ‚ÄúJoy, to your point, we know that women leaders have done really well when it comes to the pandemic response, right? Think about Australia and New Zealand. They‚Äôre proven to be effective leaders time and time again. If you look at any study, and I mean Harvard has a tremendous amount of data on this, women have in comparison to men, I hate to say it, but it‚Äôs true, have more leadership skills when given the opportunity.

139,"Barbra Streisand Gushes: Biden Will ‚ÄòBring Back Dignity, Honesty, Intelligence, and Compassion‚Äô",['David Ng'],"Barbra Streisand is ‚Äúexhilarated‚Äù about the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president, saying that Biden will ‚Äúbring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office.‚Äù

The Oscar-winning Hollywood leftist also bashed President Donald Trump in an interview with the New York Times, calling him a liar and blaming him for the loss of ‚Äúthousands of lives.‚Äù The accusation is one that Streisand has repeatedly made on social media, having previously claimed that President Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúincompetence and lies‚Äù are responsible for thousands of coronavirus fatalities.

In her talk with the Time‚Äôs T style magazine, Barbra Streisand expressed her thrill at the possibility of Joe Biden, who recently broke his foot, taking office. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm exhilarated ‚Ä¶ [He] will bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office. I look forward to that.‚Äù

Neither Streisand nor the Times reporter brought up the Hunter Biden scandal or Tara Reade‚Äôs sexual assault allegations against the presidential hopeful.The singer-actress was a major supporter of Biden‚Äôs campaign, participating in several Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic candidate.

‚ÄúWhat do I hate most about Trump? He lies every day,‚Äù she told the Times. ‚ÄúHe has the compulsion to lie, even when the facts say something different. The worst lie was about the pandemic. Why not face facts? Why not tell the truth? People are stronger than you think ‚Äî they can handle the truth. It would have saved thousands of lives.‚Äù

Streisand didn‚Äôt clarify her allegation claiming that the president has lied about the pandemic. She also omitted the fact the President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, which fast-tracked a public-private partnership with drug makers to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The project has yielded vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that are expected to start reaching the public in December.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added her praise for Streisand to the article, lauding the Hollywood celebrity for her political activism that started before it became fashionable.

‚ÄúIt took real courage back then to get involved because the entertainment industry believed there‚Äôd be a backlash,‚Äù Pelosi told the Times. Streisand in fundraising mode ‚Äúis dazzling to behold,‚Äù Pelosi added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just because she‚Äôs a celebrity. She knows the issues. She‚Äôs studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs persuasive.‚Äù

Pelosi continued: ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt have to do this‚Ä¶ She does it out of patriotism. She loves our country.‚Äù

Streisand also told the Times that she reached out to the daughter of George Floyd shortly after he died while in Minneapolis policy custody, setting off race riots around the country.

Streisand said she sent six-year-old Gianna some shares of Disney stock, along with a letter in which she recounted how she also lost her father at a young age.

‚ÄúI think our dads watch over us forever,‚Äù Streisand wrote, according to the Times. ‚ÄúWhen you get older and have a decision to make ‚Ä¶ just close your eyes and ask him for help. And if you listen very carefully, he will lead you to the right choice. I promise!‚Äù

140,ABC‚Äôs Hostin: Trump ‚ÄòIs in a Psychosis‚Äô ‚Äî Needs ‚Äòto Go to Losers Anonymous‚Äô,['Pam Key'],"Co-host and network legal analyst Sunny Hostin said on Monday‚Äôs broadcast of ABC‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe View‚Äù that President Donald Trump is ‚Äúreally in a psychosis right now‚Äù in how he is reacting to the 2020 election.

Whoopi Goldberg said, ‚ÄúYesterday you-know-who gave his first post-election loss interview to Maria Bartiromo where he continued his claims of a rigged election and even threw his own intelligence agencies under the bus. Now take a look.‚Äù

In a Fox News clip, Trump said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way Joe Biden beat Barack Obama in the black communities of various cities, and then he did very badly compared to Obama in other cities throughout the United States. There‚Äôs no way it happened. This election was a fraud. It was a rigged election.‚Äù

Hostin said, ‚ÄúI mean, some of the claims he made in the interview yesterday were so outrageous. It‚Äôs, you know, especially when he talked about black voters, Whoopi. It just seems to me that he is surprised that all the attempts at voter suppression, all the attempts at gerrymandering, all the attempts at screwing around with the U.S. Postal Service, those attempts were ineffective, and our, you know, our institutions held. I think that is what is surprising this president and his supporters because we know that that‚Äôs what was at play, especially in a place like Georgia. That was certainly at play in Michigan and Detroit. They really attacked black constituents, black voters. That was the plan, and it just didn‚Äôt work. Probably because of people like LaTosha Brown and Stacey Abrams, right? I think that‚Äôs where the surprise is coming from.‚Äù

She continued, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs also fascinating, he just needs to go to losers anonymous, and he is really in a psychosis right now. I‚Äôm surprised that the people around him like his daughter, like Jared Kushner, who somehow is on his way to the Middle East. I don‚Äôt understand why he has to go to the Middle East today or this week. I think they need to stage some sort of intervention at this point because he is now damaging the Republican Party even further with all of this rhetoric.‚Äù

141,Music Festivals Offer to Put on Mass Vaccinations in Belgium,['Breitbart London'],"BRUSSELS (AP) ‚Äì With nothing on their agendas for months to come, music festival organizers in Belgium want to use their know-how to help the country‚Äôs coronavirus vaccination campaign.

The Belgian government has set a goal of vaccinating about 70% of the country‚Äôs population, about 8 million people, when approved COVID-19 vaccination shots become available.

As the vaccines are expected to arrive in multi-dose vials for shots to be administered all on the same day, Belgium health authorities are planning to vaccinate people in groups as much as possible. The task will pose many logistical challenges, including the creation of vaccination centers that festival organizers say they can help set up.

Enjoying a strong reputation in the music world, Belgian festival experts have proven experience in both building huge pop-up structures and in crowd management.

With the music industry hit hard by the pandemic‚Äôs economic, several festivals in the French-speaking region of Wallonia and the Brussels area have created a federation to better defend their interests. They have a large network of technicians who are currently unemployed and are ready to help out.

‚ÄúOur sector has been at a standstill for many months, and our many staff are eager to bring their creativity and dedication to the fight against coronavirus,‚Äù said federation president Damien Dufrasne.

One of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, Belgium has reported some 577,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,500 deaths linked to the virus.

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said COVID-19 vaccinations could start in the European Union‚Äôs 27 nations before the end of December. The commission, the EU¬¥s executive arm, has agreements with six potential vaccine suppliers and is working on a seventh contract. The deals allow it to purchase over 1.2 billion doses, more than double the population of the EU.

142,Delingpole: Laurence Fox Has Lunch with Friends. Quick! Fine Him!,['James Delingpole'],"Actor turned political activist Laurence Fox is in trouble again.

He enjoyed a lunch with friends, gave them hugs, then boasted about it on Twitter.

Here is the shocking proof:

Just had a large group over to lunch and we hugged and ate and talked and put the world to rights. It was lovely. You‚Äôll never take that away from people. Stay out. Protect your rights. If the @nhs can‚Äôt cope, then the @nhs isn‚Äôt fit for purpose. Compliance is violence. ‚Äî Laurence Fox (@LozzaFox) November 29, 2020

In a decade or so‚Äôs time, when historians look back on the madness of 2020, they are going to examine tweets like this in a state of utter disbelief.

‚ÄúCan it really be that in 2020 the very act of having lunch with a bunch of people, talking to them and hugging them was considered to be something dangerously reactionary and irresponsible?‚Äù they‚Äôll ask.

And for confirmation, they‚Äôll only have to look at some of the responses.

Here‚Äôs a snitch called Darryl ‚Äî one of several ‚Äî who wants to report Fox to the police and land him a ¬£10,000 fine.

@metpoliceuk Hello. I‚Äôd like to report a breach of the lockdown guidelines. Please ensure Mr Fox gets his ¬£10,000 fine. ‚Äî DarryI (@DarrylInnes) November 29, 2020

And here are a few more examples of the furious comments Fox received.

Get fucked, you desperate, deranged, narcissistic gusset stain. I hope your sprouts get overcooked to mush and that the copy of The Wicker Man you put on your Christmas list turns out to be the Nicolas Cage remake. Dear oh dear, I can‚Äôt quite believe the sheer nerve of this. I am an actor, currently working within the NHS on a Covid contract to keep the wolf from the door until our industry recovers. Just can‚Äôt quite believe the brazen lack of respect for what is right. And when one of that group falls ill and they and their family suffers as have people I have known, remember your freedom. Lets hope it‚Äôs not when you are on a ventilator. Exceptionalism is not a vaccine Laurence. I know people who‚Äôve died, people I loved. I‚Äôm currently Covid positive, it‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs awful. Messages like this, some people will listen and relax their guard. You could kill people. One of the people you hugged, you could have killed them. It‚Äôs bleak, but true. THINK. Wasn‚Äôt going to get involved with the Laurence Fox stuff, but now he‚Äôs bragging about putting my family at risk, I figure why not. I was once up against him for a US TV role ‚Äì to play the son of James Fox‚Äôs character. As in, Laurence‚Äôs actual dad. I got it.

There are many more in this vein. What they reveal, I fear, is that Britain is even more bitterly divided than ever it was during Brexit: between those who believe that Covid-19 is a deadly threat which could easily kill off their nearest and dearest and those, like Fox, who believe that it has been horribly overblown by government propaganda and that the time has come for us all to get on with our lives, reclaim our freedoms and get the economy back up and running.

The two positions are so intractably opposed that it‚Äôs hard to see how they can easily be resolved, especially when there‚Äôs so much righteous indignation on both sides.

But let‚Äôs take a step back for a moment. In what kind of sane universe would it be possible for a man to attract so much rage, so much bitter hatred merely for the crime of enjoying a lunch with friends.

Before 2020 it would have been literally inconceivable that anyone could consider the act of having lunch with friends anything but a healthy, happy, and perhaps above all, unexceptionable activity. It wouldn‚Äôt have been a problem at the height of either of the two World Wars. It wouldn‚Äôt even have been considered a problem during the Bubonic Plague.

I‚Äôd say all those angry hotheads bloviating against Laurence Fox need to look in the mirror and ask themselves: ‚ÄúWhat have I become?‚Äù

And Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration needs to look at itself too and ask: ‚ÄúWhat kind of monster have I created?‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

After that brief exchange, Cox‚Äôs friend and the stranger proceed to fight, according to Cox.

‚ÄúAll of the sudden, the guy is attacking my friend, and I look back ‚Äî and the guy is, like, hitting my friend, and then my friend is, like, going towards him, and I‚Äôm, like, ‚Äòholy shit,‚Äô and I pull out my phone, and I call 911 ‚Äî to dial 911, and all of the sudden it‚Äôs over,‚Äù said Cox. ‚ÄúAnd the guy is gone, and so I put my phone away, and then I‚Äôm like, what just happened?

‚ÄúWhat my friend thinks is that the guy really wanted me to answer so he could, like, you know, spook whether, like, you know, I‚Äôm trans or not,‚Äù said Cox. ‚ÄúDefinitely in shock, definitely triggered,‚Äù said Cox, who added that this type of incident has ‚Äúhappened a lot.‚Äù

And I just can‚Äôt believe that, like, it got physical. I guess I can believe it.‚Äù

The Charlie‚Äôs Angels actor hadn‚Äôt been leaving the house in general due to the coronavirus pandemic, and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna stay inside now, I‚Äôm really not going to go out now. Living in fear is, like, not a good thing. It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, you can be, like, Laverne Cox ‚Äî if you‚Äôre trans, you‚Äôre gonna experience stuff like this.‚Äù

Cox concluded the 10-minute video by stating that it‚Äôs important to remember ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your fault‚Äù if other people attack you because they don‚Äôt want you to ‚Äúexist in the world‚Äù due to being transgender.

‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs important for me to remind myself, and remind you that when these things happen, it‚Äôs not your fault,‚Äù said Cox. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault that there are people who are not cool with you existing in the world.‚Äù

Cox‚Äôs received support from many celebrities who commented on the video.

Actress Jamie Chung was among the celebrities who commented, writing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you and your friend were attacked. This is infuriating. I hope he was reported and you gave them his description.‚Äù

Cox did not specify whether or not 911 was called and if there was a police report filed.

After being alerted to the possible infringement of Britain‚Äôs nationwide lockdown measures, the London Metropolitan Police attempted to gain access to the venue at around 9pm on Saturday evening, but with no success.

However, officers continued their investigation into whether an event was taking place, and reportedly slapped Ora with a ¬£10,000 fine for her flouting of the lockdown rules. Ora has since acknowledged her mistake, describing it as a ‚Äúserious and inexcusable error of judgement.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello all, I attended a small gathering with some friends to celebrate my 30th birthday,‚Äù she posted on her Instagram story as reports began to hit the media. ‚ÄúIt was a spur of the moment decision made with the misguided view that we were coming out of lockdown and this would be OK. I‚Äôm deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúGiven the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility.‚Äù

A source close to Ora told the Mail: ‚ÄúRita knows her actions were wrong which is why she has voluntarily paid the ¬£10,000 ($13,367 USD) fine to the council. She hopes this will go some way to making up for her error of judgement.‚Äù

Ora‚Äôs ignoring of the rules follows countless reports of celebrities and public officials urging the public to abide by lockdown measures imposed as a response to the Chinese coronavirus before being caught violating the rules themselves.

Earlier this month, the cast and crew of the upcoming Matrix 4 film reportedly skirted Germany‚Äôs ban on parties and large social gatherings by throwing a party scene within the movie.

According to the newspaper Dild, the some 200 actors and production crew attending the bash at the Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Berlin, enjoyed everything from a DJ and pyrotechnics to tattoo stations and food caravans handing out sushi and fancy desserts.

In August, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo allowed musicians and celebrities to skirt the state‚Äôs mandatory 14-day quarantine rules so that they could perform at the MTV Video Music Awards.

‚ÄúI fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact,‚Äù Oliver Dowden told the Mail on Sunday.

‚ÄúWithout this, I fear a generation of viewers who did not live through these events may mistake fiction for fact.‚Äù

Dowden is expected to write to Netflix this week to express his view. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment, according to a report by The Associated Press.

The fourth series of the drama, which stars Olivia Colman as the Queen, has attracted criticism from some quarters for its depiction of royal events, in particular the breakdown of the marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales.

The Mail on Sunday has led calls for a disclaimer to be added to the series lest people think they are watching a documentary rather than an interpretative piece of fiction.

147,Report: NHS Will Use 'Sensible' Celebrities to Front Vaccines Campaign,['Jack Montgomery'],"Britain‚Äôs National Health Service (NHS) will launch a campaign fronted by ‚Äúvery sensible‚Äù celebrities to persuade people to take coronavirus vaccines, according to reports.

‚ÄúThere will be a big national campaign [to drive take-up],‚Äù a source told the Guardian.

‚ÄúNHS England are looking for famous faces, people who are known and loved. It could be celebrities who are very sensible and have done sensible stuff during the pandemic.‚Äù

The left-wing newspaper says Marcus Rashford, a professional football player who has been harrying the government over issues such as free school meals in recent months, is one of the names being considered.

100 million doses of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine have been ordered by Boris Johnson‚Äôs government, along with several million American-made vaccines

148,"Celebrity-Backed Time‚Äôs Up Spent Big on Executive Salaries, Little on Victims of Sexual Harassment",['David Ng'],"Time‚Äôs Up, the anti-sexual harassment organization created by Hollywood celebrities in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, has spent big bucks on executive salaries but has skimped on helping actual victims, according to a new report.

The group raised an impressive $3,670,219 during its founding year of 2018, but spent $1,407,032 on salaries and just $312,001 on the Time‚Äôs Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual harassment, the New York Post reported, citing tax filings.

In addition, the group reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on advertising, and $940,328 on ‚Äúlegal‚Äù costs, with the bulk of that figure going to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, the multinational law firm.

Time‚Äôs Up boasts a slew of Hollywood celebrities and former Obama associates in leadership roles. The group‚Äôs governing board includes former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, mega TV producer Shonda Rhimes, CNN personality Ana Navarro, as well as actresses Eva Longoria and Ashley Judd.

Tina Tchen, who served as an assistant to former President Obama and chief of staff for Michelle Obama, is currently Time‚Äôs Up president and chief executive officer. She is also co-founder of the Time‚Äôs Up Legal Defense Fund.

The Time‚Äôs Up Foundation‚Äôs ‚Äúglobal leadership board‚Äù includes a bevy of celebrities including Jessica Chastain, Brie Larson, Amy Schumer, Reese Witherspoon, Alyssa Milano, Julianne Moore, Mira Sorvino, and Padma Lakshmi. Oprah Winfrey serves as a ‚Äúvisionary ambassador‚Äù for the group.

The Post reported that Time‚Äôs Up spent $58,395 on travel and $112,435 on Rally, a public relations firm, during 2018. Charity watchdog groups recommend that non-profits spend 75 percent of their revenue on their mission and 25 percent on administration. Time‚Äôs Up spent 38 percent on salaries alone, according to the Post.

Last year, Time‚Äôs Up experienced a leadership shake-up after sexual harassment allegations were made against the son of then-president Lisa Borders. Tina Tchen succeeded Borders as the head of the group.

149,"David Prowse, British Weightlifter Who Played Darth Vader, Passes Away",['Breitbart London'],"LONDON (AP) ‚Äì Dave Prowse, the British weightlifter-turned-actor who played Darth Vader in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died. He was 85.

Prowse died Saturday after a short illness, his agent Thomas Bowington said Sunday.

Born in Bristol, southwest England, in 1935, Prowse represented England in weightlifting at the Commonwealth Games in the 1950s before breaking into movies with roles that emphasized his commanding size, including Frankenstein‚Äôs monster in a pair of horror films.

Director George Lucas saw Prowse in a small part in ‚ÄúA Clockwork Orange‚Äù and asked the 6-foot-6-inch (2-metre) actor to audition for the villainous Vader or the Wookie Chewbacca in Star Wars.

Prowse later told the BBC he chose Darth Vader because ‚Äúyou always remember the bad guys.‚Äù

Physically, Prowse was perfect for the part. His lilting English West Country accent was considered less ideal, and his lines were dubbed by James Earl Jones.

Prowse was also known to a generation of British children as the Green Cross Code Man, a superhero in a series of road safety advertisements

Ant-Man director Edgar Wright paid tribute to Prowse on Twitter.

‚ÄúAs a kid Dave Prowse couldn‚Äôt be more famous to me; stalking along corridors as evil incarnate in the part of Darth Vader & stopping a whole generation of kiddies from being mown down in street as the Green Cross Code man,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúRest in Peace, Bristol‚Äôs finest.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
150,Jon Voight Warns ‚ÄòWe Are in Great Danger if We Fall Under a Biden Administration‚Äô,['David Ng'],"Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight is warning that the United States will be ‚Äúin great danger‚Äù if Joe Biden becomes president, adding that the left is trying to steal the election with fraudulent votes.

The Midnight Cowboy star also slammed California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) for shutting down the state again. ‚ÄúGov. Newsom is taking away our freedom, your freedom. He‚Äôs a disgrace to mankind.‚Äù

Jon Voight made the comments in his most recent video that he posted to Twitter this week: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre heading down a street that has no name now. We must not allow our nation to crumble. This is what they want, to destroy America. Let me warn you all that we are in great danger if we fall under a Biden administration.‚Äù

Watch below:

Voight, who lives in California, then launched a broadside against Gov. Newsom.

‚ÄúOur state California is being ruled by a leftist mob ‚Äî himself, Gov. Newsom is taking away our freedom, your freedom. He‚Äôs a disgrace to mankind ‚Äî he and his relative Nancy Pelosi, who has tried to bring President Trump down,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúGov. Newsom has destroyed many lives of people who depended on their businesses and now he want to shut down again. He is a lie like all the left that are trying to destroy the USA.‚Äù

Voight continued: ‚ÄúI ask all to fight this battle now. To get them all out. I‚Äôve been attacked by my fellow peers, saying I am preaching violence. When the truth is they all are. The left are burning and destroing our cities. We are willing to fight for freedom. Not freedom to burn down our flag, but to raise her up, with the glory of this land of the free. But the left are trying to stop these truths.

‚ÄúLet us bring justice to the Supreme Court. Let them see how corrupt the left is with their fraudulent votes. Let the truth show itself, that President Trump is the only man that can save this nation. Let us fight this evil now and know that God‚Äôs truths will expose them all. Let me ask all to pray in the name of Jesus, Moses, and all saints for their hands of safety to be on us now. The way in which we‚Äôre being targeted will be hard to fix. But with all your love and prayers and truths, we can win this battle against this evil force that has taken over this country.‚Äù

Voight concluded: ‚ÄúWe must get Gov. Newsom out. He is destroying the people‚Äôs freedom. We must remember who we are. We are a nation that fought the Civil War and we won that battle. Let‚Äôs not give up. God bless.‚Äù

In his recent videos, Voight has called Joe Biden ‚Äúevil‚Äù and has expressed support for President Trump‚Äôs fight against Biden‚Äôs claim to victory in the presidential election.

151,Actor Faizon Love Sues Universal for Cutting Black Stars Out of ‚ÄòCouples Retreat‚Äô Publicity Posters,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Actor Faizon Love is suing Universal Studios for cutting him and his fellow black co-star Kali Hawk out of international publicity posters for the 2009 film, Couples Retreat.

The 52-year-old actor filed a lawsuit on Wednesday stating that he was ‚Äúaghast‚Äù when he saw himself and Hawk removed from publicity posters overseas, according to a report by The Hollywood Reporter.

‚ÄúUniversal Studios had no problem featuring Black actors in the comedic film. But when it came to publicizing the film to international audiences, Universal Studios chose to segregate the motion picture‚Äôs White and Black actors‚Ä¶‚Äù the lawsuit states. ‚ÄúRather than enjoy maximum visibility with the film‚Äôs release, Mr. Love was demoted to the proverbial ‚ÄòInvisible Man,‚Äô as penned by Ralph Ellison,‚Äù the complaint continued, referring to Ralph Ellison‚Äôs civil rights novel.

‚ÄúAlthough Couples Retreat achieved a first-place box office opening weekend ranking, and went on a spectacular run that grossed more than $171 million worldwide, Universal Studios placed Mr. Love in the back seat of the ride enjoyed by his six White costars,‚Äù the suit added.

Universal Studios had apologized when the doctored poster was first exposed, and according to Love, went on to promise him ‚Äúlucrative, career-making film roles‚Äù in the future, which he says have never materialized.

The lawsuit also accuses Universal of fraud, breach of contract, and violation of California‚Äôs fair employment act and civil rights law.

The suit goes on to accuse the film‚Äôs lead actor Vince Vaughn of telling Love ‚Äúthat making a big deal about his removal from the poster would not be good for his career.‚Äù

Love explained his reasoning for filing the lawsuit more than a decade after the film‚Äôs release in a tweet on Thursday.

‚ÄúPeople ask why now? One because Universal is still using the edited poster to promote the movie overseas, two no one said any thing when they went back ten years and ask [Kevin Hart] to explain his ‚Äòtweet‚Äô that kept him from hosting the Oscars‚Ä¶ not one person said why now‚Ä¶‚Äù wrote Love.

People ask why now? One because Universal is still using the edited poster to promote the movie overseas, two no one said any thing when they went back ten years and ask @KevinHart4real to explain his ‚Äùtweet‚Äù that kept him from hosting the Oscars‚Ä¶not one person said why now‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Faizon Love AKA Alvin Tostig (@FAIZONLOVE) November 26, 2020

The actor was referring to comedian and A-list actor Kevin Hart, who stepped down from hosting the 91st Academy Awards in 2018 amid a backlash over the resurfacing of previous gay jokes and tweets.

Love told Variety that he is seeking redress on behalf of black actors who have been mistreated by the industry.

‚ÄúThey have not only hurt me financially, they have hurt me in a deeper way by dismissing me because of my blackness ‚Äî and they have hurt all Black performers by continuing to perpetuate racism in the movie industry,‚Äù said Love. ‚ÄúI want to ensure that future generations don‚Äôt have to endure the racism and whitewashing that I have experienced.

152,"The Pandemic Is Changing Hollywood, Maybe Forever",['Breitbart News'],"NEW YORK (AP) ‚Äî ‚ÄúNo New ‚ÄòMovies‚Äô Till Influenza Ends‚Äù blared a New York Times headline on Oct. 10, 1918, while the deadly second wave of the Spanish Flu was unfolding.

A century later, during another pandemic, movies ‚Äî quotes no longer necessary ‚Äî are again facing a critical juncture. But it‚Äôs not because new films haven‚Äôt been coming out. By streaming service, video-on-demand, virtual theater or actual theater, a steady diet of films have been released under COVID-19 every week. The Times has reviewed more than 460 new movies since mid-March.

Watch below:

Yet until recently ‚Äî with only a few exceptions ‚Äî those haven‚Äôt been the big-budget spectacles Hollywood runs on. Eight months into the pandemic, that‚Äôs changing. Last month, the Walt Disney Co. experimented with the $200 million ‚ÄúMulan‚Äù as a premium buy on its fast-growing streaming service, Disney+ ‚Äî where the Pixar film ‚ÄúSoul‚Äù will also go on Dec. 25. WarnerMedia last week announced that ‚ÄúWonder Woman 1984‚Äù ‚Äî a movie that might have made $1 billion at the box office in a normal summer ‚Äî will land in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously next month.

Much remains uncertain about how the movie business will survive the pandemic. But it‚Äôs increasingly clear that Hollywood won‚Äôt be the same afterward. Just as the Spanish Flu, which weeded out smaller companies and contributed to the formation of the studio system, COVID-19 is remaking Hollywood, accelerating a digital makeover and potentially reordering an industry that was already in flux.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the genie will ever be back in the bottle,‚Äù says veteran producer Peter Guber, president of Mandalay Entertainment and former chief of Sony Pictures. ‚ÄúIt will be a new studio system. Instead of MGM and Fox, they‚Äôre going to be Disney and Disney+, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, HBO Max and Peacock.‚Äù

Many of the pivots in 2020 can be chalked up to the unusual circumstances. But several studios are making more long-term realignments around streaming. WarnerMedia, the AT&T conglomerate that owns Warner Bros. (founded in 1923), is now run by Jason Kilar, best known as the former chief executive of Hulu. Last month, Disney chief executive Bob Chapek, the Robert Iger heir, announced a reorganization to emphasize streaming and ‚Äúaccelerate our direct-to-consumer business.‚Äù

Universal Pictures, owned by Comcast, has pushed aggressively into video-on-demand. Its first major foray, ‚ÄúTrolls,‚Äù kicked up a feud with theater owners. But as the pandemic wore on, Universal hatched unprecedented deals with AMC and Cinemark, the largest and third-largest chains, respectively, to dramatically shorten the traditional theatrical window (usually about three months) to just 17 days. After that time, Universal can move releases that don‚Äôt reach certain box-office thresholds to digital rental.

While the nation‚Äôs second largest theater chain, Regal Cinemas, has resisted such deals, there‚Äôs widespread acknowledgement that the days of 90-day theatrical runs are over. It‚Äôs something the studios have long sought for the potential benefit of covering both platforms with one marketing campaign. Many see the pandemic as accelerating a decades-long trend.

‚ÄúWindows are clearly changing,‚Äù says Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount Pictures. ‚ÄúAll this stuff that‚Äôs going on now in the business was going to happen, the evolution is just happening faster than it would have. What would have taken three to five years is going to be done in a year, maybe a year and a half.‚Äù

That condensed period of rapid change is happening at the same time as a land rush for streaming market share, as Disney+, HBO Max, Apple and Peacock wrestle for a piece of the home viewing audience dominated by Netflix and Amazon. With theme parks struggling and worldwide box office down tens of billions, streaming is a bright spot for media companies, and the pandemic may offer a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to lure subscribers. ‚ÄúWonder Woman 1984‚Äù and ‚ÄúSoul‚Äù are essentially very expensive advertisements for those streaming services.

Watch below:

Each studio, depending on their corporate ownership and streaming positioning, is taking a different approach. Paramount, like Sony Pictures, doesn‚Äôt have a streaming service to offload films to. Both have held back their tentpole releases while selling more midsized films to streamers. For Paramount, ‚ÄúA Quiet Place: Part II,‚Äù ‚ÄúTop Gun Maverick‚Äù and ‚ÄúMission: Impossible 7‚Äù are waiting for 2021 while ‚ÄúThe Trial of the Chicago 7‚Äù fetched a reported $56 million from Netflix and Eddie Murphy‚Äôs ‚ÄúComing to America 2‚Äù went to Amazon Prime Video for a reported $125 million.

HBO Max has had a bumpier rollout than Disney+, so ‚ÄúWonder Woman 1984‚Äù is an especially critical gambit for WarnerMedia following the audacious release of ‚ÄúTenet.‚Äù As the first tentpole to test theaters reopened with safety protocols and reduced capacities, it has made about $350 million worldwide ‚Äî a lot considering everything but far less than originally hoped for. Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson called the ‚ÄúWonder Woman‚Äù plans ‚Äî which include rolling theatrical runs in China, Europe and elsewhere ‚Äî ‚Äúa grand experiment that could have-lasting implications if successful.‚Äù

Director Patty Jenkins acknowledged the simultaneous release was a kind of sacrifice, not just to HBO Max but to families stuck at home. ‚ÄúAt some point you have to choose to share any love and joy you have to give, over everything else,‚Äù Jenkins wrote on Twitter.

It can be easy to cheer such moves, even if their financial performance remain cloudy (no studio has been transparent about its viewership numbers or digital grosses) and their long-term viability uncertain. Can you replicate $1 billion in box office in new subscriptions? And for how long will the one-time bounce of a new movie (unlike a series staggered over weeks or months) drive subscribers once streaming services are closer to tapping as many homes as they can?

‚ÄúThe whole thing is more complicated than people want it to be,‚Äù says Ira Deutchman, the veteran independent film producer and Columbia University professor. ‚ÄúThe way movies are made and distributed, certainly at the studio level, has been really in need of change and hopefully this will bring it on. But when people hear that, it‚Äôs like: The pandemic is the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back and now theatrical is dead. I personally feel that‚Äôs garbage.‚Äù

Deutchman considers the idea that people, after a year of quarantines and lockdowns, won‚Äôt want to leave their living room ‚Äúludicrous.‚Äù But he does imagine continued mergers and acquisitions, and ‚Äúa new equilibrium‚Äù for distributors and theater owners.

So what could that mean on the other side of COVID, if moviegoers are once again comfortable sitting in packed theaters on opening weekend? It will almost certainly mean the months-long runs of films like ‚ÄúTitanic‚Äù or ‚ÄúGet Out‚Äù are a thing of the past. It could mean variable pricing on different nights. It could mean an even greater division between the franchise films of the multiplex and the boutique art house, with everything in between going straight to streaming.

But after decades of slow but steady decline in attendance, most think movie theaters will have to innovate in a way other than raising ticket prices.

‚ÄúThe outlook is pretty dire in terms of being a major theatrical exhibitor,‚Äù says Jeff Bock, senior box-office analyst for Exhibitor Relations. He imagines shortened windows will mean few films ‚Äî even the Marvel releases ‚Äî ascending to $1 billion in worldwide box office. He can see some studios, like Disney, operating their own theaters as ‚Äúmini-theme parks‚Äù with merchandising stuffing the lobbies.

In the meantime, theaters are hoping for much-needed relief from Congress. With the virus surging, about 40% of U.S. theaters are open; in New York and Los Angeles, they‚Äôve stayed shut since March. Chains have taken on loans to stay afloat and avert bankruptcy. Cineworld, owner of Regal Cinemas (currently entirely closed) on Monday announced a deal for a $450 million rescue loan.

It will be a very different holiday season ‚Äî usually the most lucrative corridor in theaters ‚Äî for the movie business. How different 2021 and beyond will be remains to be seen. Some things, though, may never change.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre going to be in this business, no matter what you do or where it plays, whether it‚Äôs streaming or in cinemas, you‚Äôre going to make hits and you‚Äôre going to make flops,‚Äù says Guber. ‚ÄúThe idea is to make more hits than flops.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
153,Music Legends Van Morrison and Eric Clapton Team for Anti-Lockdown Anthem ‚ÄòStand and Deliver‚Äô,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Rock music legends Van Morrison and Eric Clapton have teamed up for ‚ÄúStand and Deliver,‚Äù a song that takes coronavirus lockdowns to task.

‚ÄúThere are many of us who support Van and his endeavors to save live music; he is an inspiration,‚Äù Clapton said according to Variety. ‚ÄúWe must stand up and be counted because we need to find a way out of this mess. The alternative is not worth thinking about. Live music might never recover.‚Äù

Clapton also said that the end of live entertainment due to coronavirus lockdowns is ‚Äúdeeply upsetting.‚Äù

Proceeds for the track ‚Äî set to be released on December 4 ‚Äî will go to Morrison‚Äôs Lockdown Financial Hardship Fund, which works to lend financial assistance to musicians left struggling during the global pandemic and the mitigation lockdowns imposed across the world.

‚ÄúIt is heartbreaking to see so many talented musicians lack any meaningful support from the government, but we want to reassure them that we are working hard every day to lobby for the return of live music, and to save our industry,‚Äù Morrison added upon release of news of his Clapton collaboration.

According to his website, Morrison‚Äôs fund has already disbursed its first allotments. Still, the group promises that more money will soon be raised for a second round of donations to struggling artists.

Van Morrison has already released several songs that are critical of the lockdowns, including ‚ÄúBorn To Be Free,‚Äù ‚ÄúAs I Walked Out,‚Äù and ‚ÄúNo More Lockdown.‚Äù

Morrison‚Äôs criticism of lockdowns has stirred controversy in certain circles, especially among government officials. The ‚ÄúMoondance‚Äù singer recently drew criticism from Northern Ireland‚Äôs health minister Robin Swann who called the protest songs ‚Äúdangerous.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where he gets his facts. I know where the emotions are on this,‚Äù Swann told BBC in September, ‚Äúbut I will say that sort of messaging is dangerous.‚Äù As Rolling Stone reported, Morrison has for decades voiced grievances through song, but ‚Äúthis time, Morrison‚Äôs preferred method of venting might also cause harm to others.‚Äù

The Hollywood star said that these ‚Äúsuper spreader‚Äù events will eventually become a burden on health-care workers.

On Monday, Midler tweeted her disbelief that the high court is allowing people to gather in houses of worship.

‚ÄúPacking the Supreme Court really works, but for whom? Why do the religious get to gather in super spreader groups, if they will sicken rest of us?‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúAnd when they get sick why should any stressed out health-care worker be forced to look after them? Doctors and nurses should sue.‚Äù

The Hocus Pocus star made no mention of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and riots that have taken place in cities across the country, bringing together thousands of protestors in close proximity during the coronavirus pandemic.

Packing the Supreme Court really works, but for whom? Why do the religious get to gather in super spreader groups, if they will sicken rest of us? And when they get sick why should any stressed out health-care worker be forced to look after them? Doctors and nurses should sue. ‚Äî bettemidler (@BetteMidler) November 27, 2020

Midler also expressed her support for virtual religious services where worshippers practice their faith remotely.

As Breitbart News reported, the Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling represents a major victory for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in their fight against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo‚Äôs (D) restrictions, which limited house of worship attendance to 10 to 25 people. The plaintiffs argued that the limits violated religious freedom under the First Amendment.

Newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the majority in the case, while Chief Justice John Roberts sided with liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Bette Midler vocally opposed President Donald Trump‚Äôs Constitutional right to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg‚Äôs Supreme Court seat. She attacked Coney Barrett for her religious affiliations while calling her ‚Äúthe ultimate product‚Äù of the Koch brothers, the Heritage Foundation, and other conservative groups.

#AmyConeyBarret, on Board of a school that won‚Äôt allow in a student with a gay parent, has been groomed for decades, the ultimate product of #theKochs, #TheFederalists, #TheHeritageFoundation.

155,"Former Aide Mocks Andrew Cuomo for Victory Book, ‚ÄòDepressing' Emmy Win",['Joshua Caplan'],"Alexis Grenell, a former aide to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D), has slammed her former boss over his conduct during the coronavirus pandemic in a searing op-ed published Thursday in The Nation.

‚ÄúThe Andrew Cuomo New Yorkers know and mostly tolerate, the snarling attack dog who gaslights fellow Democrats and deploys staff to call his female critics ‚Äòf‚Äî-g idiots,‚Äô dropped down to Earth last week. It was a hard landing after a long-distance love affair with a fanbase in a galaxy far, far away,‚Äù said Grenell, who served as Cuomo‚Äôs deputy director of intergovernmental affairs during his time as New York‚Äôs attorney general.

Grenell took aim at Cuomo for penning a victory-lap book ‚Äî American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the COVID-19 Pandemic ‚Äî touting his handling of the pandemic, which has yet to conclude.

‚ÄúIt all boils down to this: Any dissent is a partisan attack on our very lives, and Andrew Cuomo is our only hope,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúTo solidify the narrative, he‚Äôs even written a self-congratulatory book at what he calls ‚Äòhalf-time‚Äò in the crisis. Kind of like how every coach puts out a press release mid-game and Winston Churchill wrote the history of World War II in 1943. Oh, wait‚Ä¶‚Äù

Grenell then mocked Cuomo for accepting an International Emmy award for his televised briefings on the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe whole thing was already very Through the Looking Glass before the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced on Friday that they were awarding the governor an Emmy for his ‚Äútelevision shows with characters, plot lines, and stories of success and failure,‚Äù the former aide wrote.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs something genuinely depressing about seeing the son of a man who refused a seat on the Supreme Court so eager to be flattered by Ben Stiller,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost hard to remember how he ridiculed two-time Emmy Award‚Äìwinner Cynthia Nixon back in 2018 for being an unqualified celebrity.‚Äù

Cuomo and his office have not yet responded to Grenell‚Äôs essay.

Grenell‚Äôs sharp criticism came as the U.S. Supreme Court dealt a hard blow to Cuomo‚Äôs restrictions on religious services.

As Breitbart News reported:

On Wednesday evening, the high court ruled in favor 5-4 with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in their lawsuit alleging Cuomo‚Äôs gathering restrictions, which limited house of worship attendance from 10 to 25 people, violated religious freedom under the First Amendment.

Cuomo bitterly dismissed the Court‚Äôs ruling, calling the decision ‚Äúirrelevant.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
156,Hollywood Storms Georgia: Kevin Bacon Hosting Celebrity Fundraiser for Pro-Democrat Group,['David Ng'],"Georgia is ground zero in the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C., as control of the U.S. Senate now hinges on the outcome of the two Senate runoff races in the Peach State. With the Senate majority leadership within his reach, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, ‚ÄúNow we take Georgia, and then we change America.‚Äù Now Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are reportedly the latest Hollywood celebrities to lend their star power to Democrats in Georgia, hoping to boost the chances of candidates Raphael Warrnock and Jon Ossoff and turn the Senate blue.

The acting power couple will join comedian Billy Eichner and Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. in a fundraiser for Swing Left, one of many progressive organizations that is mobilizing Democratic turnout in Georgia, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Maze Runner producer Ellen Goldsmith-Vein will co-host the December 3 event.

Swing Left is among the many progressive groups that have set their sights on Georgia ahead of the state‚Äôs January 5 runoffs. The organization, which was founded in the wake of President Trump‚Äôs 2016 victory, has specialized in recruiting celebrities to push its agenda, including Broadway and Homeland star Mandy Patinkin.

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick teamed up with Swing Left in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, participating in podcasts and donating money to the group.

Hollywood celebrities have made Georgia their top political priority in their effort to push Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock across the finish line. A-list stars including George Clooney and Will Smith have poured money into the races, while actors Kumail Nanjiani and Sophia Bush are spearheading WinBothSeats, an initiative to get out the minority vote for Democrats.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is holding a Veep reunion next month to raise money for America Votes, the left-wing group that is working to boost Democratic chances in Georgia‚Äôs runoffs. Other stars pushing Georgia Democrats on social media include Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing.

157,"Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Bon Jovi Pose for Coronavirus Billboards in New Jersey: ‚ÄòWear a Friggin‚Äô Mask!‚Äô",['David Ng'],"Drivers in New Jersey are receiving a mandatory lecture on the coronavirus thanks to a new series of billboards demanding that everyone wears a mask. The effort comes courtesy of three famous sons of the Garden State ‚Äî Jon Stewart, Bruce Springsteen, and Jon Bon Jovi.

The billboards come as New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) is facing widespread criticism after he and his family were caught dining out without masks after he imposed further statewide restrictions on social gatherings.

New Jersey officials unveiled the billboards this week along highways throughout the state. ‚ÄúWear a friggin‚Äô mask!‚Äù the billboards say. The three celebrities teamed up on the initiative with the New Jersey Department of Health and the New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund.

First lady Tammy Murphy tweeted that ‚Äúas we enter the holiday season, it‚Äôs important to stay vigilant about #COVID19.‚Äù She also used the hashtag #MaskUpNJ.

Gov. Murphy (D) has come under fire after a video showed his family dining out without wearing masks. The family was accosted by passersby who hurled obscenities at them. The governor recently imposed further social restrictions on residents, ordering people to limit indoor gatherings to ten individual and outdoor gatherings to 150.

He also told New Jerseyites to keep their Thanksgiving gatherings ‚Äúas small as possible.‚Äù

As we enter the holiday season, it‚Äôs important to stay vigilant about #COVID19. @JonBonJovi, @Springsteen, and Jon Stewart teamed up with @NJ_PRF and @NJDeptofHealth to remind you to wear a friggin‚Äô mask! #MaskUpNJ pic.twitter.com/dLbSSIBr6o ‚Äî Tammy Murphy (@FirstLadyNJ) November 25, 2020

Bruce Springsteen also promoted the billboards on social media. The Freehold, N.J.-native wrote: ‚ÄúTeamed up with some fellow New Jerseyans to encourage everyone this holiday season to wear a friggin‚Äô mask. Let‚Äôs all come together and #MaskUpNJ so we can get back to what we do best ‚Äì singing along and dancing together.‚Äù

Springsteen recently promised to flee the United States and move to Australia if President Donald Trump wins a second term.

New Jersey has the highest COVID-19 death rate in the country. Early in the pandemic, Gov. Murphy ordered the state‚Äôs nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, which is believed to have helped the virus spread rapidly among the elderly population.

158,Rihanna Sends Support to ‚ÄòMourning‚Äô Native Americans On Thanksgiving,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Pop star Rihanna, whom Forbes recently named among the richest self-made women in America, with a net worth of $600 million, celebrated Thanksgiving by showing her support for Native Americans who are ‚Äúmourning‚Äù during the holiday.

The Diamonds singer posted a message to her Instagram Story reading, ‚ÄúSome are celebrating today‚Ä¶ many are mourning! Sending love to all my Native American brothers and sisters.‚Äù

The ocean‚Äôs 8 actress often spews political rants on her social media. A few months ago, Rihanna went on the attack against Kentucky officials over the Breonna Taylor grand jury decision. And last year, the Grammy-winner loudly rejected an offer to perform at the Super Bowl because the league had still not given national anthem protester Colin Kaepernick a job.

Rihanna was not the only pop singer to attack the Thanksgiving tradition.

Singer Demi Lovato also jumped to Instagram to undermine the Thanksgiving holiday with a series of images she took from a left-wing activist group named Showing Up For Racial Justice that made to ‚Äúdebunk‚Äù many of the facts people believe about the first Thanksgiving.

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato)

The memes the 28-year-old HEAL singer posted were entitled ‚ÄúDecolonizing Thanksgiving.‚Äù

Lovato‚Äôs posts included one that debunked the claim that the first Thanksgiving occurred in 1621. ‚ÄúFact,‚Äù Lovato‚Äôs meme read, ‚ÄúNo one really knows when the ‚Äòfirst‚Äô Thanksgiving occurred.‚Äù

The meme posts continued with another that relayed the claim from the Wampanoag tribe‚Äôs ‚Äúoral traditions‚Äù that claim that the pilgrims did not celebrate the day by inviting the Indians to a feast, and no invitation was ever offered to the local tribes, they claim.

Lovato‚Äôs memes also insist that it is a ‚Äúmyth‚Äù that the Pilgrims and the Indians became friends and insisted that English soldiers ‚Äúmassacred roughly 700 Pequot men, women, and children at Mystic Fort, burning many of them alive in their homes and killing those who fled.‚Äù

But as Breitbart News editor-at-large Rebecca Mansour notes in a lengthy piece, the American left‚Äôs ‚Äú‚Äònarrative of Thanksgiving‚Äô is historically inaccurate garbage. We know who the Pilgrims are and what they did because they meticulously documented everything for posterity.‚Äù

159,Terrorist Friend of Ariana Grande Concert Bomber Getting Out of Prison,['Victoria Friedman'],"Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was friends with Salman Abedi and was communicating with him in the months leading up to the Manchester Arena terror attack, is due to be released from prison this week.

The inquiry into the Manchester bombing has heard in recent months the details of the two terrorists‚Äô close relationship. Abedi had been friends with Abdallah since 2014, and they had ‚Äúconversed about martyrdom‚Äù between July and November of that year. When Abdallah was on bail, Abedi took him to mosques.

The Manchester bomber then visited Abdallah in prison in 2015 and then again two years later, maintaining contact with the convicted terrorist in the intervening years. He called Abdallah regularly in the months leading up to the terror attack, notably on the same day that he received a delivery of chemicals for his suicide pack. Despite requests from lawyers, Abdallah, 27, has refused to cooperate with authorities conducting the inquiry.

Sources confirmed to Sky News on Thursday that Abdallah is due for release on licence ‚Äî similar to parole ‚Äî this week, after having been jailed in 2016 following a conviction for trying to help his brother and two other Islamists to travel to Syria to join Islamic State.

Some of the relatives of the victims have expressed their shock at Abdallah‚Äôs forthcoming release. The lawyer of 12 of them told The Times that it was ‚Äúbeyond belief‚Äù he was being released given his refusal to cooperate with the Manchester bombing inquiry, as he could shed light on many aspects of the investigation.

Lawyer Victoria Higgins of Slater & Gordon said: ‚ÄúThe contact this man had with Salman Abedi in the weeks and months before the Arena bomb is something that the inquiry will be exploring in great detail.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is truly devastating news at what has already been a hugely distressing experience for the families sitting through this inquiry,‚Äù Ms Higgins added.

""Irrespective of his supposedly strict licensing conditions, releasing Abdallah ‚Äî a man who has close links to the Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi ‚Äî poses a clear threat to British public safety."" My quote in @Telegraph.https://t.co/arbSHY2HtJ ‚Äî Dr Rakib Ehsan (@rakibehsan) November 27, 2020

Abdallah has fully completed the custodial portion of his short sentence. He may be recalled to prison if he breaches the terms of his licence, although such conditions have failed to stop early-release terrorists before.

Abdallah was born in Libya and grew up in the same part of Manchester as the Abedi brothers. In 2010, he travelled to Tripoli to fight and was shot and seriously injured in 2011. The NHS treated him for his injuries, giving what was described as life-saving treatment, after his parents had flown him back to Britain. The jihadist was paralysed from the waist down and is wheelchair-bound.

The terrorist will be subject to a tag on his release and be restricted on his access to electronic devices such as computers. He will be banned from interacting with certain people and will be prohibited from entering Manchester city centre. Additionally, he will be ordered to attend a deradicalisation programme.

The effectiveness of deradicalisation programmes has come under scrutiny in the past 12 months, following the London Bridge terror attack committed in November 2019 by Usman Khan, who was attending a rehabilitation event when he launched his stabbing spree, killing two of the course‚Äôs facilitators. Khan was considered a ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù of an Islamist who turned his life around. King‚Äôs College London published a paper in July revealing that terrorists are pretending to be reformed in order to secure early release.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously admitted that ‚Äúreally very few‚Äù Islamists are successfully reformed.

Security Guard Ignored Ariana Grande Concert Bomber ‚ÄòFor Fear of Being Branded a Racist‚Äô https://t.co/eiSKbSGbzm ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2020

Terrorism expert Dr Rakib Ehsan of the Henry Jackson Society warned that Abdallah still represents a risk to national security and should be detained in prison for the full nine-and-a-half years of his sentence.

Dr Ehsan told The Telegraph: ‚ÄúIrrespective of his supposedly strict licensing conditions, releasing Abdallah ‚Äî a man who has close links to the Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi ‚Äî poses a clear threat to British public safety.

‚ÄúGiven he was released automatically, without a parole hearing, we simply have no idea if he has been ‚Äòderadicalised‚Äô or remains a hardened fundamentalist. All this tells a story of a fundamentally flawed system for dealing with Islamist terrorists.‚Äù

The inquiry into the May 2017 terror attack revealed that Britain‚Äôs domestic security agency MI5 was aware that Abedi was in contact with Abdallah before the attack, but did not reopen their investigation into Abedi.

160,Trump Jr. Warns Georgians: 'My Father‚Äôs Accomplishments Are on Your Ballot',['Hannah Bleau'],"Donald Trump Jr. is warning Georgians that President Donald Trump‚Äôs accomplishments are on the ballot in the January 5th runoffs, as the results will determine the balance of power in the U.S. Senate, which has helped enact the president‚Äôs MAGA agenda.

The president‚Äôs eldest son, who has urged Republicans in Georgia to support Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue against their radical left opponents, is featured in a six-figure radio ad which dropped in the Peach State on Tuesday. In the ad, Trump Jr. explains that his father‚Äôs accomplishments remain on the ballot.

The ad begins with a soundbite of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) celebrating in the streets after the media declared former Vice President Joe Biden the victor of the 2020 presidential election.

‚ÄúNow we take Georgia, and then we change the world!‚Äù a maskless Schumer exclaimed at the time.

‚ÄúThe radical left wants to tear down everything we‚Äôve accomplished,‚Äù Trump Jr. begins in the Save the U.S. Senate PAC ad.

‚ÄúDefunding the police, destroying private health insurance, and dismantling the Supreme Court. They‚Äôll take away our Second Amendment rights and make it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves in their own homes,‚Äù he continued.

‚ÄúOn January 5th, the U.S. Senate is on the line, and my father‚Äôs accomplishments are on your ballot,‚Äù he stressed, adding, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let Chuck Schumer and the radical left succeed. On January 5th, vote Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue for Senate.‚Äù

According to Axios, the ad will air statewide on both conservative talk radio and country music stations.

Trump Jr. has remained outspoken in the weeks leading to the Georgia runoffs, addressing the rumors of ‚Äúpeople that are supposed to be on our side‚Äù urging Republicans not to vote for the GOP incumbents.

‚ÄúThat is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people,‚Äù the president‚Äôs eldest son said, laying into those encouraging Republicans to sit on the sidelines in the January 5th runoffs. ‚ÄúWe need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David‚Äù:

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of talk from people that are supposed to be on our side telling GOP voters not to go out & vote for @KLoeffler and @PerdueSenate. That is NONSENSE. IGNORE those people. We need ALL of our people coming out to vote for Kelly & David.#MAGA #GASEN ‚Äî Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) November 23, 2020

His November 23 plea followed chatter from other conservative voices, who have publicly suggested that they will not support the GOP senators in next month‚Äôs runoffs.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs speak truth about @SenLoeffler & @sendavidperdue. Why are they doing little or nothing to support efforts by GA citizens to address unlawful election & need for @BrianKempGA to order special session of legislature?‚Äù attorney Lin Wood asked.

‚ÄúIf not fixed, I will NOT vote in GA runoff. Will you?‚Äù Wood inquired:

Let‚Äôs speak truth about @SenLoeffler & @sendavidperdue. Why are they doing little or nothing to support efforts by GA citizens to address unlawful election & need for @BrianKempGA to order special session of legislature? If not fixed, I will NOT vote in GA runoff. Will you? ‚Äî Lin Wood (@LLinWood) November 21, 2020

Loeffler‚Äôs and Perdue‚Äôs victories are crucial for the GOP to maintain its Senate majority. The bigger picture, as Trump Jr. alluded to in the ad, is maintaining a majority to uphold the vast accomplishments Trump‚Äôs achieved over the course of the last four years.

If Democrats were to snag these two seats, it would split the Senate 50-50, giving the tiebreaker to the team controlling the White House. If Trump is successful in his various legal challenges, Vice President Mike Pence would serve as the tiebreaker. However, in a Biden White House, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), who was once rated the most leftist senator in the upper chamber, would determine the direction of the Senate.

The Democrat senate candidates, Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, both have histories of radical positions. A recently emerged video shows Warnock mocking the prospect of churchgoers for arming themselves:

BOMBSHELL: Newly found video shows Georgia Senate candidate @ReverendWarnock LAUGHING at church-goers who defend themselves with guns. First Warnock goes after our veterans, now our Second Amendment. Georgians have a clear choice Jan. 5! #gapol #gasen pic.twitter.com/YFtGdiqkOi ‚Äî NRA (@NRA) November 30, 2020

On Sunday, Perdue‚Äôs challenger, Jon Ossoff, confessed that he would support a statewide lockdown of businesses to fight the Chinese coronavirus, adding that ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to trust the experts‚Äù:

161,Watch: Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey Appears to Decline Call from President Trump,['Kyle Olson'],"Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey appeared to decline a call from President Donald Trump on Monday as he was signing an election certification document.

The ring tone, ‚ÄúHail to the Chief,‚Äù could be heard as Ducey took the phone out of his jacket pocket. He appeared to look at the screen, decline the call, and place the phone screen-down on the table.

MSNBC noted Ducey previously said he changed Trump‚Äôs ring tone to the presidential song so he could more easily recognize his calls.

‚ÄúI had to change the ring tone on my phone and it rings ‚ÄòHail to the Chief‚Äô because I didn‚Äôt want to miss another phone call directly from the White House,‚Äù Ducey said in early July.

As Ducey was signing the document effectively awarding Arizona‚Äôs 11 electoral votes to Joe Biden, legislators were taking testimony from Trump‚Äôs lawyer, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, and witnesses to alleged voter fraud in the state.

Trump called into the hearing and blasted Ducey, accusing him of rushing the certification process, Breitbart News reported.

‚ÄúOn top of it, you have a governor named Ducey,‚Äù the president said as the crowd booed. ‚ÄúHe just rushed to sign certificates ‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs that all about? He didn‚Äôt have to sign it.

‚ÄúWe recognize the violent nature of the revolutionary Iranian regime, and we understand that when it comes to countering Tehran and many other important issues, Israel is a key partner, and not a problem,‚Äù Pompeo said at the virtual opening of the first U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue.

His remarks come in the wake of the assassination of the Islamic Republic‚Äôs nuclear weapons mastermind Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on Friday, which Tehran alleged Israel was behind.

Pompeo called Iran ‚Äúthe number one threat to the Gulf‚Äôs security and to peace-loving people throughout the entire region.‚Äù Apparent president-elect Joe Biden has said he would revert to the Obama-led 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, from which President Donald Trump pulled out in May 2018. The deal would have seen Iran acquire the nuclear bomb by 2030. Biden has said he would seek changes to the so-called sunset clause.

According to leaked diplomatic cables, Germany, France and Britain urged the Trump administration in October to reconsider his maximum pressure campaign against Iran, in particular his sanctions on the Islamic Republic‚Äôs banks, arguing that the move would damage legitimate humanitarian trade, the Reuters news wire reported Tuesday.

Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani, who also attended the U.S.-Bahrain Strategic Dialogue, called on the U.S. to continue exerting maximum pressure on Iran.

It is ‚Äúessential that the international community maintains its resolve to recognize and confront such behavior, with unrelenting pressure on Iran to become a responsible actor,‚Äù Zayani said in his opening remarks.

President Trump gave his first post-election interview to Maria Bartiromo on her Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures. During the phone interview, the president attacked the mainstream media for its refusal to run negative stories about Joe Biden, calling it ‚Äúsuppression by the press.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression by the press. They suppress,‚Äù the president said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a scandal if nobody reports about it. This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint.‚Äù

Jimmy Kimmel used the Fox News interview to mock Bartiromo, calling her ‚Äúalways sycophantic‚Äù when it comes to the president.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what happened to her, but she appears to be auditioning for the position of Donald Trump‚Äôs next wife because that was some interview,‚Äù he said.

164,Watch Live: Michigan Senate Committee Holds Hearing on Absentee Ballot Counting,['Kyle Olson'],"The Michigan Senate Oversight Committee is holding a hearing on Tuesday regarding absentee ballot counting during the presidential election in Detroit.

The committee, chaired by state Sen. Ed McBroom, will take testimony related to ‚Äúabsentee ballot counting at the TCF Center,‚Äù according to the committee‚Äôs website.

Controversy erupted over the weekend when the committee refused to include President Trump‚Äôs attorney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.

Over 100 observers of the ballot counting process in Detroit have filed affidavits testifying to what they witnessed, which included allegations of ballots being counted multiple times, procedures not being followed, observers being blocked from being able to watch the process, and mysterious vehicles showing up in the middle of the night to deliver additional ballots.

The Wayne County Board of Canvassers initially declined to certify the results from the jurisdiction that includes Detroit, before the two Republican members reversed their votes after hours of withering personal attacks by Joe Biden supporters and Democrat activists.

They then attempted to reverse the reversal, but were unsuccessful. The State Board of Canvassers certified Michigan‚Äôs results 3-0, with one Republican abstaining from the vote.

Sources tell Breitbart News that the hearings are intended to collect information that may influence potential reforms for future elections.

House Oversight Committee chairman Matt Hall announced on Tuesday that Giuliani will now be appearing in person on Wednesday.

Elise Stefanik (R-NY) laid out a dynamic in the House of Representatives as the White House, and the Senate Republicans worked to hammer out an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on a COVID-19 relief package.

According to Stefanik, Pelosi‚Äôs grip on the control of the House was slipping as more so-called progressive Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), were on the rise.

‚ÄúI think Mitch is exactly right. Speaker Pelosi has walked away again and again and again from negotiations,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere are a number of provisions that we agree on.

‚ÄúShe lost every single toss-up seat in the country,‚Äù Stefanik continued. ‚ÄúRepublicans have picked up numerous seats, and we‚Äôre continuing to pick them with an Iowa House seat and a California House seat.

167,Boris Johnson to Repeal Election-Busting Law That Almost Killed Brexit,['Oliver Jj Lane'],"A David Cameron-era law that left Britain‚Äôs government paralysed and Brexit at the mercy of what transpired to be an unrepresentative Parliament is being repealed, returning a small part of the UK constitution to the long-term historical norm.

The Fixed-Term Parliaments Act is set to be repealed by Boris Johnson‚Äôs Conservative government just nine years after it was voted into power by another Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron. The law, which changed the way general elections were called from being events that could either be voluntary by the government or forced on them by events, to being fixed on a permanent five-year cycle, was passed during the 2010 coalition government to appease the junior governing partner, Nick Clegg‚Äôs Liberal Democrats.

While the concept of fixed-term parliaments was part of a raft of major changes to Britain‚Äôs unwritten, and generally quite longstanding and time-tested, constitution wanted by the Liberal Democrats ‚Äî including a total change to the nation‚Äôs election system to benefit smaller challenger parties like themselves ‚Äî the introduction of the law had very specific consequences in the life of the last parliament, as members weaponised the job security it gave them to delay and sabotage the Brexit process for six painful months.

British broadsheet The Times reports the remarks of a Tory insider who said of the decision to push ahead with scrapping the act: ‚ÄúThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act caused constitutional chaos last year which, when combined with gridlock in parliament, meant the previous government couldn‚Äôt deliver what it was asked to do. Ultimately, at critical moments, we trust the public to decide. So we are going back to the system that lets elections happen when they are needed.‚Äù

Would Turkeys Vote For Christmas? Why MPs Will Resist Boris Johnson‚Äôs Snap Election https://t.co/yaWidxRhwh ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 4, 2019

Through the leadership of Theresa May and Boris Johnson, the government was repeatedly defeated on Brexit votes, events under the old system that would have seen the government collapse and a new general election called. But because the law prevented that from happening, anti-Brexit rebels on both sides of the house were able to constantly throw roadblocks in the way of the Brexit process but not face the judgement of the voters.

In an effort to block the deadlock, Boris Johnson attempted to call a general election three times, but was prevented by doing so by rebel MPs invoking the act on every occasion. Even though it was becoming increasingly clear the country supported Brexit being done, a legacy parliament that did not represent that attitude clung on to power beyond its natural life through the act.

Eventually, the government was able to pass a simple law overriding the act to sign into existence a one-off election, which the Conservatives ‚Äî campaigning heavily on a platform of making Brexit happen ‚Äî won in a major landslide, even taking northern left-wing seats that hadn‚Äôt voted Conservative in generations. The haughty attitude of Labour‚Äôs London-based ‚Äòmetropolitan elite‚Äô leaders towards Brexit was widely blamed for this defeat.

Another promise made by the Conservatives in that election was to repeal the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, to prevent a so-called ‚Äòzombie parliament‚Äô holding the country to ransom again, both by preventing the government from governing while at the same time preventing a new government from being elected. As Breitbart London reported in December when the government started to move forwards with abolishing the act, Vernon Bogdanor, Professor of Government at King‚Äôs College London outlined some of the issued with the act that would be dismissed with its repeal.

Professor Bogdanor said the 2011 law was ‚Äúfull of holes‚Äù and, perhaps being charitable, remarked that when it was written the authors may have not foreseen the situation which came to pass where ‚Äúthe government had lost control of the Commons, Her Majesty‚Äôs Opposition would, for tactical reasons, refuse an election‚Äù.

The ability of the government to collapse is, the professor said, in fact a ‚Äúvital safeguard against inter-party manoeuvrings and shenanigans‚Äù.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
168,Boris Faces Massive Tory Rebellion over Coronavirus Restrictions,['Victoria Friedman'],"Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion of up to 100 Conservative MPs planning to vote against putting 99 per cent of England under the top two strictest coronavirus measures.

The prime minister‚Äôs proposals from last week revealed that despite England being under a month-long lockdown during November, more of the country will find itself in a higher tier coming out of shutdown than going in, with just Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in Tier 1.

Conservative MPs were outraged by the recommended demarcations, calling the measures ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù, with others saying that the ‚Äúwheels are coming off the government‚Äôs arguments‚Äù to continue imposing them.

14.6 million more people in England are now in Tier 3 compared to pre-lockdown, when cases were also falling. Meanwhile, non-Covid deaths at home are rising way above the 5 year average as many are too scared or unable to get to hospital. Lockdowns don‚Äôt work. pic.twitter.com/wtNDkMJjli ‚Äî The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 29, 2020

MPs are set to vote on the measures in the House of Commons today, with media reporting that as many as between 50 and 100 Tories will rebel against their own government and vote against them, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.

The Guardian has also reported that Labour plans to abstain from voting, because the financial support, derived from taxpayers, for the hospitality industry must go further than the government‚Äôs recovery package.

Tier 2 bans socialising indoors with anyone outside their house or support bubble and limits it to six outdoors, while Tier 3 prohibits any mixing with people not in your household or bubble inside or in most outdoor settings. Tier 3 also sees pubs, bars, and restaurants close unless they can function as takeaways, while in Tier 2, alcohol at hospitality venues can only be served with a ‚Äòsubstantial meal‚Äô.

Conservative lockdown sceptics from the COVID Recovery Group won a minor battle in forcing the Johnson administration to release the impact assessments that informed the government‚Äôs decision, but MPs are said to be disappointed with the document, described as ‚Äúthin‚Äù and containing a ‚Äúrehashed‚Äù and frustrating analysis.

UK Minister: You Might Be Banned from Venues Without Vaccine Passport https://t.co/f0UOh7YnkY ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 1, 2020

Chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, Mark Harper, said: ‚ÄúEven with so little time, the government‚Äôs analysis seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny.

‚ÄúBefore the current lockdown, incorrect death and hospital capacity modelling was leaked into the public domain to justify it. We asked for full details. We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections, and they have not been forthcoming.

‚ÄúWe are now seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the government‚Äôs arguments.‚Äù

Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith called the document a ‚Äúcut and paste job‚Äù, insinuating that the government had provided no new analysis at all.

However, despite the anticipated massive Tory rebellion and Labour abstaining, the proposals are expected to pass with support from the Conservative ‚Äúpayroll vote‚Äù government ministers and Johnson loyalists in the backbench, as well as a handful of Labour MPs defying Sir Keir Starmer.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
169,David Mamet Calls Out ‚ÄòExperts‚Äô and Questions Lockdowns: ‚ÄòThe Virus Here Is Government‚Äô,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

‚ÄúThe virus here is government‚Äîor at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,‚Äù Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence‚Äîand they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ ‚Äî WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

‚ÄúWe all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.‚Äù

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. ‚ÄúOne is ‚Äòpermitted‚Äô to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?‚Äù

David Mamet compares today‚Äôs coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin‚Äôs science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. ‚ÄúNow we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe news media, backed by those parts of the ‚Äòscientific community‚Äô the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.‚Äù

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

‚ÄúA pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.‚Äù

171,Labour Party Could Expel ‚ÄòThousands‚Äô of Members for Anti-Semitism,['Kurt Zindulka'],"The deputy leader of the British Labour Party, Angela Rayner, has threatened that thousands of members could be expelled from the party an effort to purge anti-Semitism from their ranks.

On Sunday, Mrs Rayner told members of the party that Labour has to ‚Äúget real‚Äù about anti-Semitism after a Jewish member was forced to leave a constituency party meeting in Nottingham due to a ‚Äúhostile‚Äù environment as some pushed for a restoration of the whip to former leader Jeremy Corbyn.

In response to the incident, the deputy leader said per Sky News: ‚ÄúWe should have a bit of humility, humbleness, and we should be listening and we should be aware of how hurt and upset people are.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd if I have to suspend thousands and thousands of members, we will do that. Because we cannot and we will not accept an injury to one, because an injury to one is an injury to all. That‚Äôs what we say in our movement,‚Äù Rayner warned.

In October, the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) released a report on antisemitism, which found that the Labour Party was responsible for ‚Äúunlawful acts of harassment and discrimination‚Äù against Jewish people under the leadership of radical socialist Jeremey Corbyn.

Mr Corbyn rejected the findings of the report, claiming that the issue of anti-Semitism issue within the party was ‚Äúdramatically overstated for political reasons‚Äù. As a result of his refusal to accept blame or apologise, Corbyn was suspended by the party.

While he was later reinstated, Corbyn‚Äôs replacement as leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has refused to restore the whip to him in parliament, meaning he cannot sit as a Labour MP.

Labour Antisemitism Report Found Borderline ‚ÄòNeo-Nazis‚Äô in the Party https://t.co/ItUKwGXsF9 ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 17, 2020

Mrs Rayner said that she ‚Äúknew‚Äù that Corbyn would refuse to accept the report, saying: ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt think Jeremy really quite gets how upsetting it is, how really upsetting it is when he made those comments.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a matter of public record now that I contacted Jeremy to try and get him not to say what he said, and to apologise and withdraw it afterwards,‚Äù she said.

Sir Keir Starmer has also taken aim at the former far-left leader of the party, describing Corbyn‚Äôs response to the EHRC report as ‚Äújust about as bad as you could get‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this very wrong in recent years and I‚Äôm determined we‚Äôre going to turn this around,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve made it my number one priority and I think we made some progress in the early months.‚Äù

The latest dust-up over the anti-Semitism issue came in response to a Constituency Labour Party (CLP) meeting in Nottingham last Friday, in which the chair of the meeting, Louise Regan, allowed a motion to restore the whip to Mr Corbyn to be tabled, in violation of the party‚Äôs rules.

A local Jewish constituent present at the meeting, Steve Lapsley, 50, said that the environment was so ‚Äúhostile‚Äù against him that he was forced to leave.

Lapsley told the members during the meeting that he had previously been told by another party member ‚Äúwe do not want Jews in the party‚Äù, yet claimed that a witness to incident denied that there was anti-Semitism in the party on Friday.

‚ÄúIt was very triggering. The suspension of Jeremy Corbyn has really upped the anger,‚Äù he said but went on to proclaim that despite everything, he will remain in the Labour Party.

173,Paul Krugman Claims ‚ÄòDemocrats Never Said Trump Was Illegitimate‚Äô; Krugman Said So in 2017,['Joel B. Pollak'],"Byron York of the Washington Examiner caught New York Times columnist Paul Krugman in an easily disprovable lie on Tuesday: claiming that Democrats never called President Donald Trump illegitimate, when he himself did so in 2017.

Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist-turned-partisan pundit, wrote Monday:

When Joe Biden is inaugurated, he will immediately be confronted with an unprecedented challenge ‚Äî and I don‚Äôt mean the pandemic, although Covid-19 will almost surely be killing thousands of Americans every day. I mean, instead, that he‚Äôll be the first modern U.S. president trying to govern in the face of an opposition that refuses to accept his legitimacy. And no, Democrats never said Donald Trump was illegitimate, just that he was incompetent and dangerous.

As York noted, Krugman published a column on January 16, 2017 ‚Äî four days before Trump‚Äôs inauguration ‚Äî in which he quoted Democrat Rep. John Lewis calling Trump illegitimate, and agreed with them. The title of the column was ‚ÄúWith All Due Disrespect.‚Äù In it, Krugman wrote:

But let‚Äôs not talk about Mr. Trump‚Äôs ravings. Instead, let‚Äôs ask whether Mr. Lewis was right to say what he said. Is it O.K., morally and politically, to declare the man about to move into the White House illegitimate? Yes, it is. In fact, it‚Äôs an act of patriotism. ‚Ä¶ [N]o previous U.S. president-elect has had less right to the title. So why shouldn‚Äôt we question his legitimacy?

York noted that leading Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden, openly declared that Trump was illegitimate and spent four years trying to remove him by any means possible, including the flimsy impeachment of 2019-2020.

York concludes: ‚ÄúThe attempt to throw it all down the memory hole is more than just an embarrassment for Krugman and the New York Times. It also encourages a sense of grievance ‚Äî They won‚Äôt accept Biden‚Äôs legitimacy! ‚Äî that is utterly ignorant of recent events. Some Democrats not only declared Donald Trump an illegitimate president before he was even sworn in ‚Äî they spent the next years trying to remove him from office, abusing the powers of investigation in the hope that even if he survived he would be so weakened that he could not win re-election. No one should forget ‚Äî or ignore ‚Äî what happened.‚Äù

174,World Urged to Drink Australian Wine to Hit Back at 'Bully' Beijing,['Simon Kent'],"Buy an Australian bottle of wine or two (or three) in December and show Chinese President Xi Jinping the world will not be cowed by his ‚Äúbullying of Australia.‚Äù

That was the simple call Tuesday from the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China (IPAC), comprising more than 200 MPs from a range of political parties and representing 19 country legislatures.

The political grouping has launched a campaign to convince people to enjoy Australian wine in December, as a show of solidarity with the land Down Under, as The Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The call to drink up comes just three days after Beijing turned the screws on Australian wine exports with punitive tariffs of up to 212 percent, essentially closing off a U.S.$1 billion market.

As Breitbart News reported, biting new Chinese trade tariffs across the board have stoked fears Australia‚Äôs virus-weakened economy is being targeted for political retribution and the two countries may be sliding into a shadow trade war after a year-long confrontation that began with claims over the origins of the coronavirus.

176,Pope Francis Calls for ‚ÄòNew Social Justice‚Äô to Challenge Utopia,['Thomas D. Williams'],"ROME ‚Äî Pope Francis called for a ‚Äúnew social justice‚Äù Sunday in which all well-intentioned people will challenge the reigning utopia.

Addressing ‚Äúsocial justice judges‚Äù from the African and American continents via streaming, the pope congratulated them for their commitment to ‚Äúsocial rights,‚Äù asserting that the very fact that men and women ‚Äúcome together to think about their work and to build the new social justice is, without a doubt, excellent news.‚Äù

The pontiff, who has been a vocal proponent of a ‚Äúgreat reset‚Äù after the coronavirus pandemic, urged his hearers to ‚Äúnot lose sight of the distressing picture in which a small part of humanity lives in opulence, while an increasingly large number lives without dignity with their most elementary rights ignored or violated.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe cannot think disconnected from reality,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd this is a reality that you must bear in mind.‚Äù

Pope Francis has called on Christians to break down walls and embrace a love without borders in a new encyclical letter released on Sunday. https://t.co/6THB1aGBPb ‚Äî Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) October 4, 2020

The pope insisted that social justice is ‚Äúa collective work‚Äù in which all people of good will challenge the reigning utopia. ‚ÄúJustice is a task that has to be conquered every day, because the imbalance is a temptation of every minute,‚Äù he said.

Justice also involves overcoming the temptation to ignore others, ‚Äúespecially the weakest,‚Äù Francis said, lamenting that ‚Äúwe have become used to sidestepping or ignoring situations until they impact us directly.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnconditional commitment means taking charge of the pain of the other and not slipping into a culture of indifference,‚Äù he added.

In their task of bringing about a ‚Äúnew social justice for the planet,‚Äù the pope urged his hearers to pay attention to history, to draw inspiration from ‚Äúthe struggles, the triumphs, and the defeats‚Äù of those who gave their lives for ‚Äúa full and integrated humanity.‚Äù

This effort will only succeed if it takes place as a grassroots initiative involving all people, ‚Äúwithout pretending to be an enlightened elite,‚Äù Francis said, because ‚Äúwhat God asks of us believers is to be God‚Äôs people, not God‚Äôs elite.‚Äù

In the battle for social justice solidarity is necessary to overcome ‚Äúthe structural causes of poverty, inequality, lack of work, land and housing,‚Äù he said.

Pope Francis reflected Wednesday on the importance of the intercession of the Virgin Mary, proposing that without her intervention at the wedding feast in Cana the guests would have drunk milk rather than wine. https://t.co/zwMeQtwEtI ‚Äî Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 19, 2020

We must fight, he said, ‚Äúagainst those who deny social and labor rights‚Äù and ‚Äúagainst a culture that leads people to use others, to enslave others, and ends up taking away the dignity of others.‚Äù

When we give essential things to the poor, he said, ‚Äúwe do not give them our things, or that of third parties, but we give them back what is theirs.‚Äù

The Christian tradition ‚Äúnever recognized the right to private property as absolute and untouchable,‚Äù he added, but ‚Äúalways emphasized its social function in any of its forms.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no social justice that can be based on inequity, which involves the concentration of wealth,‚Äù he said.

177,Coronavirus Robs Biblical Bethlehem of Christmas Cheer,['Breitbart News'],"BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) ‚Äî The coronavirus has cast a pall over Christmas celebrations in Bethlehem, all but shutting down the biblical town revered as Jesus‚Äô birthplace at the height of the normally cheery holiday season.

Missing are the thousands of international pilgrims who normally descend upon the town. Restaurants, hotels and souvenir shops are closed. The renowned Christmas tree lighting service will be limited to a small group of authorized people, as will church services on Christmas Eve.

‚ÄúBethlehem is dead,‚Äù said Maryana al-Arja, owner of the 120-room Angel Hotel on the outskirts of Bethlehem.

The hotel was the site of the West Bank‚Äôs first coronavirus outbreak ‚Äî when a group of Greek tourists came down with the virus last March.

She kept her 25 workers on staff for several months but ultimately couldn‚Äôt continue to pay them. Al-Arja, who herself was infected with the virus, said she has been forced to close the hotel and lay off the entire staff because there is no sign of the pandemic ending or tourists visiting anytime soon.

‚ÄúWe had 351 tourist groups booked in our hotel this year, each one 150 people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBut they all canceled.‚Äù

Elyas al-Arja, the head of the city‚Äôs hotel association, said Bethlehem received some 3 million tourists in 2019. With Israel, the main entry point for international visitors to the region, banning tourists because of the coronavirus crisis, and the West Bank‚Äôs border crossing with Jordan closed to foreigners, that number is close to zero this year, he said.

‚ÄúSixty percent of the city relies on tourism, and their income disappeared when the tourists disappeared,‚Äù said al-Arja, a cousin of the Angel Hotel owner.

The Ambassador Hotel, which is located near the Church of the Nativity, built on the site where Christians believe Jesus was born, has reopened one floor in hopes that some local visitors may want to come celebrate in the coming weeks.

Mahmoud Tarman, the hotel‚Äôs receptionist, said the Ambassador has brought back eight of its 60 workers to serve local guests. But with the West Bank‚Äôs economy devastated by repeated lockdowns, it remains unclear how many people will come.

‚ÄúAt this time of the year, this empty hotel would be bustling with life. But as you see, there is no life, not even a Christmas tree yet,‚Äù he said as he pointed at the empty lobby.

The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, this week imposed a new nighttime lockdown to help contain a spike in coronavirus cases. People must remain indoors from 7 p.m. until 6 a.m., and Bethlehem is included in the lockdown.

Officials say the lockdown could be extended through Christmas and into the new year if the infection levels don‚Äôt come down. The Health Ministry has reported a total of about 65,000 coronavirus cases in the West Bank, and over 620 deaths.

Bethlehem‚Äôs mayor, Anton Salman, said the city had planned to receive 3,000 invited guests, including local scout troops and musical bands from around the world that normally entertain visitors during Christmas Eve festivities.

He said the famed Christmas tree lighting, scheduled on Thursday, will be limited to just 15 guests, including local mayors, the district governor and the Latin Patriarch and other clergy. The 85-year-old Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, who usually joins the celebration, has been invited but has not said whether he will attend.

Midnight Mass, a solemn event led by the Latin Patriarch that is usually attended by religious leaders, local VIPs and hundreds of pilgrims from around the world, has also been scaled back, Salman said. He said officials are still working on the guest list, but it is expected to include religious leaders and some foreign diplomats. The event will be closed to the general public but broadcast live for people to watch.

Archbishop Cordileone objected to the state‚Äôs lumping together of religious worship with ‚Äúnon-essential indoor activities such as gyms, movie theaters, and museums‚Äù while arbitrarily allowing ‚Äúfor indoor retail at 25 percent capacity and permits massage parlors, hair and nail salons, and tattoo parlors to operate indoors.‚Äù

In his statement, the archbishop criticized a new health order from the state of California that places San Francisco and San Mateo Counties into a more restrictive ‚Äúpurple‚Äù tier of coronavirus restrictions, which unfairly denigrates the right to religious worship.

‚ÄúThis is precisely the kind of blatant discrimination to which the Supreme Court gave injunctive relief in New York,‚Äù Cordileone said, in reference to last Wednesday‚Äôs SCOTUS ruling barring the state from enforcing certain attendance limits at houses of worship.

Even in a pandemic, ‚Äúthe Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten,‚Äù Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in the 5-4 decision. ‚ÄúThe restrictions at issue here, by effectively barring many from attending religious services, strike at the very heart of the First Amendment‚Äôs guarantee of religious liberty.‚Äù

England‚Äôs faith leaders have united in calling on the UK government to permit public worship during the forthcoming lockdown in England, insisting that such worship is ‚Äúessential.‚Äù https://t.co/FohO0VnRAE ‚Äî Breitbart News (@BreitbartNews) November 3, 2020

The San Francisco archbishop insisted in his statement that for Catholic Christians, worship of God and the reception of the sacraments are ‚Äúessential‚Äù activities.

‚ÄúThe government is demoting worship to the same status as watching a movie: ‚Äònon-essential,‚Äô‚Äù Cordileone said. ‚ÄúBut worship is both a natural and a Constitutional right. My people want to receive the Body and Blood of Christ; they need it, and have every right to be free to do so.‚Äù

Cordileone also insisted that his archdiocese has adhered scrupulously to measures mandated to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

‚ÄúCatholics in San Francisco are absolutely committed to public safety in conducting worship services,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur protocols require masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut the government still chooses to treat worship as less important than shopping for shoes,‚Äù he added.

While declaring that he is ‚Äúdeeply sympathetic to public health concerns about a surge in COVID hospitalizations,‚Äù the archbishop also noted that ‚Äúwe know of no cases of transmission of the virus as a result of in-person worship inside of our churches.‚Äù

179,No Twitter ‚ÄòFact Check‚Äô Warning on Chinese Official‚Äôs Fake Photo of Australian Soldier Beheading Child,['Simon Kent'],"Twitter on Tuesday rejected Canberra‚Äôs calls to remove a Beijing official‚Äôs gruesome tweet targeting Australian troops, choosing instead to stand with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As Breitbart News reported, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded Beijing apologize after a top CCP official posted an obviously contrived image on Twitter depicting an Australian soldier with his knife to a child‚Äôs throat, appearing to prepare to behead the victim.

Morrison described the post by the official Twitter account of Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as an ‚Äúoutrageous and disgusting slur‚Äù at a virtual news conference in Canberra on Monday.

AFP reports Twitter said it had since marked the tweet as ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù but added comments on topical political issues or ‚Äúforeign policy sabre-rattling‚Äù by official government accounts were generally not in violation of its rules.

Twitter is banned for most citizens in China and Beijing has for decades been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

Some Australian allies expressed concern over the tweet, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with the support coming as Australia looks to strengthen its alliances in the Indo/Pacific region as a guard against Beijing‚Äôs increasingly strident diplomacy.

‚ÄúIn this case an image has been used that is not factually correct, that is not a genuine image, so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities,‚Äù she told reporters.

The French foreign affairs ministry said the post was ‚Äúunworthy of the diplomatic standards we have the right to expect from a country like China‚Äù.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra dismissed the criticism, instead accusing Australia of making too much of the incident.

‚ÄúThe rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr. Zhao‚Äôs tweet,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

The embassy suggested Australian officials were attempting to ‚Äúdeflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers‚Äù and ‚Äústoke domestic nationalism.‚Äù

180,UK Minister: You Might Be Banned from Venues Without Vaccine Passport,['Victoria Friedman'],"The UK‚Äôs new vaccine minister Nadim Zahawi has said that while coronavirus vaccinations will not be mandatory, Britons may be barred from going to the cinema or getting on an aeroplane without it if service providers demand proof of inoculation.

Conservative MP Nadim Zahawi is the newly-appointed Minister for COVID Vaccine Deployment and will oversee the rollout of the vaccination in England.

Mr Zahawi said that of the three vaccines currently being developed in the UK ‚Äî by Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Moderna ‚Äî the Pfizer product is the most far along and likely to be widely rolled out first.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4‚Äôs World at One on Monday, Mr Zahawi confirmed that the vaccine would not be compulsory and would remain voluntary.

However, the demand for ‚Äúimmunity passports‚Äù to secure service ‚Äî such as by Australian airline Qantas ‚Äî may make the jabs effectively compulsory by any other definition.

When host Sarah Montague asked if could follow that British businesses could demand an immunity passport before a person can go to a stadium to watch a football match, the COVID vaccination minister did not deny such an outcome, rather adding that the government was looking for a system comparable to the NHS‚Äôs ‚ÄòTest and Trace‚Äô app, which tracks the spread of coronavirus.

Mr Zahawi said: ‚ÄúWe are looking at the technology and of course a way of people informing their GP that they‚Äôve been vaccinated.

‚ÄúBut also I think you‚Äôll probably find that restaurants, bars, and cinemas and other venues ‚Äî sports venues ‚Äî will probably also use that system as they‚Äôve done with the app.‚Äù

Minister ‚ÄòCan‚Äôt Rule Out‚Äô THIRD Lockdown, Says No Normality Until Summer https://t.co/sUwnCaISlR ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 30, 2020

The Times had reported on Monday that the NHS is working on updating the Test and Trace app to include the information in its data architecture so that Britons can confirm their inoculation status.

The vaccine tsar admitted that without the availability of Big Government‚Äôs tech, there would be no demand for such ‚ÄòCOVID passports‚Äô by service providers, saying: ‚ÄúIn many ways, the pressure from both ways: from service providers who will say, ‚ÄòDemonstrate to us that you‚Äôve been vaccinated,‚Äô but also we will make the technology as easy and accessible as possible.‚Äù

Sarah Montague asked Mr Zahawi whether or not it would become ‚Äúvirtually impossible to do anything if you don‚Äôt have the vaccine‚Äù, with the minister responding: ‚ÄúI think people have to make a decision, but I think you‚Äôll probably find many service providers will want to engage in this in the way they did with the [Test and Trace] app.‚Äù

The minister‚Äôs comments come after reports that the government is also working on coronavirus stamps for passports in order to boost the travel and tourism industry. The government is also reportedly working on so-called ‚Äúfreedom passes‚Äù for those who have tested negative for the Chinese coronavirus, which could allow them to be free from having to wear a mask or to visit family members during lockdowns.

Former Brexit Party MEP, now Lady Fox of Buckley in the House of Lords, Claire Fox responded to Zahawi‚Äôs remarks on Monday evening, saying: ‚ÄúWhen Boris assured us that no-one would be forced to vaccinate, he forgot to add, ‚Äòbut if you don‚Äôt, you will be effectively prevented from being part of the public sphere, ever‚Äô. Public shaming next? I want to be an enthusiastic advocate for vaccines. This COERCION doesn‚Äôt help.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
181,Farage: China is ‚ÄòLicking its Chops‚Äô at the Thought of a Biden Presidency,['Kurt Zindulka'],"The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is ‚Äúlicking its chops‚Äù at the thought of a Joe Biden presidency, warned Brexit leader and longtime ally of President Donald Trump, Nigel Farage.

Mr Farage argued that China ‚Äúhas ruined the world in 2020‚Äù through its handling of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which it should be forced to pay ‚Äúvery heavy reparations‚Äù. Yet, he predicted that with Joe Biden preparing to ascend to the presidency, the CCP will continue its push for global supremacy.

‚ÄúChina‚Äôs economy is powering ahead, and its leaders are bullying weaker Western nations,‚Äù Farage wrote in Newsweek. Indeed, British newspaper The Times reports Tuesday that the Chinese economy is on track to be the first worldwide to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúWith Trump all but gone from the White House, and faltering Joe Biden preparing to move in, it now looks as though China‚Äôs quest for world domination is back on track. What a calamity,‚Äù Mr Farage lamented.

Mr Farage went on to recall a speech he gave during a Trump campaign rally in Arizona, remarking that the line which resonated with the crowd the most was when he asked the crowd: ‚ÄúWho else among Western leaders has the courage to stand up to the rapacious Chinese Communist Party if not Donald J. Trump?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe crowd roared, knowing full well that Biden would not show such strength in the face of the Chinese threat,‚Äù Farage said.

Farage Predicts UK-Style Postal Voting Fraud Will Be Found, Trump Will Be Back in 2024 If He Loses https://t.co/lUuq4BfATB ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 5, 2020

Mr Farage said that in the wake of Joe Biden‚Äôs apparent victory, China has ‚Äúwasted no time in trying to reassert its authority over the world‚Äù, noting the increasingly tough rhetoric coming from the communist government and state-linked businesses.

He pointed to statements from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian in November, in which he threatened the Five Eyes intelligence alliance of the United States, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, after the bloc criticised the CCP‚Äôs move to ban four opposition leaders from the Hong Kong Legislative Council.

Mr Zhao said: ‚ÄúNo matter how many ‚Äòeyes‚Äô you have, be careful not to be poked and get blind by harming China‚Äôs sovereignty, security and development interests.‚Äù

Farage characterised the rhetoric as ‚Äúthe language of a thuggish mafia don,‚Äù questioning: ‚ÄúWho would wish to have anything to do with an individual who spoke in such a way?‚Äù

The veteran Brexit campaigner went onto decry the veiled threats from Hauwei Vice President Victor Zhang, who said that the UK should reconsider its ban on Huawei equipment from its 5G networks, claiming that the decision was motivated by pressure from the Trump administration during its trade war with China, rather than for security purposes.

The chief technology officer for Huawei, Paul Scanlan also said in November that the company will be seeking a ‚Äúreset‚Äù of relations with the United States and other Western powers under a Biden administration.

Nigel Farage: Only Trump Has Stood up to China, But Citizens of the West Must Stand up Next https://t.co/q8LRA7Gjtd ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) April 20, 2020

Last week, the Global Times ‚Äî one of China‚Äôs more belligerent state-run mouthpieces ‚Äî ran an opinion article, in which they told Mr Biden to abandon the ‚Äúreckless pursuit of the Indo-Pacific strategy‚Äù of President Trump and to put a halt to ‚Äústirring up the region‚Äù by confronting Beijing‚Äôs expansionism in the region.

The Chinese Communist paper went on to suggest that Biden accept his ‚Äúhistoric responsibility‚Äù and to ‚Äúexplore and create an unprecedented win-win situation‚Äù in partnership with China‚Äù.

While the Biden campaign has paid lip-service to the idea of confronting the CCP, Mr Biden‚Äôs pick for National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan has openly advocated for the United States to support the ‚Äúrise‚Äù of China.

‚ÄúWe need to strike a middle course ‚Äì one that encourages China‚Äôs rise in a manner consistent with an open, fair, rules-based, regional order,‚Äù Sullivan said in 2017.

The Obama administration alumn went on to argue that for the good of the global economy, a thriving China is critical, though he did say that it was important to determine the ‚Äúparameters of the system within which China is rising.‚Äù

182,CA Democrat Christy Smith Concedes to Republican Rep. Mike Garcia,['Kristina Wong'],"Democrat candidate California State Assemblywoman Christy Smith conceded to incumbent Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA) Monday in the race for California‚Äôs 25th Congressional District ‚Äî former Rep. Katie Hill (D-CA)‚Äôs seat before she resigned.

Garcia had a slim lead of just 339 votes, but Smith said it was clear that amount could not be overcome. She wrote on Facebook:

This is not the end result we fought for, but I am proud of the strong, grassroots campaign we ran. Over the last few weeks, our attorneys reviewed thousands of uncounted ballots, and our campaign volunteers undertook an extraordinary effort to cure hundreds of votes throughout the district that otherwise may not have been counted. We exhausted every possible option, and did everything within our power to ensure that every voice in this election was heard. Nonetheless, we came up short.

Garcia, a Navy combat pilot, issued a statement on Monday that said his focus is on representing all constituents in the district.

Garcia said, according to CBSLA.:

My focus is on representing all constituents in CA-25. In the short term, this means pushing to get federal relief to those who are most impacted by COVID, individuals and small businesses. It‚Äôs been a tough election, but the fight has been worth it. I am looking forward to two more years. Thank you CA-25!

After a special election in March for Hill‚Äôs seat did not produce a candidate with a majority of votes, Smith and Garcia faced a run-off in May. Garcia won and was sworn in. The November 3 race is for a full two-year term.

Garcia called the race an ‚Äúexistential fight‚Äù for the nation in an October interview with SiriusXM‚Äôs Breitbart News Saturday.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm making sure that what‚Äôs happened to our state of California doesn‚Äôt happen at the national level. We have some of the highest taxes, thick bureaucracy that‚Äôs killing small businesses and making people want to leave California, and there‚Äôs a reason for that,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúA lot of the ills that we‚Äôre experiencing here in what should be a very beautiful state, a very thriving state, are now being uploaded to the federal level,‚Äù he said.

He also blasted California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA)‚Äôs COVID policies that were handcuffing the economy. ‚ÄúWe need to get our kids back in school, we need to get our business back online, reopen the amusement parks and start realizing the full potential that we have,‚Äù he said.

Garcia, a former Navy pilot, added: ‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs the fight we‚Äôre fighting right now, and people are paying attention.‚Äù

184,Stacey Abrams Voter Registration Group Denies Impropriety,['Kyle Morris'],"Brad Raffensperger, Georgia‚Äôs Republican Secretary of State, resurrected a tired and false claim against the New Georgia Project‚Äôs legitimate efforts to register eligible Georgians to participate in elections in a press conference held Monday morning, November 30th.

Nse Ufot, Executive Director of the New Georgia Project said:

As Georgians are turning out in record numbers to have their voices heard at the polls, the Secretary of State is resorting to desperate attempts to smear law-abiding organizations and scare eligible Georgians from registering to vote in critical upcoming elections. We will not be deterred. This attack on our organization comes at a time when people across the country have witnessed the strength of our program and the collective power of a new Georgia electorate that embraces a system of inclusivity and opportunity for all Georgians. The timing is not accidental.

The organization also stated that it will ‚Äúcontinue its mission to register eligible voters in advance of the December 7th deadline‚Äù in its efforts to make sure that Georgia residents ‚Äúhave their voices heard at the polls and freely and fairly cast their ballots for those who would represent them.‚Äù

Raffensperger announced earlier Monday that his office will launch an investigation into voting groups accused of encouraging non-Georgia residents to register to vote in the runoff elections, which are set to take place on January 5.

‚ÄúWe have opened an investigation into a group called America Votes, who is sending absentee ballot applications to people at addresses where they have not lived since 1994,‚Äù Raffensperger said during a press conference, adding:

Voting in Georgia when you are not a resident of Georgia is a felony, and encouraging college kids to commit felonies with no regard for what [it] might mean for them is despicable. These third-party groups have a responsibility to not encourage illegal voting. If they do so, they will be held responsible.

Other organizations set to face scrutiny from the investigation include America Votes, Operation New Voter Registration Georgia, and Vote Forward.

Last week, Abrams announced that 900,000 Georgians had requested a mail-in ballot for the runoff elections between Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) and her Democrat challenger Raphael Warnock, and another between Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and his Democrat opponent Jon Ossoff.

Interestingly, the Washington Free Beacon reported that Warnock served as the CEO of The New Georgia Project until February of this year.

‚ÄúWarnock was listed as CEO of the New Georgia Project from 2017 until Feb. 21, 2020, according to the group‚Äôs corporate filings,‚Äù the report stated. ‚ÄúHe has been identified as the New Georgia Project‚Äôs chairman and spokesman in media reports and has said he organized voter mobilization drives for the group, including a push to register 80,000 new minority voters in 2014.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
185,Sarah Fuller‚Äôs Halftime Speech Has Some Accusing Vanderbilt of a Publicity Stunt,['Lara Gwinn'],"Vanderbilt senior kicker Sarah Fuller made history on Saturday, becoming the first woman to play on the field in a Power 5 college football game, during the second-half kickoff against the Missouri Tigers. However, recent reports about what happened at halftime before her history-making kick have some believing that her presence on the field may have had more to do with publicity than football.

ESPN reporter Courtney Cronin tweeted on Sunday that she had just ended a Zoom interview with Fuller, where the history-making kicker detailed her halftime locker room speech. ‚ÄúI had coaches come up to me and say ‚ÄòI‚Äôve been wanting to say that for awhile now,'‚Äù Fuller reportedly said:

Fuller reportedly said to her new teammates:

If I‚Äôm going to be honest, I was a little pissed off at how quiet everybody was on the sideline. ‚Ä¶ We made a first down, and I was the only one cheering and I was like ‚Äì what the heck? What‚Äôs going on? And I tried to get them pumped up, and I was like, ‚ÄòYou guys need to start [cheering] your team on.‚Äô

My main thing was during the SEC tournament, my entire team was cheering the entire time. It didn‚Äôt matter if we were in the locker room or if they were on the sidelines, I think that‚Äôs what won it for us. Everybody was cheering non-stop. I just went in there, and I said exactly what I was thinking. I was like, ‚ÄòWe need to be cheering each other on. This is how you win games. This is how you get better by calling each other out for stuff, and I‚Äôm going to call you guys out.‚Äô We need to be supporting one another. If we get a first down, if an interception happens, it‚Äôs our fault. We need to be lifting each other up. That‚Äôs what a team‚Äôs about. I think this team has struggled, and that‚Äôs been part of it. We really just need to build that team camaraderie where they can all lean on one another. It was an adjustment going from that team mentality where ‚Äì hey, we‚Äôre all here supporting one another, and I just wanted to bring that to this team.

Some took issue with Fuller‚Äôs locker room speech in particular. Joe Kinsey from Outkick questioned Fuller‚Äôs and Vanderbilt‚Äôs intent:

If you were on the fence about whether Vanderbilt using soccer goalie Sarah Fuller as a fill-in kicker for Saturday‚Äôs game against Missouri was a publicity stunt or a necessity, you got your answer on Sunday when it was announced that Fuller had given a halftime speech to her new teammates. Keep in mind, Fuller hadn‚Äôt yet stepped foot on the field for her kickoff before giving this speech. ‚Ä¶ As for this speech, you mean to tell me that a kicker who was pulled off the women‚Äôs soccer team and who started practicing with the football team on Tuesday was given the floor to lecture teammates on Saturday?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think freshman players on the women‚Äôs soccer team who‚Äôve never seen the field get up and give speeches to players who‚Äôve given four years to a program? Nope. Not happening,‚Äù Kinsey said.

Responses to Cronin‚Äôs tweet also questioned the validity of Vanderbilt‚Äôs intentions, with one person saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm all for her kicking, but this is absurd. Imagine a male walk on kicker of any sort showing up 7 games into the season, not even kicking yet, then lecturing the team about not cheering hard enough bc that‚Äôs what they did on his soccer team.‚Äù

Another response read, ‚ÄúI mean man or woman, what gives a soccer player who‚Äôs been on the team 3 days the RIGHT to stand up and call out players. Imagine being a senior in this locker room. What gives her the authority to do this? Especially a kicker?? Nah.. this ain‚Äôt it.‚Äù

Others supported Fuller‚Äôs place on the team as a needed move for Vanderbilt. Radio host Pat McAfee said, ‚ÄúShe was not out asking for this.. An opportunity presented itself,‚Äù and that it was not a publicity stunt:

The video shows Warnock speaking against the Safe Carry Protection Act, which Georgia lawmakers enacted in 2014. The act expanded the number of places law-abiding citizens could carry guns for self-defense in the hopes of reducing the number of gun-free zones, thereby reducing the number of soft targets available to criminals and/or demented attackers.

The video, posted by the NRA, shows Warnock saying, ‚ÄúSomebody decided that they had a bright idea to pass a piece of legislation that will allow for guns and concealed weapons to be carried in churches.‚Äù

He went on to mock the idea of carrying a gun in a church meeting, suggesting such meetings are the ‚Äúlast place‚Äù where carrying a firearm ought to be allowed.

On November 5, 2017, Stephen Willeford‚Äôs daughter told him she heard gun shots at the nearby First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Willeford grabbed an AR-15 and ran to the scene, making contact with the attacker, then shooting and wounding him to stop the attack.

The heinous attack that brought Willeford running resulted in a Texas law allowing concealed carry permit holders to be armed in their churches and houses of worship for self-defense.

The law allowing self-defense carry in churches took effect in September 2019 and just months later, on December 29, 2019, an armed church member, who was also a volunteer church security team member, took out an armed attacker and saved countless lives. Because Jack Wilson was armed and ready, the attacker sustained a lethal bullet wound immediately after he shot and killed an innocent.

Surveillance video of the December 29, 2019, attack shows the attacker pull a shotgun out from his jacket, only to be killed within seconds by Wilson. As the video rolls, other armed congregants can be seen rising from their seats and converging on the attacker‚Äôs position:

The Safe Carry Protection Act was designed to give Georgians the kind of fighting chance that the world saw on display when Wilson shot the attacker in the White Settlement, Texas, church. But Warnock mocked the idea of churchgoers being armed for defense of themselves and others.

189,Biden's Top Economic Adviser Tied to Delphi Pension-Slashing Scheme,['John Binder'],"Democrat Joe Biden‚Äôs pick to be his top economic adviser in the White House served on the Obama-appointed team that helped slash pensions for roughly 20,000 Americans in the auto bailout.

This week, Biden announced that Obama alum Brian Deese, now an executive at the investment management firm BlackRock, will serve as his top economic adviser should he enter the White House.

Deese previously served as a special assistant to Obama for economic policy and played a role in the administration‚Äôs bailout of the auto industry, which ultimately led to slashed pensions for 20,000 non-union workers at the Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier to General Motors (GM).

In 2009, as part of the Obama-Biden administration‚Äôs taxpayer-funded bailout of GM, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) terminated the pension plans of non-unionized Delphi workers. In some cases, workers had their pensions gutted by as much as 75 percent.

A federal report in 2013 detailed that the Delphi workers would likely have their pensions cut by an estimated $440 million. Meanwhile, GM topped off unionized Delphi workers‚Äô pensions at a cost of about $1 billion.

Deese, along with agency heads like Timothy Geithner and top advisers like Ron Bloom, was named in that federal report, having had been involved in multiple conversations about the Delphi pensions:

In July 2009, internal Government emails between the Auto Team and Advisor to the President Brian Deese discussed GM‚Äôs need to address issues with Delphi‚Äôs ‚Äúsplinter unions.‚Äù Auto Team officials did not recall details related to the emails. When Senator Charles Schumer took a position that GM should assume the Delphi salaried retiree pensions, Mr. Deese emailed Mr. Rattner this ‚Äúmay complicate the optics of doing anything for the splinters.‚Äù Other emails from Mr. Deese stated, ‚ÄúWe will continue to face intense scrutiny on this issue. The politics of terminations is quite intense‚Äù and ‚Äúwe need to work on a clear rationale for the outcomes we‚Äôre moving toward, as well as an explanation of respective roles.‚Äù Mr. Rattner emailed members of the Auto Team that he had spoken with Fritz Henderson about ‚Äúour logic on the splinters, which he [Henderson] was fine with. [Auto Team Analyst] Sadiq [Malik] should speak to Janice [Uhlig] about the details, particularly how the reallocation of the $417mm would work.‚Äù Auto Team member Feldman emailed members of the Auto Team about health care/pension benefit changes for IUE and USW employees, and Mr. Deese responded that the company‚Äôs organizing principle was parity between GM salaried and non-UAW hourlies. Mr. Deese referenced a discussion about health care costs and the ‚Äúcredible fairness arguments to augment the hourlies‚Äô recovery based on the pension disparity, but that for all the reasons we discussed that would not be possible. However, I think the logic of that conclusion strongly counsels in favor of bringing the top-up through. Otherwise, we‚Äôre moving in the opposite direction from a position that we all agreed was itself on the edge of fairness.‚Äù

In October, President Trump signed a memorandum to devise a plan to restore the pensions of the Delphi workers. Biden has not said if he supports the memorandum.

Former Delphi workers told Breitbart News in interviews how the pension-slashing scheme uprooted their livelihoods. One retiree said she lost her home, and her retirement plans to move to the Florida coast have been squashed.

Another retiree said his wife died in the process, as he was forced to find work in order to pay for her medical bills. He had assumed that after 30 years at Delphi, he and his wife would have a good healthcare plan in their retirement. That ended when his pension was cut by about 30 percent.

Delphi, which has since split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies, announced in 2006 that it would shutter 21 of its 29 plants in the United States ‚Äî offshoring some 20,000 U.S. jobs to Mexico, China, and other foreign countries.

At the time, Delphi employed nearly 50,000 Americans, who earned about $30 an hour on the assembly line. Now, workers in Mexico for the company earn about $1 an hour.

190,Global Smartphone Sales Drop 5.7 Percent in Q3 2020,['Tom Ciccotta'],"A new report published this week revealed that global smartphone sales dropped almost six percent during the third quarter of 2020. During the same period, Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi passed Apple to become the third-largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.

According to a report by Gartner, global smartphone sales dropped by nearly six percent in the third quarter of 2020.

Anshul Gupta, a senior researcher at Gartner, argues that the decrease in smartphone sales was likely caused by coronavirus lockdowns, which have forced many consumers to limit their spending.

‚ÄúConsumers are limiting their discretionary spend even as some lockdown conditions have started to improve,‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúGlobal smartphone sales experienced moderate growth from the second quarter of 2020 to the third quarter. This was due to pent-up demand from previous quarters.‚Äù

‚ÄúEarly signs of recovery can be seen in a few markets, including parts of mature Asia/Pacific and Latin America. Near normal conditions in China improved smartphone production to fill in the supply gap in the third quarter which benefited sales to some extent,‚Äù Gupta added. ‚ÄúFor the first time this year, smartphone sales to end users in three of the top five markets i.e., India, Indonesia and Brazil increased, growing 9.3%, 8.5% and 3.3%, respectively.‚Äù

The report also revealed that Apple now trails Samsung, Huawei, and Xiaomi with regards to market share in the smartphone industry. Previously, Apple occupied the third spot on the list. It was surpassed in the third quarter by Xiaomi, due in part to the delayed shipment of iPhone 12 models.

Breitbart News reported this week on a rumor that Apple may remove the charging port from next year‚Äôs line of iPhones. The Silicon Valley giant faced criticism when it removed the headphone port from its smartphones in 2016.

191,Christopher Columbus Expert ‚ÄòAppalled‚Äô by Notre Dame‚Äôs Censorship of Murals Featuring Explorer,['Tom Ciccotta'],"The University of Notre Dame announced over the summer that it would cover 12 murals of Christopher Columbus with tapestries inspired by Native American artwork. Now former Stanford professor Carol Delaney, who wrote a book examining Christopher Columbus‚Äô legacy, is speaking out. Delaney says she is ‚Äúappalled‚Äù by Notre Dame‚Äôs censorship, claiming Columbus is ‚Äúnot the man‚Äù social justice activists claim.

According to a report by Campus Reform, a retired Stanford professor is pushing back this week against the University of Notre Dame‚Äôs effort to cover up murals of Christopher Columbus. The murals were covered up by tapestries in the style of Native American artwork as part of a larger effort by the university to reexamine popular narratives about Christopher Columbus.

Activists have pushed to replace Columbus day for some time. Breitbart News reported in September that officials in Baltimore pushed to replace a monument to Columbus with a ‚Äúpolice violence victims‚Äù monument.

The Notre Dame murals were painted by Vatican painter Luigi Gregori in the university‚Äôs main building between 1882 and 1884. In August, they were completely covered by tapestries that hang over the historic murals.

Last week, Delaney, who authored a book titled, Columbus and the Quest for Jerusalem: How Religion Drove the Voyages that Led to America, told Campus Reform that the university‚Äôs decision to ‚ÄúI am appalled at what Notre Dame is doing,‚Äù Delaney said. ‚ÄúInstead they [Columbus‚Äô detractors] need to learn more about Columbus.. he is not the man they think he is‚Ä¶and also why not have two murals!‚Äù

The university explains on its website that the decision to cover the mural prompted a conversation on campus about Columbus‚Äô legacy.

In autumn of 2020, the Christopher Columbus murals of 1882-1884 by the Vatican-based painter Luigi Gregori in the University‚Äôs Main Building were covered with removable tapestries. This followed an intensive period of discussion, research and reflection across the Notre Dame and regional communities on how best to address a complex narrative that was considered celebratory in the late 19th century but that many found troubling by the early 21st century ‚Äì- especially in its depiction of Native Americans.

192,Tesla Will Be Added to S&P 500 in December,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 index on December 21 in a single step despite concerns that the move could impact the U.S. stock market. Tesla CEO Elon Musk made $100 billion in 2020 alone, making him the world‚Äôs second-richest man.

According to a report by CNBC, Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 on December 21 in a single step despite concerns that such a move could disrupt the stock market. Tesla, which is valued at $500 billion, is the largest company to ever be added to the S&P 500 index.

Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said that the S&P 500 spoke with members of the investment community prior to its decision to add Tesla in a single step.

‚ÄúThe fact that when S&P originally made the announcement they sought feedback from the investment community on how to handle the addition tells you all you need to know to show how unique a situation this is,‚Äù Hickey said.

In a statement, S&P Dow Jones Indices said that the decision to add Tesla to the index in this manner was based on a comprehensive overview of the feedback it received from investors.

‚ÄúIn its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market‚Äôs ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,‚Äù

The Associated Press reported on Monday that November marked the S&P 500‚Äôs best month since April. The stock market surged in November on news about the successful development of a COVID-19 vaccine.

193,No Twitter ‚ÄòFact Check‚Äô Warning on Chinese Official‚Äôs Fake Photo of Australian Soldier Beheading Child,['Simon Kent'],"Twitter on Tuesday rejected Canberra‚Äôs calls to remove a Beijing official‚Äôs gruesome tweet targeting Australian troops, choosing instead to stand with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As Breitbart News reported, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded Beijing apologize after a top CCP official posted an obviously contrived image on Twitter depicting an Australian soldier with his knife to a child‚Äôs throat, appearing to prepare to behead the victim.

Morrison described the post by the official Twitter account of Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as an ‚Äúoutrageous and disgusting slur‚Äù at a virtual news conference in Canberra on Monday.

Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, &call for holding them accountable. pic.twitter.com/GYOaucoL5D ‚Äî Lijian Zhao ËµµÁ´ãÂùö (@zlj517) November 30, 2020

AFP reports Twitter said it had since marked the tweet as ‚Äúsensitive,‚Äù but added comments on topical political issues or ‚Äúforeign policy sabre-rattling‚Äù by official government accounts were generally not in violation of its rules.

Twitter is banned for most citizens in China and Beijing has for decades been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

Some Australian allies expressed concern over the tweet, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with the support coming as Australia looks to strengthen its alliances in the Indo/Pacific region as a guard against Beijing‚Äôs increasingly strident diplomacy.

‚ÄúIn this case an image has been used that is not factually correct, that is not a genuine image, so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities,‚Äù she told reporters.

The French foreign affairs ministry said the post was ‚Äúunworthy of the diplomatic standards we have the right to expect from a country like China‚Äù.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra dismissed the criticism, instead accusing Australia of making too much of the incident.

‚ÄúThe rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr. Zhao‚Äôs tweet,‚Äù the spokesperson said.

Ôªø

The embassy suggested Australian officials were attempting to ‚Äúdeflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers‚Äù and ‚Äústoke domestic nationalism.‚Äù

194,"Bitcoin Surges over $19,900 Value, Beats All-Time Record Set in 2017",['Ezra Dulis'],"Bitcoin reached an all-time-high price against the U.S. dollar Monday morning, besting a record set nearly three years ago.

The digital, decentralized, deflationary asset (BTC) sold for $19,850.11 shortly after 10 AM EST, according to Coindesk data. Its previous high was set on December 17, 2017 at around $19,783. It began trading that year below $1,000 but began smashing records in the summer, fueled by intense interest from retail investors, many of whom were taken in by a Ponzi scheme called BitConnect.

UPDATE: This new record has already been broken. According to Coindesk, BTC traded at $19,920.53 Tuesday morning shortly after 6 AM EST.

After several years of correction to that parabolic bull run, Bitcoin markets have seen high volatility in 2020 ‚Äî starting the year around $7,000, crashing below $5,000 at the time of the stock market‚Äôs massive coronavirus selloff, then seeing an uptick in institutional investment after its ‚Äúhalving‚Äù ‚Äî a software feature which periodically cuts the growth rate of its monetary supply by half.

Less than two weeks ago, BTC‚Äôs market capitalization hit an all-time high; on November 19, it reached a unit price of about $18,400 that, with more than one million new Bitcoins in circulation, surpassed the network‚Äôs overall value seen during its 2017 euphoric rise.

Bitcoin‚Äôs 2020 bull run has been fueled less by everyday investors and more by financial institutions, with firms such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust leading the charge. In late October, PayPal (which also owns Venmo) announced it would begin integrating Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies.

195,American Airlines to Fly 737 Max Test Flights Carrying Only Employees,['Tom Ciccotta'],"American Airlines announced over the weekend that it will charter five flights on the infamous Boeing 737 Max carrying only its own employees as part of a trial program. The FAA approved the fleet for a return to the airways in November following a 20-month hiatus that occurred after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

According to a report by View From The Wing, American Airlines is the first airline to announce that they will run test flights with Boeing‚Äôs 737 Max fleet to ensure their safety. The fleet was grounded by aviation authorities around the globe after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

American Airlines announced in a statement that it will be flying five 737 Max flights without commercial passengers prior to their official reintroduction into the airline‚Äôs aircraft inventory.

‚ÄúWe know that restoring our customers‚Äô confidence in the 737 MAX starts with ensuring our own team members are comfortable,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why, leading up to the aircraft‚Äôs return to scheduled service Dec. 29, we‚Äôll operate five 737 MAX flights, exclusively for team members.‚Äù

The flights are scheduled to take place between December 3 and December 17. The test flights will depart from Dallas, Miami, and New York City‚Äôs LaGuardia airport. Pilots will be required to participate in simulator training at facilities in Dallas and Miami. The training will reportedly simulate various scenarios, including the MCAS system failure that led to the two fatal crashes.

American Airlines also announced that they intend to have all of their pilots trained on the operation and safety features of the refreshed 737 Max fleet by the end of March 2021.

196,PolitiFact Admits Bogus Facebook Fact Check After Candace Owens Challenges ‚ÄòFalse‚Äô Rating,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Facebook ‚Äúfact-checker‚Äù PolitiFact was forced to issue a correction after conservative commentator Candace Owens challenged the ‚Äúfalse‚Äù rating tacked on to a recent video she posted about former Vice President Joe Biden.

‚ÄúCorrection: PolitiFact originally labeled this video false in our capacity as a third-party fact-checker for Facebook,‚Äù PolitiFact announced last week.

‚ÄúOn Nov. 20, an appeal to that decision was made on behalf of Ms. Owens. PolitiFact approved the appeal on Nov. 20, determined that a correction was appropriate, and removed the false rating,‚Äù the statement added.

‚ÄúAnybody who understands politics, who passed a basic level of civics knows that right now, in this moment, Joe Biden is literally and legally not the president-elect,‚Äù said Owens in her video that was falsely ‚Äúfact-checked‚Äù by PolitiFact.

‚ÄúThis information cannot be fact-checked, because that is the truth, so they cannot take that off, they cannot censor that. It is a fact,‚Äù continued Owens in her video.

In August, Owens announced that she would be suing Facebook over its ‚Äúblatant censorship‚Äù after the social media platform demonetized her page following her comments about senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) swearing into congress in 2017 as an ‚ÄúIndian-American.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am SO EXCITED that we get to watch [Kamala Harris], who swore into congress as an ‚ÄòIndian-American‚Äô, now play the ‚ÄòI‚Äôm a black a woman‚Äô card all the way until November,‚Äù Owens had quipped on social media. ‚ÄúFun times!‚Äù

At the time, Owens told Breitbart News that Big Tech ‚Äúcensorship issue is real and we haven‚Äôt done enough to fight it as conservatives.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll they [fact checkers] have to do is find one opposite opinion, and they can give you a false rating,‚Äù Owens explained. ‚ÄúYou have to send a legal letter every time to get it reversed.‚Äù

Owens took to Twitter on Saturday to celebrate her first victory in the case against the social media giant.

‚ÄúWeeks ago, @Facebook censored a post of mine which truthfully stated that @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect. So I got lawyers involved. Conclusion? @PolitiFact uncensored the post & admitted that they LIED by rating my post false. The fact-checkers are lying for Democrats,‚Äù tweeted Owens.

At 8 Months pregnant, I unfortunately cannot fight on the ground alongside patriots like I am used to, but I am taking every measure to fight these communists in the court room.

Owens also said that she has retained lawyers, including attorney Todd McMurtry, who was on the legal team representing former Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann.

‚ÄúIt is time to fact-check the fact-checkers,‚Äù said Owens. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to put these suckers through discovery and figure out what the relationship is that they have with Facebook.‚Äù

The conservative firebrand added that she has also launched a website called ‚ÄúFact-Check Zuck,‚Äù which people can visit to help support her legal efforts in taking on Facebook‚Äôs fact-checkers.

‚ÄúOur freedoms are being stripped away.

197,Wikipedia Blacklists Newsmax Following Post-Election Popularity Boost,['T.D. Adler'],"Newsmax has seen growing audiences at its online and televised news platforms since the disputed 2020 Presidential election amid President Donald Trump‚Äôs criticism of other conservative media coverage. After a Wikipedia editor suggested having the outlet treated as reliable, other editors responded by having Newsmax banned from use as a source for factual claims instead, partly citing its coverage of election fraud allegations, making it the latest conservative outlet banned on Wikipedia in an ongoing purge.

Audience growth for Newsmax accelerated this month as conservative media audiences turn against more establishment organs such as Fox News over their coverage of the disputed nature of the 2020 election. Fox and other establishment outlets called the election for former Vice President Joe Biden even as President Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign pursues legal challenges over alleged voting improprieties. Trump has responded by attacking Fox and encouraging a switch to Newsmax or One America News. As Newsmax seeks to capitalize on this interest, Fox reportedly has sought to stifle them by blacklisting guests who appear on the competitor.

Due to the recent surge in popularity, one editor started a discussion arguing Newsmax‚Äôs reliability should be upgraded from its then-unclear status. Within minutes an editor responded with an inflammatory rant and instead called for Newsmax to be ‚Äúdeprecated‚Äù as a source, referring to outlets prohibited from use as sources for factual claims. The only cited evidence for Newsmax being unreliable was a report by the left-wing Media Matters group about a Newsmax-associated newsletter that inadvertently published anti-vaccine marketing material in an e-mail to subscribers.

Shortly afterward, editor Paul Lee also called for banning Newsmax as a source. Lee has regularly participated in discussions pushing for bans on conservative media outlets and is also the primary author of the article on the Steele dossier, which informed the debunked hoax claiming Trump colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 election, where material is slanted in favor of treating the discredited document as reliable. As more mostly left-wing editors weighed in to call for a ban over the following hours, the discussion was changed to a formal ban discussion.

Editors ‚ÄúAquillion‚Äù and ‚ÄúMastCell‚Äù made the most influential comments calling for banning Newsmax. Both editors are known for advancing left-wing agendas on Wikipedia, MastCell being an administrator with special privileges on the site. In each of their comments, they cited studies and reports they claimed showed ‚Äúreliable‚Äù sources considered Newsmax to be an egregiously unreliable source. Under Wikipedia‚Äôs reliable sourcing and verifiability policies, the quality of any source is generally judged based on what competing sources report about it.

One study they both cited mentioned Newsmax spreading a claim later found to be false, but the study also noted outlets considered reliable on Wikipedia, such as BuzzFeed News and the left-wing New Republic, had spread the claim. Another study they each cited credited Newsmax with popularizing the term ‚Äúanchor baby‚Äù in political discourse about immigration, but there was no suggestion the outlet reported anything inaccurate. They each also cited a study listing Newsmax as a ‚Äújunk news source‚Äù yet the study labeled Mediaite and New York Daily News the same way, both sources considered reliable on Wikipedia.

Aquillion separately cited a study calling Newsmax a ‚Äúmisinformation source‚Äù yet the study also labeled Huffington Post one as well, though the outlet is considered generally reliable on Wikipedia save mixed views on its politics coverage. MastCell cited news articles from CNN and the left-wing Guardian reporting Newsmax‚Äôs willingness to cover election fraud claims, but CNN never accused Newsmax of reporting false information and the Guardian only criticized a host‚Äôs opinion commentary for minor inaccuracies. Wall Street Journal coverage of a distribution network displaying Russian state-owned RT articles on Newsmax web pages was also cited, though the RT articles were not republished content and Newsmax was unaware RT was included.

MastCell also cited a Daily Beast article reporting Newsmax was one of several outlets that included opinion pieces from a network of fabricated individuals who backed the agenda of the United Arab Emirates. As with other cases, outlets considered reliable on Wikipedia such as the Jerusalem Post and South China Morning Post, were also fooled by the network. The same article was cited to support declaring the Post-Millennial unreliable, alongside false smears from Antifa of Andy Ngo, an editor for the outlet.

In the ban discussion, editors eagerly cited MastCell and Aquillion‚Äôs votes in support of their own. However, several editors pointed out the various flaws with the sources they cited, including one editor who still voted to declare Newsmax unreliable. Some editors did also vote for treating the outlet as reliable, while others challenged ban arguments without voting. Despite the issues with ban arguments, predominantly left-wing editors supporting Newsmax being banned from use as a source for factual claims overwhelmed the discussion and it was closed in favor of a ban in just over a week.

Contrasted with the treatment of the Newsmax discussion, which was closed in an accelerated procedure as most such discussions stay open a month, more left-leaning outlets such as CNN and MSNBC have had discussions about merely discouraging their use for political content shut down within a day in favor of the outlets even as editors began presenting evidence of past misconduct. Those discussions came after Fox News was discouraged as a source for political content.

Wikipedia sourcing policies have been routinely used against conservative media with Breitbart News among outlets subjected to a similar ban as Newsmax. Site owners often praise the decisions, alongside corporate media, as countering ‚Äúfake news‚Äù online in keeping with a strategy proposed to Wikipedia‚Äôs owners by a public relations firm run by the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs Head of Communications. This has led to Wikipedia being relied on by Big Tech. Analyses of Wikipedia sourcing show the site‚Äôs top sources are often left-wing media and American politician articles mostly used left-wing sources. Other studies and analyses further corroborate Wikipedia‚Äôs left-wing bias, which has been criticized by the site‚Äôs own co-founder and includes supporting Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and the Biden campaign.

198,Report: Apple May Remove the iPhone‚Äôs Charging Port,['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report states that following Apple‚Äôs iPhone 12 naming standards, it‚Äôs possible that the company‚Äôs iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max phones may not feature a charging port whatsoever.

CNET reports that tech industry rumors suggest that tech giant Apple is planning to kill its proprietary Lightning Port on future iPhones, favoring a completely portless design. One recent indication that this may be the case is the introduction of Apple‚Äôs MagSafe charger on the iPhone 12.

The MagSafe wireless charging system uses an embedded array of magnets in a puck that snaps onto the iPhone 12. To charge the iPhone 12, place it on the circular charging pad and wait for the charging indicator on the screen to confirm that it is connected. This eliminates the need for a Lightning charging cable.

CNET claims that with the addition of the MagSafe charger, a wireless future for the iPhone seems inevitable and offers a glimpse into Apple‚Äôs vision of a cord-free iPhone accessory ecosystem. Tuong Huy Nguyen, a senior principal analyst at Gartner, commented: ‚ÄúWireless technologies have reached a level of maturity where a portless device is much more viable than it‚Äôs ever been.‚Äù

Apple has been pushing for wireless alternatives for certain functions for some time. The company introduced AirDrop and cloud for data transferring and released its wireless earbuds, the Apple AirPods, in 2016.

Research Manager Will Wong at IDC‚Äôs Asia Pacific commented: ‚ÄúA smartphone is a device with limited space for all the components, but it will also be important for the smartphone makers to provide better or more functions to stay competitive. Thus, a portless phone is likely to be an unavoidable trend.‚Äù

199,Report: Activists Cheer as Tech Workers Flee San Francisco,['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report from NBC News suggests that many residents in the San Francisco Bay Area are happy to see the tech giants that made the area so popular move to cities such as Denver, Colorado, and Austin, Texas.

NBC News reports in an article titled ‚Äú‚ÄòGood riddance‚Äô: Tech‚Äôs flight from San Francisco is a relief to some advocates,‚Äù that not everyone living in the San Francisco area is a huge fan of the Silicon Valley tech giants that have operated in the region for years.

The article focuses on Chirag Bhakta, a San Francisco native and tenant organizer for the affordable house nonprofit Mission Housing. When he heard that many tech firms were leaving the area, his response was ‚Äúgood riddance.‚Äù

NBC News writes:

He [Bhakta] said the sudden departure of many tech workers and executives ‚Äî often to less expensive, rural areas where they can telecommute during the coronavirus pandemic ‚Äî reveals that their relationship with San Francisco was ‚Äútransactional‚Äù all along. ‚ÄúThey used their capital to radically shift the makeup of poor, working-class communities,‚Äù Bhakta said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre left with ‚Äòfor sale‚Äô signs and price points that are still out of reach for most people.‚Äù Many urban centers have seen residents move out in large numbers since the start of stay-at-home orders in March, but the shift has been especiallydramatic for San Francisco, a city that was already experiencing rapid change because of the tech industry. Software engineers, CEOs and venture capitalists have chosen to jump from the Bay Area to places such as Denver, Miami and Austin, Texas, citing housing costs, California‚Äôs relatively high income tax and the Bay Area‚Äôs general resistance to rapid growth and change.

John Elberling, executive director of Todco, an affordable housing nonprofit that operates in the South of Market neighborhood, commented: ‚ÄúThe motivation got to this get-rich-quick attitude. And that isn‚Äôt what our city is about. You can make a lot of money here, obviously, but that‚Äôs not the persona of San Francisco.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúIf all you care about is money, I suggest you go to Texas.‚Äù

200,FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Announces Plans to Step Down in January,['Allum Bokhari'],"Ajit Pai, chairman of the FCC, has announced he will step down from the position on January 20, 2021.

Pai was appointed chairman of the FCC by President Trump in 2017. His most high-profile decision, ending Obama‚Äôs Title II restrictions on internet service providers (misleadingly branded ‚Äúnet neutrality‚Äù by Democrats), led to wild predictions from liberals and activist groups about the end of the ‚Äúinternet as we know it.‚Äù These predictions did not come to pass.

Pai frequently criticized leftist Big Tech platforms for eroding free speech on the internet, and was preparing to move forward on President Trump‚Äôs executive order on social media censorship. With Pai now stepping down in January, this process is unlikely to continue.

In a statement, Pai said:

It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve at the Federal Communications Commission, including as Chairman of the FCC over the past four years. I am grateful to President Trump for giving me the opportunity to lead the agency in 2017, to President Obama for appointing me as a Commissioner in 2012, and to Senate Majority Leader McConnell and the Senate for twice confirming me. To be the first Asian-American to chair the FCC has been a particular privilege. As I often say: only in America. I also deeply appreciate the chance to have worked alongside the FCC‚Äôs talented staff. They are the agency‚Äôs best assets, and they have performed heroically, especially during the pandemic. It‚Äôs also been an honor to work with my fellow Commissioners to execute a strong and broad agenda. Together, we‚Äôve delivered for the American people over the past four years: closing the digital divide; promoting innovation and competition, from 5G on the ground to broadband from space; protecting consumers; and advancing public safety. And this FCC has not shied away from making tough choices. As a result, our nation‚Äôs communications networks are now faster, stronger, and more widely deployed than ever before. I am proud of how productive this Commission has been, from commencing five spectrum auctions and two rural broadband reverse auctions in four years, to opening 1,245 megahertz of mid-band spectrum for unlicensed use, to adopting more than 25 orders through our Modernization of Media Regulation Initiative, to aggressively protecting our communications networks from national security threats at home and abroad, to designating 988 as the three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, and much, much more. I‚Äôm also proud of the reforms we have instituted to make the agency more accountable to the American people. In particular, for the first time ever, we‚Äôve made public drafts of the proposals and orders slated for a vote three weeks before the agency‚Äôs monthly meetings, making this the most transparent FCC in history. Last but not least, I want to thank my family for all they have done to enable me to serve at the agency. The public service of one generally results from the private sacrifice of many, and I‚Äôm grateful for their love and support.

Breitbart News will continue to report on the FCC and free speech online.

201,Pennsylvania Elementary School Principal Claims She Was Fired over Conservative Facebook Memes,['Tom Ciccotta'],"An elementary school principal in Pennsylvania claims she was fired over a series of conservative Facebook posts. Amy Sacks was removed in July from her position as principal of Evergreen Elementary School in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. According to her lawyer, ‚ÄúLike millions of Americans over the last year Amy posted political memes opposing Joe Biden and other Democrats, while supporting the police and Republican candidates, on her private Facebook account.‚Äù

According to a report by the College Fix, former Evergreen Elementary School Principal Amy Sacks was terminated from her position after one of her Facebook posts was criticized by a member of the community. Now, Sacks is suing her former employer, alleging a violation of her First Amendment rights.

‚ÄúDue to Covid, we‚Äôre gonna need people to riot from home and destroy your own shit,‚Äù one of Sacks‚Äô posts read. Another meme posted by Sacks suggested that congressional leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) are ‚Äúprofessional looters.‚Äù

Sacks says that the district‚Äôs superintendent eventually told her that she was terminated because her Facebook posts were ‚Äúoffensive, unacceptable, ‚Äúunprofessional,‚Äù and ‚Äúracist.‚Äù The superintendent said that she had been made aware of Sacks‚Äô Facebook posts after being notified by an angry parent.

In a statement, Sacks‚Äô attorney Frances Malofiy argued that Sacks was unlawfully terminated from her position over her conservative views. Malofiy claims that the district‚Äôs decision to fire Sacks was a violation of the First Amendment.

‚ÄúLike millions of Americans over the last year Amy posted political memes opposing Joe Biden and other Democrats, while supporting the police and Republican candidates, on her private Facebook account,‚Äù the statement reads. ‚ÄúAs a public employee, Dr. Sacks‚Äô private expression is protected by the First Amendment, and also by Board Policies 320 and 321 which encourage employees to privately participate in politics and civics.‚Äù

202,UK Moves up Ban on Huawei Equipment Installations to Next Year,['Breitbart London'],"LONDON (AP) ‚Äì Wireless carriers in the U.K. won‚Äôt be allowed to install Huawei equipment in their high-speed 5G networks after September 2021, the British government said Monday, hardening its line against the Chinese technology company.

The deadline is part of a roadmap the British government is laying down to remove ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù equipment suppliers with draft legislation that aims to tighten telecommunications security requirements.

The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson in July banned Huawei from having a role in building Britain¬¥s next-generation mobile phone networks over security concerns triggered by U.S. sanctions. Britain and other European countries have started to fall in line after the U.S. lobbied allies to shun Huawei over fears its equipment could be used by China¬¥s communist rulers to facilitate electronic espionage.

Telecom operators were ordered to stop buying Huawei 5G equipment by the end of the year and have until 2027 to rip any of the company¬¥s existing gear out of their systems.

While the ban implied operators would have to stop installing Huawei gear, the latest announcement spells out the deadline clearly ‚Äì making it harder for them to stockpile equipment.

Boris Johnson Should ‚ÄòReconsider‚Äô Huawei Ban Following Trump ‚ÄòDefeat‚Äô, Threatens Chinese Tech Giant https://t.co/n39DQPl7XK ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 17, 2020

Huawei declined to comment. It has previously denied the U.S. allegations and said Britain¬¥s ban was politically motivated.

‚ÄúToday I am setting out a clear path for the complete removal of high-risk vendors from our 5G networks,‚Äù Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said. ‚ÄúThis will be done through new and unprecedented powers to identify and ban telecoms equipment which poses a threat to our national security.‚Äù

The Telecommunications (Security) Bill, which is set to be debated in Parliament on Tuesday, requires tougher security standards for 5G wireless and fiber optic networks and threatens heavy fines for companies that don¬¥t comply with the rules.

The government is also setting out a strategy to diversify its telecom equipment suppliers, including a research lab and investment in open radio standards technology. Huawei has just a handful of rivals including Finland‚Äôs Nokia and Sweden‚Äôs Ericsson, raising fears that relying on so few companies to supply critical infrastructure leaves networks open to vulnerabilities.

203,Amazon Joins Your Alexa Devices Together with Your Neighbors in a ‚ÄòShared Network‚Äô HIvemind,['Lucas Nolan'],"E-commerce giant Amazon is facing a privacy backlash over its new ‚ÄúSidewalk‚Äù feature which joins together Alexa-powered smart devices within your home with those belonging to neighbors. The company claims the ‚Äúshared network‚Äù will help ‚Äúdevices work better.‚Äù One cybersecurity expert called Amazon‚Äôs new service ‚Äúdeeply problematic from a privacy perspective,‚Äù noting that ‚ÄúNo one rides on my WiFi for free, especially a giant corporation with billions of dollars.‚Äù

MSN reports that e-commerce giant Amazon is facing backlash for its new Sidewalk feature which automatically turns Alexa-powered smart devices into shared networks. Amazon customers are automatically entered into the Sidewalk program which will connect Alex devices to other nearby devices, even those owned by someone else. Users can disable the feature from their Alexa app.

The Sidewalk program uses Alexa devices including Echo and Ring video doorbells to create a ‚Äúshared network‚Äù aimed at helping ‚Äúdevices work better.‚Äù Amazon told users in a recent email that the program allows nearby devices to use a portion of a neighbor‚Äôs WiFi bandwidth so devices can have more range.

On a launch page, Amazon stated: ‚ÄúThese Bridge devices share a small portion of your internet bandwidth which is pooled together to provide these services to you and your neighbors. And when more neighbors participate, the network becomes even stronger.‚Äù

Amazon also published a research paper detailing the technology behind Sidewalk in anticipation of privacy concerns. The paper includes the steps taken by Amazon to keep users‚Äô data private and concluded that privacy was one of the ‚Äúfoundational principles‚Äù of Sidewalk‚Äôs design.

The report‚Äôs authors stated: ‚ÄúBy sharing a small portion of their home network bandwidth, neighbors give a little ‚Äì but get a lot in return.‚Äù However, many are skeptical as to whether a network system such as Sidewalk could realistically keep user data private.

Alan Woodward, a professor at the University of Surrey specializing in cybersecurity, told BBC News in an interview that Sidewalk should be an opt-in feature rather than an opt-out feature as it currently is, adding, ‚ÄúIt feels wrong not knowing what your device is connected to.‚Äù

The chief information security officer at Cyjax, Ian Thornton-Trump, told Forbes that the launch was ‚Äúdeeply problematic from a privacy perspective.‚Äù He added: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòon by default‚Äô approach is not consumer-friendly. No one rides on my WiFi for free, especially a giant corporation with billions of dollars.‚Äù

An Amazon representative confirmed in a statement that the program was automatically enabled for existing customers, stating: ‚ÄúBut well before Sidewalk launches, we will notify existing customers with eligible Bridge devices so they can consider the benefits of Sidewalk before deciding if they want to change their preferences. After all existing customers are notified, all customers setting up a Sidewalk Bridge for the first time will have the opportunity to enable Sidewalk during device setup. All customers will have the option to change their Sidewalk preferences anytime in their Alexa app or Ring Control Center settings.‚Äù

204,New Jersey Lawmakers Pass Bill to Adopt ‚ÄòSocial Justice‚Äô Education in Public Schools,['Tom Ciccotta'],"The New Jersey state legislature recently passed a bill that will install a new ‚Äúracism‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial justice‚Äù education program for students enrolled at public schools in the state. The bill will become law if it is signed by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D).

According to a report by the College Fix, a bill that was recently passed by the New Jersey state legislature may result in the adoption of state-wide educational programming on racism and social justice. The bill was drafted to supplement an existing state law that requires public schools to incorporate black history into their lesson plans.

New Jersey Assemblywoman Angela McKnight, a sponsor of the bill, said that the bill will ensure that students in the state are taught a more complete version of black history.

‚ÄúOur children will learn about Black history and not just being a slave,‚Äù McKnight said. ‚ÄúWe will know the contributions that Black people continue to do.‚Äù

One school district in the state is taking the issue into its own hands. The Cherry Hill School District announced recently that it may become the first district in the state to require students to take a black history course prior to graduation. The proposal was first introduced by students associated with the Black Lives Matter movement earlier this year. The district is reportedly working with historians from Stockton University and the University of Pennsylvania on the development of the course.

12-year-old student Ebele Azikiwe, who runs a youth organization called Rise Against Hate, told lawmakers that the proposed bill could help ease social conflict in the United States.

‚ÄúThere is so much to share, to help awaken people,‚Äù Azikwe said. ‚ÄúIf people were taught early we aren‚Äôt a threat but simply human it will make a huge difference.‚Äù",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
205,British Anti-Terrorism Army Unit Targeting Anti Vaccine Content Online,['Kurt Zindulka'],"A British army ‚Äúinformation warfare‚Äù unit has been tasked with countering so-called anti-vaccine disinformation as the UK prepares to roll out millions of vaccines.

The Defence Cultural Specialist Unit (DCSU) of the army‚Äôs 77th Brigade was founded in 2010 as a part of the UK‚Äôs efforts to combat radical Islamic propaganda during the war in Afghanistan. The unit specialises in ‚Äúbuilding an understanding of the physical, virtual and cognitive behaviours of audiences, actors and adversaries.‚Äù

Leaked documents that were reported on by The Times reveal that the secretive unit, which previously targetted al-Qaeda and the Taliban, has been tasking soldiers with monitoring the internet for coronavirus ‚Äòpropaganda‚Äô as well as the effects it is supposedly having on the minds of the British public.

A retired army brigadier, Ben Barry, who now serves on the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, told the paper that the army would likely see an increased role in fighting against coronavirus misinformation over the coming months.

The documents also revealed that starting from next month, the 77th Brigade is expected to launch an ‚Äúuplift‚Äù programme to recruit current and reserve soldiers to join the infowar operations of the DCSU.

A spokesman from the Cabinet Office said: ‚ÄúAs we edge closer to a vaccine we continue to work closely with social media companies and other organisations to anticipate and mitigate any emerging anti-vax narratives and promote authoritative sources of information.‚Äù

The Ministry of Defence denied that the counter-terrorism unit was being used to target the British public, claiming that their operations were ‚Äúnot being directed at the UK population; 77th Brigade do not, and have never, conducted any kind of action against British citizens‚Äù.

Report: National Health Service Will Use 'Sensible' Celebrities to Front Vaccines Campaign https://t.co/U1ED8lPW3i ‚Äî Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) November 30, 2020

The British government is expecting to approve coronavirus vaccines by as early as this week, with injections of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech projected to start as soon as December 2.

To coincide with the jab rollout, the government is also expected to launch a propaganda push to convince Britons to take up the vacine. The campaign will also include a ‚Äòcounter-disinformation‚Äô push led by the Cabinet Office in conjunction with the army and the GCHQ intelligence service.

Boris Johnson‚Äôs Conservative-led government has already been flagging supposed fake news about coronavirus vaccines for removal to Silicon Valley tech companies, however, there have been calls from the left-wing Labour Party to criminalise ‚Äòconspiracy theory‚Äô posts about vaccines.

The government has so far refused to rule out making the coronavirus vaccines mandatory, yet, they are reportedly considering introducing ‚Äòvaccine stamps‚Äò in passports for international travel as well as ‚Äòfreedom passes‚Äò for people to go about their daily lives with fewer restrictions.

206,Former Coinbase Employees Claim Discrimination After CEO Blasts Woke Capitalism,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Former employees of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase told the New York Times that they experienced racist and discriminatory treatment during their time with the company. The report comes just weeks following the adoption of a company policy that prohibited discussion of politics at the workplace. CEO Brian Armstrong said at the time, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission.‚Äù

According to a report by the New York Times, former employees at Coinbase are speaking out against an alleged pattern of discrimination at the company. Coinbase was founded in 2012 to serve as an exchange for emerging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The platform has since expanded to several other cryptocurrencies.

In 2018 and 2019, 15 black employees at the company reportedly complained about a pattern of racism and discrimination at the company. Alysa Butler, who resigned from Coinbase in 2019, suggested that Coinbase is worse than any other Silicon Valley company when it comes to ‚Äúdiversity.‚Äù

‚ÄúMost people of color working in tech know that there‚Äôs a diversity problem,‚Äù Butler said. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve never experienced anything like Coinbase.‚Äù

Ruby Bhattacharya, a former recruiter for Coinbase, claims that her former colleagues ostracized her over her sexuality and race. ‚ÄúI was told I don‚Äôt have the right brain for this,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt was constant condescension.‚Äù

Breitbart News reported in October that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told employees that they would not be permitted to discuss politics at the workplace. Armstrong was criticized for the policy by progressive leaders in Silicon Valley.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission, because we believe impact only comes with focus,‚Äù Armstrong wrote in a blog post. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission. Even if we all agree something is a problem, we may not all agree on the solution.‚Äù

207,5 Times Studies Proved Wikipedia‚Äôs Left-Wing Bias,['T.D. Adler'],"Multiple academic studies and critical analyses of Wikipedia have pointed towards the site‚Äôs left-wing bias. The findings include its content being more left-leaning than Encyclopedia Britannica and left-leaning editors being more active and partisan than right-leaning editors. Left-wing outlets have been found to be the top-cited sources and represent most citations on articles about American politicians, and right-leaning editors have at the same time been found to be six times more likely to face sanctions.

Such studies and analyses validate criticism from the site‚Äôs co-founder, Larry Sanger, who earlier this year declared Wikipedia‚Äôs neutrality policy ‚Äúdead‚Äù due to left-wing bias on the site. Following are five studies and analyses demonstrating Wikipedia bias:

More biased than Encyclopedia Britannica

One study from Harvard Business School academics Shane Greenstein and Feng Zhu analyzed the content of Wikipedia to determine whether it showed a political bias. In the study, Greenstein and Zhu examined articles covering U.S. politics on Wikipedia and compared them to similar articles in Encyclopedia Britannica, the oldest English-language encyclopedia whose articles are written by vetted experts unlike the volunteer amateurs often editing Wikipedia pages. Using an academic method to examine bias, the researchers looked at word choices more consistent with left-wing and right-wing views respectively.

The study found that articles on Wikipedia tended to show greater left-wing bias based on this method than comparable articles in Encyclopedia Britannica. In the case of both, the study found the encyclopedias exhibited a left-wing bias. Greenstein and Zhu concluded one reason for this bias was the length of Wikipedia articles relative to Britannica. On a per-word basis, they found Wikipedia was slightly-less biased, though still found it showed a left-wing bias. They further found that bias declined the more edits an article received, with the most-biased tending to be the least edited.

Left-wing editors more active and partisan

Greenstein and Zhu published a subsequent paper with Grace Gu using these same methods to examine individual editors and their biases. Corroborating the previous study, the researchers found editors showing a left-wing bias tended to be more active and more partisan than their right-wing counterparts. However, the researchers also concluded many editors moderate their bias in editing the more they edit and thus over many years left-wing editors moved towards a more neutral stance somewhat more quickly. One flaw in the study is it excludes editors who made over 950 edits in a year, which excludes many of the site‚Äôs most active partisans.

Top-cited news outlets mainly left-wing

Wikipedia sourcing has been the subject of critical analysis as well with one instance being looking at the top-cited outlets on the site. The 2018 analysis by editor ‚ÄúSashiRolls‚Äù published at Wikipedia criticism site Wikipediocracy used Wikipedia‚Äôs internal search engine to identify how many articles cited specific sources. What the resulting data showed is that establishment left-leaning outlets such as the New York Times and BBC News, each cited in around 200,000 articles, were often the most-cited news sources. The left-wing Guardian was the third most-cited outlet with almost 100,000 articles citing the outlet. Among the top ten outlets cited in Wikipedia articles, only one was right-leaning.

Pages on American politicians mostly cite left-wing outlets

Narrowing the review of Wikipedia sourcing, one user on Wikipediocracy specifically examined the extent to which sources were used on articles about American politicians as of July of this year. The analysis looked at all articles included in the category for 21st Century American Politicians and used a public tool to pull the sources cited in those articles. Each source was then categorized based on bias determinations by both AllSides and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC), sites that publish bias ratings for news media.

What the analysis found is that articles on American politicians tended to rely on left-wing media. Based on AllSides ratings, 33,000 sources used were left-wing with 44,000 being left-wing based on MBFC ratings. Right-wing sources were shown to be more rarely used with such sources being cited less than 10,000 times according to either rating site. Centrist sources were used more often and closer to the number of times left-wing sources were used. Neither ratings site has rated all of the outlets cited on Wikipedia, while some ratings differ between the two sites.

Right-leaning editors six times more likely to be sanctioned

Connecting sourcing bias and editorial bias, two American academics analyzed bias in Wikipedia‚Äôs policy enforcement on political articles in a piece for British magazine the Critic. The academics looked at ‚Äúarbitration enforcement‚Äù cases where administrators with special privileges on the site can impose restrictions on editors under sanction regimes applied by the Arbitration Committee, often likened to a Supreme Court. Often applied by topic area, the analysis looked specifically at how sanctions were handed out in areas such as U.S. presidential politics, abortion, gun control, and race and intelligence.

The analysis showed that, in every area, those editors whose contributions favored the right-leaning perspective were more likely to be sanctioned. In some cases, the samples were not large enough, but in the area of U.S. politics cases concerning President Donald Trump, the analysis found editors favoring a pro-Trump perspective were about six times more likely to be sanctioned based on 114 cases. Examining all areas together similarly found editors favoring a right-leaning perspective were six times more likely to be sanctioned than those favoring the left-leaning perspective. The academics suggested administrative bias could explain right-leaning sources being disfavored on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia becomes widely-praised and influential

Site co-founder Larry Sanger this year examined bias in several articles when declaring Wikipedia had abandoned neutrality. He noted President Barack Obama‚Äôs article mentioned none of his Administration‚Äôs scandals, but scandals on President Trump‚Äôs page were extensively documented. The sourcing bias identified in several analyses contributes to such content bias as with articles on Antifa and Black Lives Matter. One reason for Wikipedia‚Äôs sourcing bias is right-wing media being subject to a years-long purge invoking policies on ‚Äúverifiability‚Äù and ‚Äúreliable‚Äù sourcing. Many editors cite combating ‚Äúfake news‚Äù to justify the purge, a narrative pushed by the site‚Äôs owners following advice from a Clinton-tied public relations firm.

In a communications audit by the firm Minassian Media, they noted Wikipedia was usually covered favorably, except when the site‚Äôs reliability was the subject of the story. Pushing the site as a challenge to ‚Äúopinionated news‚Äù citing the 2016 election was how the firm recommended improving Wikipedia‚Äôs reputation. The effort has been an apparent success with many corporate media outlets praising the site, even on its handling of political articles where edits favored left-wing views. Companies in Big Tech and organizations such as the World Health Organization have also seized on claims of Wikipedia‚Äôs reliability to incorporate the site into their efforts against ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù online.

Demonstrated left-wing bias indicates how harmful Wikipedia‚Äôs influence can become. Previous studies have already shown Wikipedia can shape scientific literature and economic behaviors with some studies raising whether it can influence elections. In the case of the 2020 Presidential election, articles about Hunter Biden and both former Vice President Joe Biden and current President Trump saw tens of thousands of views on Election Day, hundreds of thousands in the preceding weeks. However, articles about the Bidens were slanted in their favor due partly to widespread censorship of alleged Biden family corruption aided by restrictions against citing the right-wing outlets covering the allegations, while Trump-related articles have seen multiple smear campaigns.

T. D. Adler edited Wikipedia as The Devil‚Äôs Advocate. He was banned after privately reporting conflict of interest editing by one of the site‚Äôs administrators. Due to previous witch-hunts led by mainstream Wikipedians against their critics, Adler writes under an alias.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
208,UT San Antonio Sorority Kicks Student Out over Pro-Trump TikTok,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A University of Texas-San Antonio (UTSA) student was kicked out of her sorority over a pro-Trump TikTok post featuring a sign reading ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter.‚Äù Sorority leadership at the school told the student that language suggesting ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù is ‚Äúextremely hurtful‚Äù and ‚Äúunsisterly.‚Äù

UTSA student Jaycie Barton, a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA) sorority as well as president of the school‚Äôs Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter, posted a video supporting President Donald Trump to her TikTok account in August.

The video, an eight-second clip featuring demonstrators holding an American flag and signs reading ‚ÄúTrump 2020,‚Äù ‚ÄúAll Lives Matter,‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack the Blue,‚Äù subsequently got the student kicked out of her sorority.

On September 19, Barton received an email from UTSA ZTA‚Äôs judicial chairman, informing her that she had been charged with failing to ‚Äúcooperate in the best interest of the Fraternity,‚Äù and for conducting herself ‚Äúin a manner detrimental to her chapter and/or members of the Fraternity,‚Äù among other things.

The email went on to clarify that the charges were specifically for: ‚Äúthe statement ‚ÄòAll Lives Matter‚Äô is extremely hurtful to our sisters and is very unsisterly,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúZTA stands for Black Lives Matter and the statement ‚ÄòAll Lives Matter‚Äô goes against ZTA‚Äôs belief.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have what‚Äôs called judicial board, where you get called up when you‚Äôve done something wrong in the sorority,‚Äù explained Barton to Breitbart News, adding that a disciplinary hearing regarding her TikTok post was later held via Zoom.

During the sorority‚Äôs disciplinary hearing on September 21, one member argued that ‚ÄúZeta is trying to be more inclusive, and saying ‚Äòall lives matter‚Äô is not being very inclusive.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unsisterly and very hurtful to a lot of people,‚Äù the member added.

Barton, however, told Breitbart News that she does support black lives.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty clear that I do support black lives,‚Äù said Barton. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt understand how the sorority cannot see that the word ‚Äòall‚Äô includes everyone.‚Äù

The student added that when she initially joined the sorority, no one had made her aware that she would have to support the Marxist political organization Black Lives Matter in order to retain her membership.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt joining the sorority to be a supporter of BLM,‚Äù said Barton. ‚ÄúI joined for philanthropy, which was breast cancer education and awareness, and to work alongside our sisters that would be open to all members, regardless of their political opinions and beliefs.‚Äù

Following the sorority‚Äôs disciplinary hearing, ZTA informed Barton that she had been removed from her leadership position as Risk Reduction and Education chair and that she was required ‚Äúto complete a sensitivity training that involves inclusion and diversity.‚Äù

Barton said that she was later removed from the sorority completely, following another hearing regarding her TikTok post. The student added that she had requested to contact someone from the sorority‚Äôs national office regarding the matter, but that ZTA members would not allow it.

Barton told Breitbart News that as a result, she was bullied and smeared by sorority members, which she said runs counterintuitive to what ZTA claims to stand for.

‚ÄúThe sorority advocates for mental health, yet they allowed all these girls in the sorority to call me racist, flat out bullying me,‚Äù she said.

For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

‚ÄúFor purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!!‚Äù Trump posted on Twitter late Thursday.

Earlier this month, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) clashed with Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey over his company‚Äôs use of ‚Äúwarnings‚Äù on tweets related to the election.

After admitting he is not an expert on voter fraud, Dorsey said Twitter is labeling posts ‚Äúso that people have more information.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre not. You put up a page saying, quote, ‚Äòvoter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States‚Äô. That‚Äôs not linking to a broader conversation, that‚Äôs taking a disputed policy position, and you‚Äôre a publisher when you‚Äôre doing that,‚Äù Cruz said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre entitled to take a policy position, but you don‚Äôt get to pretend you‚Äôre not a publisher and get a special benefit under Section 230 as a result.‚Äù

In October, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai said the agency would ‚Äúclarify ambiguities‚Äù in a provision that grants immunity to tech companies that act as ‚Äúplatforms.‚Äù Many conservatives have argued Facebook, Twitter, Google, and others have acted more like ‚Äúpublishers‚Äù when they censor content.

‚ÄúThe beauty of Section 230 is that it protects neutral actors from liability,‚Äù Parler CEO John Matze told The Kyle Olson Show last month, confessing he is not a lawyer, but an engineer.

‚ÄúAs the founder (of Parler), I like Section 230, especially for us, because we are a neutral town square. We don‚Äôt weigh in on the content of the user,‚Äù he said, adding users ‚Äúdefine their own experience.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe problem with Section 230 is that Facebook and Twitter are already in violation of Section 230 because they‚Äôre not neutral actors, they‚Äôre acting as publishers,‚Äù Matze said.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt really need to repeal something that‚Äôs just being ignored,‚Äù he said, noting if those companies were following it, ‚Äúthey wouldn‚Äôt be creating rules to kind of kick out one ideological group.‚Äù

‚ÄúThroughout my tenure at the Federal Communications Commission, I have favored regulatory parity, transparency, and free expression,‚Äù Pai said, Breitbart News previously reported.

‚ÄúSocial media companies have a First Amendment right to free speech. But they do not have a First Amendment right to a special immunity denied to other media outlets, such as newspapers and broadcasters.‚Äù

The university‚Äôs anthropology released a statement intended to coincide with Thanksgiving that claims: ‚ÄúAs a Department, we recognize the historical and continuing impacts of colonization on Indigenous communities, their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and fully support Indigenous Sovereignty.‚Äù

According to a report by the Tampa Bay Times, the University of South Florida acknowledged this week that its campus is located on land that was once owned by ‚ÄúIndigenous communities.‚Äù

The university‚Äôs department of anthropology released a statement this week to recognize the university‚Äôs use of Native American land. The statement was released this week to bring attention to the alleged inaccuracies that the department claims are present in many historical depictions of the First Thanksgiving.

‚ÄúAs a Department, we recognize the historical and continuing impacts of colonization on Indigenous communities, their resilience in the face of colonial and state sponsored violence, and fully support Indigenous Sovereignty. We will continue work to be more accountable to the needs of American Indian and Indigenous peoples.‚Äù

The university‚Äôs spokesperson, Althea Paul, said that the university is working with the department of anthropology to honor the legacy of the Native American communities that previously occupied the land.

‚ÄúThe University of South Florida values faculty efforts focused on diversity and inclusion,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the Department of Anthropology‚Äôs initiative to acknowledge this important part of our history and pay respect to the Indigenous communities who came before us.‚Äù

Breitbart News reported this week that a professor at Portland State University told students during a lecture at Washington State University that Thanksgiving is offensive and should be replaced with a ‚ÄúNational Day of Mourning‚Äù for Indigenous people.

211,Princeton to Welcome Students Back to Campus in Spring,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Princeton University announced this week that students will return to campus for the spring semester. Most Princeton students have attended their courses remotely since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic in March. The return to campus does come with stringent rules ‚Äî students will be prohibited from hosting visitors and leaving campus.

According to a local news report, Princeton University is one of several universities that will invite students back to campus for the spring semester. Students at universities and colleges around the nation were forced to adopt virtual classroom technology in March. Now, students at Princeton will be required to comply with a variety of restrictions if they want to return to campus.

Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber explained this week that the university will utilize a robust coronavirus testing regime to mitigate the spread of the virus.

‚ÄúDuring the fall term, we cultivated strong public health norms and practices on the Princeton campus; monitored and learned from experiences with the virus at Princeton and elsewhere; and established an on-campus testing laboratory,‚Äù Eisgruber wrote in a statement. ‚ÄúIn light of that work, we have concluded that, if we test the campus population regularly, and if everyone on campus rigorously adheres to public health guidance about masking, social distancing and other practices, we can welcome a far greater number of students back to Princeton.‚Äù

The university has also adopted several strict restrictions for the spring semester. Students will be prohibited from hosting visitors and leaving campus. Additionally, students will be required to quarantine upon their arrival to campus in January.

Breitbart News reported in September that Princeton was investigated by the Department of Education after its president claimed that ‚Äúracism‚Äù was ‚Äúembedded in the structures‚Äù of the university. The Department of Education told Princeton that it was launching an investigation into the university‚Äôs practices to ensure that it was not in violation of various non-discrimination laws.

212,"Report: ‚ÄòSmart‚Äô Doorbells Sold on Amazon, eBay Filled with Security Vulnerabilities",['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report states that a number of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù doorbells featuring microphones and cameras sold on Amazon and eBay come stocked with a number of security vulnerabilities.

CyberScoop reports that the U.K.-based security company NCC Group and consumer advocacy group Which? have discovered major security vulnerabilities in 11 ‚Äúsmart‚Äù doorbells sold on Amazon and eBay. One major flaw could allow a remote attacker to break into the owner‚Äôs wireless network by swiping login credentials while another critical bug could enable attackers to intercept and manipulate data on the network.

The investigation of the devices found that many doorbells made by obscure vendors that received top reviews on Amazon and eBay were extremely vulnerable. Researchers believe that many of the devices store sensitive data including location data and audio and video captured by the doorbell‚Äôs camera on insecure servers. One device made by a company named Victure sent a user‚Äôs wireless name and password, completely unencrypted, to servers in China, researchers reported.

Amazon said in a statement that it requires products sold on its site to be compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that it has tools to detect and prevent ‚Äúunsafe or non-compliant products from being listed in our stores.‚Äù eBay said that it takes down listings that violate its safety standards but that the devices flagged by researchers did not meet the company‚Äôs threshold. A spokesperson for the doorbell manufacturer Victure denied that the company sent usernames and passwords to Chinese servers.

Matt Lewis, the research director of the project, said that his team‚Äôs findings indicate ‚Äúa wider culture that favors shortcuts over security in the manufacturing process.‚Äù Other research found that home-networking devices ranging from routers to webcams also suffer from major security vulnerabilities.

Last week, the U.S. Congress passed long-awaited legislation that would set security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) vendors that contract with the U.S. government.

213,Columbia Prof: Rockefeller Christmas Tree Should be Canceled for the ‚ÄòToxic Relationship‚Äô of ‚ÄòNature and Capitalism‚Äô,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A professor at Columbia University says that the iconic Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree should be ‚Äúcanceled,‚Äù because it represents a ‚Äútoxic relationship shared between nature and capitalism.‚Äù

‚ÄúIts appearance was a metaphor for this year of pandemic, a slapdash coup attempt, and a general drubbing of American exceptionalism.,‚Äù wrote professor Brian Kahn of the unveiling of this year‚Äôs Rockefeller Christmas tree in an op-ed published in Gizmodo.

The professor went on to call the tradition a ‚Äútoxic‚Äù symbol of how nature is treated, adding that this year‚Äôs Norway spruce ‚Äúshould be the last‚Äù if we want to see any ‚Äújustice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis year‚Äôs tree is also perfectly poised to reflect something more than our national mood: It reflects the absolutely toxic relationship we have with the natural world and the need to rapidly reverse course,‚Äù said Kahn. ‚ÄúIf this year‚Äôs tree sees any justice, it‚Äôs that it should be the last.‚Äù

Kahn then claimed that ‚Äúeverything about this tree tells a piece of the story of our past century-plus relationship with nature and extractive capitalism,‚Äù and that the tree lost its ‚Äúdignity‚Äù when it was transported to Manhattan earlier this month.

‚ÄúThe tree is a Norway spruce, which, as you can likely guess from the name, is not native to the U.S. That in and of itself reflects how upended our relationship with nature is,‚Äù wrote Kahn. ‚ÄúIn its previous home, though, it had an iota of dignity lost completely once it was transported to Midtown Manhattan.‚Äù

The professor wrote that the process in cutting down the tree ‚Äî which included rescuing an owl that was found in it ‚Äî reflects how ‚Äúwe‚Äôve subjugated nature to our whims.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe Rockefeller tree was cut down in a town itself carved out of what was, more than a century ago, an old growth forest,‚Äù wrote Kahn. ‚ÄúAnd an owl was scooped up in the process of cutting down the tree and transported to New York.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll this reflects the ways in which we‚Äôve subjugated nature to our whims,‚Äù the professor continued. ‚ÄúAnd really, the evolution of the Rockefeller Center tree tradition is a very apt stand-in for that in general.‚Äù

‚ÄúEven our adorable feathered stowaway is a symbol of our toxic relationship with nature,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThe Northern saw-whet owl is currently considered a low-concern species due to human pressures and has even managed to carve a niche out in human landscapes (clearly). But the climate crisis fueled by unending growth and fossil fuels will eventually come for it, too.‚Äù

The professor concluded by acknowledging that he‚Äôll likely be called a ‚Äútree hugger‚Äù and a ‚Äútotal killjoy‚Äù for his remarks, but that he believes Americans today likely need this tree ‚Äúto feel something like normal again,‚Äù just as they did during the Great Depression.

‚ÄúI know I‚Äôll likely receive many a furious email cussing me out for being a tree hugger perpetrating the war on Christmas and a total killjoy,‚Äù wrote Kahn. ‚ÄúBut my point isn‚Äôt that we should end joy and piss on Santa. It‚Äôs that now is the perfect moment to consider what we truly value.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen I saw the Rockefeller Center tree propped up as it shed entire boughs to the cold plaza ground this year, I felt no elation,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúI just felt sad that we venerate the continued subjugation of nature at the expense of unfettered growth and consumption ‚Äî or even simply because we, like those who suffered through the Great Depression, want to feel something like normal again.‚Äù

The official account of the Google-owned video platform has not posted any tweet celebrating Thanksgiving, snubbing the holiday currently being celebrated by its millions of American users in favor a 5-tweet thread about ‚Äúunthanksgiving.‚Äù

From the thread:

For Indigenous and Native Americans, the fourth Thursday of November is dedicated to Indigenous history, activism, and resistance. It‚Äôs called Unthanksgiving. Unthanksgiving is about acknowledging, educating, and honoring centuries of Indigenous resistance. Coinciding with New England‚Äôs National Day of Mourning, Unthanksgiving activates Alcatraz Island, the site of a 19-month occupation by Bay Area Natives in 1969. For generations, Native Americans and Indigenous persons have shared their experiences, using Unthanksgiving as an opportunity for intergenerational and intercultural dialogue. Generations before have lived on these lands. Days like Unthanksgiving are opportunities for learning and understanding whose land you live on. Find out here ‚Üí https://native-land.ca Unthanksgiving is about honoring Native American and Indigenous heritage, to better understand this history.

The initial tweet in YouTube‚Äôs thread has been ‚Äúratioed,‚Äù meaning it has attracted more replies and quotes ‚Äì the vast majority of which mock or condemn the thread ‚Äì than retweets.

Google, which owns YouTube, is known for its woke left-wing culture. In 2018, Breitbart News reported on a leaked document from inside the company instructing managers to be wary of rewarding employees for adhering to the values of ‚Äúwhite male dominant culture.‚Äù

Beyond left-wing virtue signaling, Google has also engaged in election interference. Six months before the election, following a major change to its core search algorithm, clicks and impressions to Breitbart News from Google searches for ‚ÄúJoe Biden,‚Äù dropped to zero and stayed there through election day.

Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia. Especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County. This scheme and artifice to defraud affected tens of thousands of votes in Georgia alone and ‚Äúrigged‚Äù the election in Georgia for Joe Biden. ‚Ä¶ [V]ideo from the State Farm Arena in Fulton County shows that on November 3rd after the polls closed, election workers falsely claimed a water leak required the facility to close.

216,"Study: Smartphone Notifications Don‚Äôt Distract Us, We Distract Ourselves",['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent study has found that users initiate 89 percent of all smartphone interactions on their own, with only 11 percent being initiated by a notification. These results go against the conventional wisdom that the mountain of notifications generated on the average person‚Äôs phone every day distracts us from other tasks.

Psych News Daily reports that a recent study published in the journal Computers in Human Behavior on November 21 claims that 89 percent of smartphone interactions are initiated by users while only 11 percent are initiated by a notification.

The study states: ‚ÄúThe perceived disruptiveness of smartphones is not mainly driven by external notifications, but by an urge of the user to interact with their phone that seems to occur in an almost automatic manner, just as a smoker would light a cigarette.‚Äù

The study followed the smartphone usage of people in the UK, Germany, and France. The average age of the subjects was 26 and just over half of the subjects were male. The study authors, Max Heitmayer and Saadi Lahlou, are both affiliated with the London School of Economics.

The subjects were equipped with a tiny camera called ‚Äúsubcams‚Äù which filmed the subject‚Äôs daily lives from a first-person perspective. The subjects recorded their behavior for a total of around five hours over a three-day period. The subjects could turn the camera off at any time and were allowed to delete any footage they wished.

The end result was around 200 hours of footage of user behavior in real-world environments. This totaled around 1,130 smartphone interactions that the researchers could analyze. The study found that the time between smartphone interactions was on average 291 seconds, meaning users were checking their phones around once every five minutes.

The researchers noted that many users felt compelled to check their devices even when they had notifications switched off. One subject stated: ‚ÄúSeeing this has made me realize that I don‚Äôt even remember picking it up.‚Äù

Professor Elizabeth Pearce received an outpouring of praise and support after her message to her students went viral.

According to a report by Good Morning America, Professor Elizabeth Pearce of the University of Iowa went viral this week after she offered Thanksgiving meals to students that will spend the holiday on campus due to the pandemic.

In the email, Pearce said that she wanted to offer a home-cooked family dinner to students that had chosen to stay on campus over the holiday weekend.

Good morning. I know this has been a difficult time for a lot of you ‚Äî some of you have had Covid, some of you are currently in quarantine, and some of you may not be able to go home for Thanksgiving as you have family members who are socially distancing. I don‚Äôt want anyone to feel alone at Thanksgiving, or to miss out on a homecooked family dinner, so I want to invite you to share my Thanksgiving dinner. I‚Äôve talked with my kids and we would be happy to make extra portions of everything and drop it by your apartment or residence (as long as its within a 20 mile radius0. Since we‚Äôre all socially distancing we would leave it outside and not have physical contact with you.

Pearce said that she plans to prepare the meals with the help of her children, who will utilize facial coverings during meal preparation. The professor even offered students various dishes to choose from and a ‚Äúvegan option.‚Äù

I truly want you to take me up on this offer if you are in town. As I mentioned, my kids have been socially distancing and we will make the food wearing masks to reduce the likelihood of anything being spread. My youngest daughter is vegan so there‚Äôll be a vegan option. Check out the menu below. If you are socially distancing with a roommate or significant other, I‚Äôll be happy to drop off two or even three portions.

Breitbart News reported in September that the University of Iowa was forced to spend $1 million to repair damage to campus that was caused by rioters that participated in a local Black Lives Matter protest.

It's been a wild year for bitcoin , which has soared more than 175% since the end of 2019. Prices plunged below $4,000 in March as markets around the globe plummeted due to the Covid-19 economic crisis.

But bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past few months as the dollar has weakened . Crucially, the cryptocurrency has also skyrocketed into the mainstream.

Payments giantsandboth now allow their customers to buy and sell bitcoin . Money management giant Fidelity is launching a bitcoin fund for wealthy investors.itcoin futures contracts are even trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Prominent investment managers Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Mike Novogratz are bullish on bitcoin as well.

In other words, the days of bitcoin being considered just a fringe investment are over. The cryptocurrency has gone legit.

""This rally is driven by smart and institutional money and not built solely on retail over-speculation,"" said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the US at eToro, brokerage and trading firm, in an e-mail to CNN Business. ""So many more individuals and asset managers are now buying in.""

The amount of bitcoin currently in circulation is now worth more than $365 billion.

BlackRock BLK Bitcoin also got a recent boost after a top strategist at, the world's largest asset management firm, suggested that bitcoin could one day replace gold as a safe-haven currency of choice.

The epic rise in bitcoin has also fueled even more dramatic spikes in smaller cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, XRP, litecoin and Stellar as of late. That may continue.

""Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high...will likely spur a tidal wave of retail investment that pushes bitcoin much higher in short order,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant, in an e-mail to CNN Business.

""However, it is unlikely that this inflow will be limited to bitcoin only,"" he added. ""The ease of access to other assets is much more straightforward than what it was during the last bull run.""",CNN,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nikola shares plunged more than 20% on the news.

The new deal replaces an agreement announced in September in which GM had planned to take an 11% stake in Nikola and supply the startup with equipment for its highly anticipated hydrogen fuel cell trucksGM had also previously said it would build Nikola's planned pickup, the Badger.

But shortly after that deal was announced, a short seller released a report leveling allegations of fraud and exaggeration against the company and it's then-chairman Trevor Milton. Nikola disputed the report.

In the wake of the allegations, GM reminded investors that it had not yet closed the deal with Nikola. The new arrangement, announced Monday morning, is still just a memorandum of understanding, not a final deal. Under this deal, GM will simply be a supplier to Nikola.

Nikola executives have said the Badger pickup would be built only through an arrangement with an outside company. The company has now said it will refund deposits potential customers had placed for the truck.

""Nikola is focusing on its core business of producing commercial zero-emission trucks,"" a Nikola spokeswoman said in an email.

The two companies will also discuss Nikola possibly using GM's Ultium battery system, which will used in GM's future electric vehicles.

Small Business Majority‚Äôs latest survey reveals that the uncertainty of whether more help will arrive has left too many small businesses on the brink of collapse.

The survey finds that without additional funding, more than 1 in 3 (35%) small business owners will not survive past the next three months. The number is even higher for small business owners of color: an astounding 41% of Black and Latino-owned businesses won‚Äôt make it through the next few months without additional financial support. And 1 in 5 small business owners report they‚Äôve considered filing for bankruptcy. These numbers have grown since our last survey was released on August 27, when 26% of small businesses reported they wouldn‚Äôt survive more than three months, and 16% reported they‚Äôve considered bankruptcy.

To make matters worse, a wave of commercial evictions and foreclosures is likely on the horizon, with 8 in 10 small business owners reporting that they are struggling to make commercial rent or mortgage payments‚Äîup 18% since late August. Slightly more business owners of color (84%) report the same. Equally troubling, 64% of all small businesses and 73% of Black and Latino-owned businesses are concerned they will have to permanently lay off employees without immediate federal relief. More than 6 in 10 Black and Latino small business owners are very concerned they will have to make permanent layoffs, and 10% have already done so.

Given these numbers, it‚Äôs clear that small businesses need more assistance in order to survive the pandemic. When asked what the number one priority should be for Congress and the White House before Election Day, small businesses ranked a comprehensive stimulus package as their top concern. Fifty-five percent ranked negotiating on a comprehensive, bipartisan stimulus package that includes small business assistance and unemployment insurance as the number one priority, followed by 29% who want to see a standalone small business relief bill, 5% who want another round of stimulus checks for some Americans and 4% who want see the Supreme Court nominee confirmed.

The need for a comprehensive relief package comes at a time when small business owners are still experiencing a significant loss in consumer confidence. Forty-five percent of small business owners rank reduced consumer demand as the top concern for their business right now. One in five of all small business owners and more than 1 in 4 minority-owned businesses (27%) rank the health and safety of themselves, their employees and their customers as their top concern. Fifteen percent of Black and Latino owned businesses are still unable to reopen their businesses.

Additionally, small business owners are concerned about the future of their healthcare. In November, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the case of California v. Texas, a case challenging the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Seventy-four percent of all small businesses and 86% of Black and Latino-owned businesses are concerned that the Supreme Court may strike down all or part of the healthcare law, including protections for individuals with preexisting conditions.

The findings of this survey paint a dire picture of what many small business owners are facing just weeks before Election Day. With no sign of an end to the health crisis in sight, small business owners are looking to Congress and the White House to provide more comprehensive relief to sustain their businesses and set our economy on a meaningful path toward recovery.

This is the fifth in a series of COVID-19 related surveys Small Business Majority has released of its network. Over time Small Business Majority has tracked the economic conditions facing small businesses, how well federal stimulus programs have served its network, the small business owners' views of proposed stimulus provisions, and other issues of importance.

It's been a wild year for bitcoin , which has soared more than 175% since the end of 2019. Prices plunged below $4,000 in March as markets around the globe plummeted due to the Covid-19 economic crisis.

But bitcoin has rallied sharply in the past few months as the dollar has weakened . Crucially, the cryptocurrency has also skyrocketed into the mainstream.

Prominent investment managers Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller and Mike Novogratz are bullish on bitcoin as well.

""This rally is driven by smart and institutional money and not built solely on retail over-speculation,"" said Guy Hirsch, managing director for the US at eToro, brokerage and trading firm, in an e-mail to CNN Business. ""So many more individuals and asset managers are now buying in.""

The amount of bitcoin currently in circulation is now worth more than $365 billion.

BlackRock BLK Bitcoin also got a recent boost after a top strategist at, the world's largest asset management firm, suggested that bitcoin could one day replace gold as a safe-haven currency of choice.

The epic rise in bitcoin has also fueled even more dramatic spikes in smaller cryptocurrencies such as ethereum, XRP, litecoin and Stellar as of late. That may continue.

""Bitcoin hitting a new all-time high...will likely spur a tidal wave of retail investment that pushes bitcoin much higher in short order,"" said Denis Vinokourov, head of research at digital assets prime broker Bequant, in an e-mail to CNN Business.

""However, it is unlikely that this inflow will be limited to bitcoin only,"" he added. ""The ease of access to other assets is much more straightforward than what it was during the last bull run.""",CNN,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
235,Nikola shares fall after GM scraps Badger deal and drops equity stake,[],"(CNN) General Motors is giving up its equity stake in Nikola Motors and scrapping plans to build the electric truck maker's Badger pickup as part of a new, scaled-back deal between the companies.

Nikola shares plunged more than 20% on the news.

The new deal replaces an agreement announced in September in which GM had planned to take an 11% stake in Nikola and supply the startup with equipment for its highly anticipated hydrogen fuel cell trucksGM had also previously said it would build Nikola's planned pickup, the Badger.

But shortly after that deal was announced, a short seller released a report leveling allegations of fraud and exaggeration against the company and it's then-chairman Trevor Milton. Nikola disputed the report.

In the wake of the allegations, GM reminded investors that it had not yet closed the deal with Nikola. The new arrangement, announced Monday morning, is still just a memorandum of understanding, not a final deal. Under this deal, GM will simply be a supplier to Nikola.

Nikola executives have said the Badger pickup would be built only through an arrangement with an outside company. The company has now said it will refund deposits potential customers had placed for the truck.

""Nikola is focusing on its core business of producing commercial zero-emission trucks,"" a Nikola spokeswoman said in an email.

The two companies will also discuss Nikola possibly using GM's Ultium battery system, which will used in GM's future electric vehicles.

237,Mortgage rates have never been this low,[],"Mortgage rates fell to another record low last week, for the 13th time this year.

The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.72%, according to Freddie Mac . That's the lowest level in the nearly 50 years of the mortgage giant's survey. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped to 2.28%.

""Weaker consumer spending data, which accounts for the majority of economic growth, drove mortgage rates to a new record low,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""While economic growth remains unstable, strong housing demand continues to have a domino effect on many other segments of the economy.""

The continuing low interest rates have helped to fuel a boom in the US housing market. In the third quarter Americans' mortgage debt climbed to a record high of nearly $10 trillion according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Investors had to weigh the promising news of another vaccine contender against a disappointing retail report and still-rising Covid cases , which drove down the interest rate for a 30-year loan, said George Ratiu, Realtor.com senior economist.

Home sales rose again in October, at their highest pace in 14 years, according to the National Association of Realtors.

But a record low inventory of available homes and a greater number of luxury homes sold have pushed the median home price up to a record $313,000, almost 16% more than a year ago. Total housing inventory dropped 3% from September and is down nearly 20% from a year ago.

Homes sold at a swift pace in October, with more than 7 in 10 homes sold on the market for less than a month. At the current pace of sales, it would take just 2.5 months to clear the existing inventory ‚Äî a record low.

Sales of existing homes ‚Äî which include single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops ‚Äî were up 4.3% from September and 26.6% from a year ago, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.85 million in October.

At that price, a family would need to pay $1,059 for a monthly mortgage payment and would need to earn $50,819 a year to afford it.

Home prices grew four times as fast as median family income, which increased at a rate of 3%.

The median sale prices of existing single-family homes rose from a year ago in all 181 metro areas measured in the report, and 65% saw double-digit price gains.

Prices are rising largely due to the combination of low mortgage rates that are attracting buyers, and a limited supply of available homes to buy.

240,How a vaccine could upend real estate markets -- again,[],"In just a matter of months the coronavirus pandemic dramatically changed the landscape of the housing market, especially in big cities. But now news of a promising vaccine could turn the market on its head again.

Nationally, home prices have never been higher , driven up as surging demand due to record low mortgage rates comes up against historically low inventory of homes for sale.

But the most expensive urban areas have been experiencing the opposite problem. Cities like New York and San Francisco have seen higher vacancy rates and lower rents and sale prices as many people, untethered from office jobs, retreated to the suburbs and less densely populated areas.

But with potential vaccines on the horizon, real estate in big cities could see a turnaround.

""It's not going to be a light switch,"" said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraiser and consultant in New York City. ""But the news is starting to get people to be hopeful and think about returning to the city. Because right now, without a vaccine, it is status quo.""

While widespread vaccination is still a ways off , the news alone is a good sign that real estate in cities will continue to recover as the prospect of vaccines becomes more realistic, said Richard Smith, chairman and executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a nonprofit that studies recurring patterns in economics, social sciences and nature.

""Sometimes it is when the news gets less bad that you get your biggest gains,"" he said.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs), investments backed by real estate, that had cratered when the pandemic broke out, have already recovered some of their losses and moved higher on the vaccine news.

Here's what the vaccine could mean for renters and home buyers.

Will people return to cities?

The more a vaccine brings life closer to ""normal,"" the more city real estate markets will change, said Miller.

""Once the vaccine is out and the population begins seeing schools reliably open and the big companies bringing people back in, that's where it snowballs,"" he said. ""Then people can make plans around it.""

In Manhattan, the rental market will come back first, he said, because that activity has fallen the most and there is a lower bar to entry. But with rental inventory currently triple what it was a year ago, don't expect rents to go up soon.

The Manhattan rental market remains historically weak. Last month saw a record-high number of apartments available to rent and a record-high share of rental apartments leased with concessions like one or two months free rent, according to brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.

The vacancy rate in Manhattan is at a new all-time high of 6.14%. That's caused record price declines in rents. The median rent for a one bedroom in Manhattan in October, for example, was $3,064 a month, down 4.1% from September and down 14.8% from a year ago.

""There has been a precipitous drop in the cost of a rental and the expectation is that there is still more of that ahead, until the inventory is eaten up,"" said Miller. ""There is still a lot of runway ahead. We'll be well into 2021 and a vaccine until we get into an uptick in pricing.""

For those looking to buy, purchasing a home in New York will be more attractive when a vaccine makes all the things a city has to offer possible again, Miller said, including easy access to dining, theater, concerts and events.

""The first thing that has to happen in terms of really accelerating the re-adoption of city life in the post-pandemic world, is going to be when companies, especially the Fortune 500 companies as leaders, start to bring people back to work,"" he said.

Buyers won't leave the suburbs behind

The uncertainty of this past year has left a mark on buyers, particularly those with higher incomes who can afford a second home near the city as a refuge that requires no planes or planning, said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

""The virus made the home very important,"" said Herman. ""Working from home will be here to stay, in some way. It won't be only working from home, but some combination of at home and the office.""

That has created wish lists for new homes that include outdoor space and offices and it has expanded locations for buyers, lengthening the commuting tether between home and office, she said.

Strong demand in the suburbs and resort communities near cities will continue, she said. Even though many suburban areas around New York passed their pandemic peak in the summer, in many areas sales are still above levels seen a year ago.

""People have gotten used to working from home and are comfortable living farther from the city,"" she said. ""That won't change with a vaccine. Second homes will continue to be a booming market nationally.""

Will mortgage rates stay low?

Mortgage interest rates hit a 12th all-time low heading into November, and some economists say even lower rates may be ahead. Others, however, say the vaccine news could reverse the downward trend.

""While rates are always unpredictable, sustained record lows are looking less likely in light of recent events,"" said Brendan Phillips, a capital markets analyst at Better.com, an online lender. ""Rates jumped when pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced its Covid-19 vaccine had shown 90% efficacy in trials .""

Goldman Sachs analysts pointed to the encouraging progress of vaccine research as a reason to think the economy may sustain a ""V-shaped"" recovery, bouncing back quickly to pre-pandemic levels. Other economists say that the ability of Congress to finally pass a stimulus package will also affect the speed of the country's recovery from the current recession.

""Good news for the economy, though, usually means higher rates,"" said Phillips.",CNN,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

250,"Et tu, Barr? Attorney General Says DOJ Hasn‚Äôt Found Evidence of Fraud That Would ‚ÄúChange Election Outcome‚Äù",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

After weeks of silence, Attorney General William Barr has come out stating the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security haven‚Äôt seen any evidence of election fraud that would have changed the election outcome.

In a statement to the AP on Tuesday, Barr said the DOJ and DHS haven‚Äôt seen fraud on a scale big enough to change the Nov. 3 presidential election.

‚ÄúTo date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,‚Äù Barr said.

Barr claimed that the only mechanism capable of skewing an election would be compromised voting machines, but ‚Äúso far‚Äù haven‚Äôt been able to substantiate that.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven‚Äôt seen anything to substantiate that,‚Äù Barr said.

Barr then explained that many of the election fraud allegations should be handled in civil lawsuits where ‚Äútop-down audits‚Äù could be conducted, because many of those allegations are not ‚Äúsystemic‚Äù and therefore don‚Äôt fall under the DOJ‚Äôs purview.

From the AP:

He said people were confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits. He said such a remedy for those complaints would be a top-down audit conducted by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don‚Äôt like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and ‚Äòinvestigate,‚Äô‚Äù Barr said. He said first of all there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate. ‚ÄúMost claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations. And those have been run down; they are being run down,‚Äù Barr said. ‚ÄúSome have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.‚Äù

Barr‚Äôs long-awaited remarks come days after President Trump lambasted the DOJ and FBI for being ‚Äúmissing in action‚Äù as many instances of election fraud evidence, backed by affidavits, are being revealed by the day.

‚ÄúYou would think if you‚Äôre in the FBI or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at,‚Äù Trump said Sunday. ‚ÄúWhere are they? I‚Äôve not seen anything.‚Äù

So far, Trump‚Äôs legal team has spearheaded bombshell hearings in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan outlining stunning instances of voter irregularities.

Trump‚Äôs legal team responded to Barr‚Äôs remarks, arguing there hasn‚Äôt even been a ‚Äúsemblance‚Äù of a DOJ investigation into the many allegations by poll workers and IT experts they‚Äôve brought forward.

‚ÄúWith all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn‚Äôt been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud. As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The Justice Department also hasn‚Äôt audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth,‚Äù Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement.

AG William Barr tells AP Justice Department has 'not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.' https://t.co/B7QHytWKlj Trump legal team responds: pic.twitter.com/vjRCbeaRg8 ‚Äî Byron York (@ByronYork) December 1, 2020

252,Firm That Owns Dominion Voting Systems Received $400 Million From Swiss Bank Account Funded by Communist Chinese Gov & Companies Before Election,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

An investigation into SEC filings has revealed that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

The investigation centers on Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.

Dominion Voting Systems operates voting machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election night.

‚ÄúOn Oct 8, 2020, Staple Street Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400,000,000 with the Sales Compensation Recipient identified as UBS Securities,‚Äù states the investigation, which also notes that another payment of $200,000,000 was received in December 2014.

‚ÄúUBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co LTD, a Chinese Investment Bank. The remaining 75% of UBS Securities CO LTD is owned by the Chinese government,‚Äù states the report.

The overall owners of UBS Securities Co LTD are;

‚Äì Beijing Guoxiang (33%)

‚Äì UBS (24.99%)

‚Äì Guangdong Comm. Group [zh] (14.01%)

‚Äì China Guodian (14%)

‚Äì COFCO Group (14%)

Aside from UBS, the other four owners of UBS Securities are all Communist Chinese front groups.

Beijing Guoxiang is a state owned asset.

Guangdong Comm. Group 100% stakeholder is the Guangdong Provincial Government.

China Guodian is state owned enterprise administered for the SASAC for the state Council

COFCO Group is a state owned enterprise under the direct supervision of the SASAC.

SASAC The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) is a special commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, directly under the State Council.

The revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election to help Joe Biden.

Other connections between Dominion Voting Systems and the Chinese government have also emerged in recent weeks, including the company‚Äôs Core Infrastructure Manager of Information Technology, Andy Huang, who previously worked for China Telecom, which is ‚Äúwholly run by the Chinese government,‚Äù reported the National Pulse.

Kapoor responded to the controversy on Monday by retweeting a clip of the episode along with two laughing emojis.

Speaking to Huffpost.com, Kapoor dismissed allegations he was commissioned to spread a message, but said the controversy works to his advantage in terms of exposure.

More from HuffPost.com:

‚ÄúIt was a fraction in time and yet it has become an integral part of my identity as an immigrant in America,‚Äù he shared via email, referencing his immigration from India in 2014. He also added that ever since COVID-19 came into the zeitgeist, ‚Äúpeople have been reaching out calling me an imposter who was ‚Äòpaid‚Äô by the government to spread a message.‚Äù

He says he finds humor ‚Äúin such claims,‚Äù a feeling he echoed on Twitter with his crying-laughing emoji in response to the TikTok of his design.

Kapoor, who will be launching his very first collection in February 2021, also told HuffPost that it‚Äôs been ‚Äúvery interesting to see how fate plays itself out‚Äù and truly ‚Äúhad no idea that the mask thing would blow up.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt the end of the day whatever gets people talking about you or your work is worth it,‚Äù he said.

Akron, OH: Today, Tom Zawistowski, President of the TEA Party affiliated We the People Convention (WTPC) and Executive Director of the Portage County TEA Party, published a full page ad in the Washington Times newspaper demanding that President Trump Invoke limited Martial law in order to allow the U.S. Military to oversee a new free and fair federal election if Legislators, Courts and the Congress do not follow the Constitution.

Zawistowski said, ‚ÄúWe wanted to express our concerns to the President, to the legislators, courts and Congress that We the People will NOT cede our exclusive Constitutional right to elect our Representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, Governors, Secretary‚Äôs of State, Congress, corrupt election officials and local politicians, the corrupt media ‚Äì or Leftist threats of violence!

Without full confidence that our courts or Congress will indeed follow the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and defend our electoral process, the ad calls upon President Trump, like Lincoln, to exercise the Extraordinary Powers of his office and declare limited Martial Law to temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections in order to have the military implement a national re-vote that reflects the true will of the people.

Here is the full text of the Ad:

Exercising Extraordinary Authority in Defense of Our Vote

May be Required because Martial Law is better than Civil War!

In the months following the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to preserve the Union. Many objected to Lincoln‚Äôs extraordinary use of Presidential authority, in particular his suspension of the right of ‚ÄúHabeas Corpus‚Äù. On June 12, 1863 Lincoln defended his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times. Citing Article I of the Constitution he argued: ‚ÄúOurs is a case of rebellion‚Ä¶in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that ‚Äòthe privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it‚Äô, is the provision which specifically applies to our present case.‚Äù Lincoln used the same reasoning in justifying a series of extraordinary Presidential Orders:

Lincoln ordered hundreds of Northern newspapers that spoke against him to be shut down and their owners and editors arrested.

Lincoln ordered the arrest of Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandigham for the crime of speaking out against him.

Chief Justice of the US Roger Taney ruled that Lincoln had violated the US Constitution when he illegally suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus. After hearing this Lincoln signed an arrest warrant to have the Chief Justice of the U.S. arrested.

Lincoln ordered the arrest of thousands in Maryland for the crime of ‚Äúsuspected Southern sympathies‚Äù including ordering the arrest of US Congressman Henry May from Maryland. These people were arrested and held in military prisons, without trial, some of them for years.

While some debate these measures still today, no one disagrees that Lincoln and his use of Presidential power were responsible for saving the Republic. While History, and even former President Obama, has judged Lincoln as perhaps our greatest President, few would have agreed at the time he took those actions. Then, as now, a President with courage and determination was needed to preserve the Union. Today, the current threat to our United States by the international and domestic socialist/communist left is much more serious than anything Lincoln or our nation has faced in its history ‚Äì including the civil war.

We have well-funded, armed and trained marxists in ANTIFA and BLM strategically positioned in our major cities acting openly with violence to silence opposition to their anti-American agenda. Attacking federal buildings and police, cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head, assaulting people just eating in restaurants, and burning minority-owned businesses to the ground. All with elected officials in Democrat/Socialist-controlled cities openly encouraging this planned violence against civilians and businesses. Then, to advance their cause, these socialists are acting to ‚ÄúDefund the Police,‚Äù creating chaos and suspending the rule of law that protects millions of average, and particularly minority, Americans. The results being massive increases in violent crime and deaths in our cities and the destruction of small businesses orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many funded by domestic and international communists. We are literally under attack from within!

Then there are admitted Democrat/Socialist federal officials plotting to finish gutting the US Constitution after 100 years of trying. They promise to take away critical individual rights like free speech, religious freedom and the 2nd Amendment; destroy states rights by eliminating the electoral college and more; pack the Supreme Court with activist anti-constitutionalist judges who will make law from the bench; give the right to vote to tens of millions of non-Americans; and open our borders to more illegals which will reduce wages. No one voted for these things that were hidden from the majority of Americans by the corrupt media. Not only do we have corrupt media, like in Lincoln‚Äôs day, we have a new and more sinister form of media in Big Tech, actively censoring free speech and promoting leftist propaganda to blind our citizens to their real goals and the real consequences of their actions ‚Äì the end of America as we have known it.

The Socialist Left has been openly working to destroy the United States since Obama promised and tried to ‚Äútransform‚Äù America in 2008-16, and having been stopped by the will of the American people, they openly staged a four year long coup attempt to remove the duly elected President. Culminating in this corrupt and provably fraudulent current election planned to illegally and un-constitutionally deny the American people their most sacred honor, right and privilege ‚Äì which is the right to elect their Representatives! How can we have a Representative Republic if we cannot hold fair elections to elect our Representatives? There is no doubt that this attempted stealing of these elections again ‚Äúis a case of rebellion‚Ä¶in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion‚Äù that requires exercising extraordinary authority to preserve our Union.

President Trump, you and every other official in our local, state and federal governments, and everyone in law enforcement and in our military have sworn an oath that says ‚ÄúI will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.‚Äù It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it. The enemies are within our gates and our Constitution and Nation are in real risk of being lost to this socialist/communist invasion unless you act decisively.

At least half of all Americans do not and will not accept this fraudulent election because of the eyewitness testimony, and the material, statistical and mathematical evidence of OVERWHELMING fraud. The other half will not accept the outcome if the courts see the evidence of fraud and rightfully overturn the election! The Left has literally been planning riots just for that occasion for months. We the People must not and WILL NOT cede our exclusive Constitutional right to elect our Representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, Governors, Secretary‚Äôs of State, Congress, corrupt election officials and local politicians, the corrupt media ‚Äì or Leftist threats of violence! It is OUR EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to decide our Representatives not theirs! Therefore, We the People MUST demand a NEW and fair national vote, a vote that all Americans can trust and live by regardless of the winner! Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent. Gun sales are at an all time high and 40% are first time gun owners looking to defend themselves, their property, and their rights. Therefore, Mr. President you must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our Union.

When the legislators, courts and/or Congress fail to do their duty under the 12th Amendment, you must be ready Mr. President to immediately declare a limited form of Martial Law, and temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections, for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a national re-vote. A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people. Federal candidates only. Paper ballots. No computers. Hand-counted with both parties watching every vote. Only registered voters. Photo ID to prove residence. Conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, just like we did in Ohio. Only then can the winning candidate be accepted as legitimate by a true majority of We the People who must give our consent to be justly governed! Unfortunately we are at a point where we can only trust our military to do this because our corrupt political class and courts have proven their inability to act fairly and within the law.

You must also act, like Lincoln did, to silence the destructive media‚Äôs one-sided propaganda designed and proven to influence the election outcome, and end the unlawful censorship of Big Tech, to restore the confidence of the American People in our electoral process or we cannot continue as a nation. Failure to do so could result in massive violence and destruction on a level not seen since the Civil War. Limited Martial Law is clearly a better option than Civil War!

Many will object to these actions, as they did in Lincoln‚Äôs day, but we assure you that We the People understand that no less action will suffice to prevent the loss of our Constitutional right to vote and preserve our Republic. It is time to honor your oath, Mr. President. It is time for you to boldly act to save our nation as Lincoln did. We the People will support a national re-vote. We will also have no other choice but to take matters into our own hands, and defend our rights on our own, if you do not act within your powers to defend us.

‚ÄúThe United Kingdom, compared to most countries on the Outlook‚Äôs graph, got affected more heavily suffering a GDP reduction of 11.2% in 2020, with only Argentina showing worse results ‚Äì 12.9% drop.‚Äù

While small businesses continue to go bust and see their profits dwindle, Amazon and other massive transnational corporations have joined China in coming out of the pandemic on a strong economic footing.

Amazon has seen its profits during the COVID pandemic soar by 100% while small businesses on average have lost 30% in profits and 21% have closed down permanently.

The CEO‚Äôs of these companies have also seen their personal wealth increase by tens of billions while small businesses have lost over $200 billion.

As we previously highlighted, while the United States and Europe continue to subject their citizens to crippling lockdowns, people in China where the virus originated are enjoying massive pool parties and nightclubs where there is no social distancing or mask wearing.

Some have suggested that videos which emerged out of China in the early days of the pandemic which showed people convulsing and dropping dead on the streets were part of a propaganda ploy to convince other countries that coronavirus was immeasurably worse than it turned out to be.

259,17 Million Americans Behind on Mortgage or Rent Payments,[],"Even as market mania continues over hopes for a coronavirus vaccine, the economic devastation caused by the government response to the pandemic continues to ravage the economy.

Seventeen million households are behind on rent or mortgage payments, and nearly 6 million Americans say they are at risk of eviction in the next few months.

According to a survey by the US Census Bureau, roughly 5.8 million adults say they are somewhat to very likely to face eviction or foreclosure in the next two months.

A CARES Act program allowing homeowners to pause mortgage payments for up to a year is set to expire. Some homeowners in the program could face foreclosure as early as March. Meanwhile, the CDC‚Äôs nationwide suspension on evictions will expire on Dec. 31. Millions of Americans are also set to lose unemployment benefits at year-end unless Congress passes an extension.

The employment situation has also been deteriorating. Weekly unemployment claims set a record in March and have yet to fall below the previous record set during the Great Recession. Weekly jobless claims have risen each of the past three weeks.

And the employment picture doesn‚Äôt show any hope of improvement, with nearly 1-in-10 companies are planning layoffs in the next three months. That‚Äôs on top of the more than a quarter of US companies that have already let workers go in Q4.

There is also the looming prospect of more corporate bankruptcies and business closures, putting more pressure on the jobs market. More than 420,000 small businesses have closed their doors permanently since the beginning of the pandemic. That represents a staggering 7.1% of all small businesses. Brookings estimates that the US economy has lost some 4 million jobs in the small business sector ‚Äúthat will only return with the creation of new businesses.‚Äù On top of all this, Goldman Sachs projects even more permanent job losses coming down the pike as a wave of mergers, acquisitions and corporate takeovers sweeps through the economy.

This underscores the fact that despite optimism about a vaccine, nothing has fundamentally changed in the economy. And even if they cure COVID, it won‚Äôt instantaneously fix the economy. As Peter Schiff has put it, there is no vaccine for what ails the economy.

The US government will almost certainly pass a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy a while longer. That means more debt and more Federal Reserve money printing. But as Peter has been saying, this so-called COVID cure is what‚Äôs making the economy sick.

The real burden is not the COVID, but all the debt the economy accumulated while the Fed was trying to fight COVID. It‚Äôs the COVID cure that is far more harmful to the economy than the disease. So, even after the disease is gone, the cure is going to linger and is going to continue to do damage because we accumulated all this extra debt, because the Fed‚Äôs balance sheet is now so much bigger, because the stock market bubble is so much bigger, because the real estate bubble has gained new strength, because everybody has more leverage than they did before. And of course, the US economy is going to be less efficient in this post-COVID world as US companies are still going to have to be covering the costs of being able to prepare for the next lockdown or the next virus that comes up. We already know what the playbook is.‚Äù

The question Ludwig von Mises posed, on the other hand, is: More of what?

Economics is concerned with how this is decided. It is one thing to say that under socialism men enjoy their toil because they will find self-actualization in producing goods for each other. It is another thing entirely to demonstrate who, under socialism, will choose what is made for whom, how, where, with what, and by whom.

The basic economic problem, as it is sometimes called by economists, is that resources are scarce but human wants are unlimited. While primitive men faced with starvation (and animals) may well only be interested in the quantity of food the can secure, as soon as civilization reaches its early stages people are faced with the problem of choosing which one of their various competing desires they should satisfy. Given there are various ways of satisfying the same needs, they also have to answer the question of how they should satisfy them.

Mises defines human action itself as the employment of scarce means for the attainment of preferred ends. To act is to choose between two or more things that we cannot have both of, preferring one and setting aside the other.2

Under capitalism different business owners attempt to make competing products in all different ways, and the consumer will ultimately decide which of them get rich and which go out of business. Each of us, as customers, apply our scarce means, setting aside some products to buy others, and in doing so we decide what is produced and by whom. How is the same going to be determined efficiently in a moneyless society where wage labor has been abolished, such as Marx envisaged?

We Act Based on Our Idea of What Is Best for Us

Ultimately, some authority must decide. This is unsatisfactory to Mises. For him, a free man gets to decide himself how he spends his income, but in a society where an authority supplies those things they think the people need‚Äîor ought to have‚Äîmen are not free. Marxism does not differentiate between these two modes of want satisfaction and therefore does not apprehend the difference between freedom and slavery. The Marxian image of freedom looks more like this: ‚ÄúIf a man who wants to get the bible gets the Koran instead, he is no longer free.‚Äù3

To Mises, people can only determine for themselves their own interests, and the authority cannot give the people what they choose according to their own values, but only according to what the authority thinks their values ought to be. If the ‚Äúpaltry‚Äù individual disagrees, so much the worse for him. Mises writes: ‚ÄúOne does not serve the interests of a man who wants a new coat by giving him a pair of shoes or those of a man who wants to hear a Beethoven symphony by giving him admission to a boxing match. It is ideas that are responsible for the fact that the interests of people are disparate.‚Äù4

This remains an issue of contention to this day. Should the consumer decide what kind of healthcare they receive, or is it better if the government decides on their behalf and supplies it to them as a public service? While socialized healthcare is a popular idea, those who can afford private services usually avail themselves of the best they can buy. This reveals that most people accept that the private sector does a better job of providing healthcare than the state. Those who cannot afford private care in countries with socialized medicine have to accept whatever they are given. They cannot push administrators to improve the quality of services by threatening to ‚Äútake their business elsewhere.‚Äù Similarly, politicians are sometimes the subject of scandals when the media unearths the fact they sent their children to a private school. It is roundly taken as an admission that they don‚Äôt believe the services provided by government are good enough for their own children but are willing to impose them upon their constituents.

Mises says that even if we granted, for the sake of argument, that there was no uncertainty concerning what people wanted or how it should be produced, there would still remain the question of weighing people‚Äôs short-term interests against their long-term ones. Everyone has to evaluate for himself how much he values the health that comes from strict exercise and diet, for example, against the enjoyment of leisure and tasty snacks. This depends on one‚Äôs own, individual ideas and subjective evaluations.

The same applies on a larger scale for production in society. Should we save more so that more can be invested in machines and technology that will make society wealthier in the long term, or should we enjoy increased material standards of living in the here and now? There is no correct, objective answer to such a question. A subjective evaluation has to be made by someone or some people. Under capitalism individuals make their own decisions as to how much to consume and how much to save, and the aggregatation of those individual decisions forms the final answer. Under socialism‚Äîwho knows? Usually it is left to a government department to guess and impose their will upon the people. Invariably this leads to mass overproduction of certain commodities and underproduction of others. Sadly too often it has led to famine: in the Soviet Union from 1921‚Äì22 and 1946‚Äì47, as well as in the Ukraine (1932‚Äì34), China (1958‚Äì62), Cambodia (1979), Ethiopia (1983‚Äì85), and in North Korea (1995‚Äì99). To Mises these famines were not chance occurrences that could have happened under any system. They were a direct result of the fact that under socialism central planners have no reliable means of calculating what to produce or how to produce it, and were completely predictable by economic theory.5

Marx does not attempt to solve this problem. Perhaps he never even considered that it might actually be a problem. He simply claimed that socialism, as the next stage in history, would be an earthly paradise in which questions such as these would settle themselves and everyone would get all they needed. The Land of Cockaigne, as Mises likes to refer to it.

How to Achieve the Socialist Paradise?

Of course, if this were true, then no one could deny that socialism was in everyone‚Äôs interests. Who could oppose it? The problem begins when any discussion of how they will get what they need is dismissed as ‚Äúunscientific.‚Äù This may well be why all attempts at communism have so far not only failed but resulted in death and misery for countless victims. The primary reason these regimes fail is not merely because their leaders were evil, although they may have been, or because America intervened to undermine the regime‚Äîas it certainly did, for example, in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cambodia, East Timor, and many other places. The fundamental reason was because of a failure to organize production.

In a hypothetical paradise people would no longer need any ideas. They wouldn‚Äôt have to make judgments and evaluate which course of action is likely to secure their needs. All would be given. However, in reality, ideas determine what people consider to be their interests. A person‚Äôs interests cannot be independent of their ideas. It is ideas that determine what people consider their interests to be. You can say it is in my interests to eat well, but that‚Äôs only if I want to live and be healthy. If I choose to die, or am already dying and want to eat chocolate cake until I finally pop off, then who can dispute my evaluation of my interests? Free men do not act in accordance with their interests, because what their interests are are an arbitrary questions of judgment. We act invariably upon what we believe our interests to be.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,Why Central Bank Digital Currencies Are a Bad Idea,[],"Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are being sold with the narrative of protecting consumers who are increasingly moving to cashless payments.

Some say that these cashless payments will rob us of the privacy advantages of cash while exposing us to bank runs, payment network blackouts, and foreign financial adversaries.

Yet while these risks are real, they would be negligible had it not been for the central banking and financial regulators‚Äô interventions into the market. CBDCs make these interventions worse and introduce some new, much bigger ones.

Design Implications

While the stated intention behind CBDCs is to keep the commercial banks in the picture, these digital currencies will bring their end users closer to the central banks. This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single common ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and, e.g., change the inflation rate.

A permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn‚Äôt provide the immutability feature, but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than it has right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.

Helicopter Money

The reason why we‚Äôve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable, and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.

Economists of the Austrian school understand that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo-)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.

The problem is that the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy that hasn‚Äôt fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn‚Äôt brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels. Needless to say, commercial banks‚Äô cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn‚Äôt align well with the central bank‚Äôs goals either. During the covid crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation. Since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn‚Äôt‚Äîcapital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers.

With closer integration of the monetary spigot and the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit or just outright cash-outs to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply ‚Äúairdropping‚Äù new tokens to the existing users. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture‚Äîthey would still serve as custodians of the token keys and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.

This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks‚Äô dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists have had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure. And while monetary overdoses such as we‚Äôve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don‚Äôt perform well, as Japan‚Äôs three lost decades of Bank of Japan (BOJ) interventions have demonstrated.

Negative Interest Rates

Hoarding is evil‚Äîor so the modern monetarists‚Äô narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings are just money that doesn‚Äôt work in spurring the miracles of spending- and money supply‚Äìdriven economic growth. Negative interest rates, then, are potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding‚Äîby incentivizing savings account holders to spend their depreciating balances. Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on to their customers, but commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative-yielding accounts to interest-yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.

With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly to their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would certainly increase the consumers‚Äô and businesses‚Äô propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people tried to offload their cash savings. But to think of this as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe will lead to a different, let alone better, outcome is ludicrous.

Financial Surveillance

The final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people‚Äôs privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that a branch of government that imposes KYC/AML rules on existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch nonviolent ‚Äúcriminals‚Äù cares about our privacy is laughable.

They‚Äôre not even hiding the fact that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call ‚Äúdata analytics.‚Äù To think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be na√Øve.

It‚Äôs not a coincidence that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to a government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.

Pro-CBDC Arguments Are Misleading

The proponents of the central banking tokens argue that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country‚Äôs payment network. While such a risk exists‚Äîfor example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors (as it used to) and as a result Visa and Mastercard were pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country‚Äîif it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.

If anything, the biggest attacks on monetary exchange in the Western world have come from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises, as was the case in Cyprus or Greece (not to mention that central banks themselves caused those crises with their credit bubbles of the preceding periods).

The argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn‚Äôt pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.

CBDCs Will Come and Will Make Things Worse

In conclusion, the reasons why central banks champion CBDCs are the strongest reasons for which people should oppose the transition toward them. But while the pretense of an investigation into fiat money tokenization gives the impression of there being a debate on the topic, the reality is that there is no debate: the digital currencies will go through and give central banks more control than they had before with all the disastrous consequences such control brings.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
262,America‚Äôs Pride In The Economy Is About To Be Greatly Shaken As Tens Of Millions Face Eviction In 2021,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Unless there is emergency intervention, tens of millions of Americans could be facing eviction once the holiday season is over.

We kicked the can down the road throughout 2020, but all of the rent that was originally owed to landlords all over the country is still due, and they are very eager to collect.

Countless landlords are on the verge of financial ruin because of the rent moratoriums which were put in place, and kicking the can down the road even more would be absolutely disastrous for them.

Of course it would also be absolutely disastrous if the moratoriums are not extended, because in some states more than half of all households are behind on their rent or mortgage payments, and most of them have no way to pay.

Can you imagine who counter to reality our lives would be if someone who can‚Äôt even identify her own gender is responsible for the terms we define medicine by?

One way or the other, we are about to hit a breaking point. The Aspen Institute is telling us that a whopping 40 million people ‚Äúcould face eviction over the next several months‚Äù‚Ä¶

According to research by the Aspen Institute, nearly 40 million Americans could face eviction over the next several months. The only thing holding back the flood right now is the CDC‚Äôs eviction moratorium order and a patchwork of state and local protections for renters. But these moratoriums are only kicking the can down the road. Chief economist for Moody‚Äôs Analytics Mark Zandi told the Washington Post that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year‚Äôs end. And for landlords left holding the bag, there‚Äôs been little relief, as they‚Äôve been forced to take on the role of government ‚Äî subsidizing housing for millions even as their own taxes, mortgage payments, and other expenses are due.

That is about 12 percent of the entire country.

If they get evicted, where are they going to go?

Into the streets?

Vox recently interviewed a 48-year-old Texas resident named ‚ÄúKimberly‚Äù, and she says that is exactly where she is headed if she gets evicted‚Ä¶

But after Covid-19 hit, she lost hours at her job as a crew trainer at Raising Cane‚Äôs Chicken Fingers and found herself on the brink of financial collapse. She fell behind on her rent and when she tried to work with her landlord to set up a repayment plan, she told Vox that she was served an eviction notice. Now, the only thing keeping her in her home is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention‚Äôs (CDC) national eviction moratorium, which prohibits landlords from evicting qualifying tenants for failing to make rent. If she‚Äôs evicted, Kimberly says she has nowhere to go ‚Äî and will be homeless for the second time in five years.

And there are countless others out there that are just like her.

According to Zero Hedge, ‚Äúat least half of households in Arkansas, Florida and Nevada are not current on rent and mortgage payments‚Äù.

We have never seen anything like this in modern American history, and the new lockdowns that are being instituted across the nation will just make things even worse.

Of course there are many Americans that will be able to move in with family, and this has already been happening in very large numbers. In particular, young people are moving back in with their parents on a massive scale. According to the Pew Research Center, ‚Äúa majority of young adults in the U.S. live with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression‚Äù.

The phrase ‚Äúsince the Great Depression‚Äù has been popping up a lot lately, hasn‚Äôt it?

That is because this is literally the first economic depression that the U.S. has experienced since that time.

Everywhere we look, we can see the sort of economic devastation that I have been warning was coming for a very long time.

In New Jersey, approximately one-third of all small businesses ‚Äúhave closed down in 2020‚Äù‚Ä¶

A third of small businesses in New Jersey have closed down in 2020, according to a report from The Star-Ledger newspaper. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really bad‚Ä¶ And without federal dollars coming into New Jersey, the Main Street stores and other establishments are not gonna make it through the winter.‚Äù said Eileen Kean, the state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.

New Jersey‚Äôs number is higher than the national average, but not by very much.

Of course Atlantic City has been hit particularly hard because it is so dependent on tourism. At this point, it is being called ‚Äúthe city without a pulse‚Äù‚Ä¶

The boardwalk is empty, the beaches are deserted, and the casinos, though partially reopen, are limping into their fifth month of severely curtailed operations after four months of shutdowns. The coronavirus pandemic skewered the economic engine of this beachside town, taking the city‚Äôs vibrancy and its residents‚Äô livelihoods out with it.

Sadly, things are inevitably going to get worse in the months ahead thanks to the new lockdowns. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has risen significantly for the past two weeks, and more bad weeks are almost certainly ahead.

Needless to say, rising unemployment will mean more Americans being pushed out of their homes and more Americans being pushed into poverty. According to a survey that was released in October, the number of Americans living in poverty has risen by 8 million since May‚Ä¶

The number of Americans living in poverty grew by 8 million since May, according to a Columbia University study, which found an increase in poverty rates after early coronavirus relief ended without more to follow. Although the federal Cares Act, which gave Americans a one-time stimulus check of $1,200 and unemployed workers an extra $600 each week, was successful at offsetting growing poverty rates in the spring, the effects were short-lived, researchers found in the study published Thursday.

Of course that number is more than a month old, and so the true number of Americans that have been forced into poverty is substantially higher by now.

This is what an economic collapse looks like, and even worse days are ahead of us.

The good news is that those that were warned in advance that an economic collapse was coming had time to make preparations for this sort of a scenario.

But most Americans never wanted to listen to the warnings, and so now they find themselves in the middle of a storm without an umbrella.

Unfortunately, what we have experienced so far is just the leading edge of the storm, and most people still do not realize that.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other entertainment venues, such as cinemas, bowling alleys, and skating rinks, will have to close outright.

The volunteer, a 40-year-old man from Chennai, claims he suffered severe neurological damage after taking part in the phase three trial of Covishield. He sued SII for Rs 5 crore ($676,000 USD) and demanded SII, AstraZeneca and the Oxford Vaccine Group immediately halt vaccine trials, involving some 1,600 volunteers.

The man reportedly suffered from headaches and vomiting ten days after receiving the jab. He was taken to the hospital after displaying abnormal behavior.

The trial participant was later discharged at his own request. Hospital documents stated he was recovering from ‚Äúacute encephalopathy,‚Äù was suffering from vitamin deficiencies and was suspected of having a ‚Äúconnective tissue disorder.‚Äù

Voting machines are being wiped as per Georgia judge and no one is aware of the blatant discarding of the rights of We The People.

‚ÄúMy initial report is that U.S. soldiers were killed in that operation. Now, that was a CIA operation, so that‚Äôs the very worrisome thing. Did that occur because of what Mary and I, and Allen, were notifying on Sunday and the Monday in different networks, that this was going to happen, that they were using Hammer and Scorecard‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôre saying is that President Trump needs to fulfill his oath that he took to defend America against enemies both foreign and domestic, and he must not let deadlines stop him from fulfilling that oath. Is that what I hear you say?‚Äù Howse asked.

Violent clashes and arson have erupted in Paris amid mass protests against police brutality and a draft law that would ban filming officers ‚Äúin certain circumstances,‚Äù after a video emerged of cops beating a black music producer.

Thousands of people rallied against the controversial bill in more than 70 French cities on Saturday, with the organizers claiming over half a million participants and authorities estimating the number at around 150,000. The daytime rallies went off peacefully, but by early evening clashes erupted in multiple cities, including Rennes, Lille, Bordeaux and Lyon.

Sporadic clashes with smaller groups continued into the night, long after the bulk of the demonstrators had left the Place de la Bastill, with hundreds of officers in full riot gear seen chasing protesters down side streets, struggling to contain the unrest.

China will consider individuals who seriously endanger people‚Äôs health and safety, or disrupt markets‚Äô fair competition and normal social order, as threats to society under its new social credit guidelines.

State broadcaster CCTV reported that the measures were discussed during a recent meeting of the state council citing a state council meeting led by Premier Li Keqiang, President Xi‚Äôs point man for handling the fallout for the coronavirus.

Among these new punitive measures, China will promote quality development of the credit reporting industry, while encouraging the sharing of credit information related to finance, government administration and public utilities, and speed up orderly use of government-related data Strengthen information security and privacy protection.

The meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday, decided on measures to refine the bad-faith deterrent mechanism to promote the orderly and healthy development of the social credit system.

The principles include adhering to laws and regulations, protecting rights and interests, taking a prudent and appropriate approach and implementing list-based management.

Protesters throughout France have shown up for rallies against a controversial draft law on public safety, under which filming a police officer on duty may result in a hefty fine. Critics say it fosters impunity for misconduct.

The protests were organized in many large French cities, including Paris, Marseilles, Lyon, Brest and Nice, with thousands participating despite Covid-19 concerns. The main event is happening in the Place de la R√©publique in the capital.

The demonstrators are voicing their anger over a draft law on public security, which was approved by the lower chamber of the parliament this week. Article 24 of the bill bans filming of police officers on duty with an intention to harm them. Lawmakers who voted for the bill are among the officials who were shamed by the protesters.

The reasoning behind the provision, which introduces a fine of ‚Ç¨45,000 ($53,450) or even a one-year jail term, is that members of the force need to be protected from doxxing and online harassment. Critics say it curtails journalistic freedoms and would be used to intimidate people who want to expose police brutality and other forms of misconduct.

The protests were organized by unions, but they have many supporters. The Yellow Vests movement, which was sparked by growing social and economic inequality and for months remained a major problem for President Emmanuel Macron, is among them.

There is also a component of racism in why the proposed law sparked so much anger. Police abuse of people of color became more visible thanks to the spread of mobile phones with good cameras and social media.

The whistleblower from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which operates a network of 35 hospitals in western Pennsylvania, described how the latest ‚Äúsurge‚Äù of Covid cases was overblown by the media.

During this period, he said, hospitalizations increased from 96 beds to 600 beds, where the patients were kept in observation overnight and no deaths resulted.

However, the media will report that there was a 600% increase in hospitalizations to make it seem more dire and to justify another lockdown.

For example, if you start with 5 patients to 25, the media will say there was a 500% increase in cases ‚Äî sounds terrifying, right?

An academic paper released in April of this year outlines how smart cities and artificial intelligence will be used for ‚Äúenforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks‚Äú

Under a Biden Presidency, the long-standing plans of globalists to usher in ‚ÄúPlanned-Opolis‚Äù cities will be realized.

A recent headline suggested that Biden will move forward with the smart city plan: ‚ÄúThe Biden Administration Could Be Good for Smart Cities‚Äù:

‚ÄúIn general, Biden‚Äôs campaign rhetoric has tended to signal good things for urban tech initiatives. The president-elect has promised to ‚Äúencourage innovation and launch smarter cities‚Äù ‚Äî with a particular eye on transportation.‚Äù

While they are promoted as a futuristic vision of utopia, smart cities around the world utilized smart city technology as ‚Äúcommand and control centers‚Äù to enforce tyrannical COVID lockdowns. As part of the United Nations Agenda 2030, the world is moving to construct the cities.

In 2008, OTN reported on the testing of smart cities in South Korea. Bill Gates‚Äô Microsoft played a key role in developing the technology.

South Korea was chosen for the test because, in the words of the city‚Äôs developers, ‚ÄúThere is an historical expectation of less privacy.‚Äù The New York Times reported:

‚ÄúMuch of this technology was developed in U.S. research labs, but there are fewer social and regulatory obstacles to implementing them in Korea,‚Äù said Mr. Townsend [a research director at the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California], who consulted on Seoul‚Äôs own U-city plan, known as Digital Media City. ‚ÄúThere is an historical expectation of less privacy. Korea is willing to put off the hard questions to take the early lead and set standards.‚Äù

An academic paper released in April of this year outlines how smart cities and artificial intelligence will be used for ‚Äúenforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks‚Äú. The paper concludes that, ‚ÄúThe proposed architecture and AI assisted applications‚Ä¶ can be used to effectively and timely enforce social distancing community measures, and optimize the use of resources in critical situations.‚Äù

China is building ‚ÄúCOVID-proof‚Äù cities ‚Äúwith future lockdowns in mind‚Äú.

India utilized its Varanasi smart city to enforce the COVID lockdown:

‚ÄúTo keep a tight vigil on the movement of people during the lockdown and tab on home-quarantined people infected with covid-19, Varanasi, the PM‚Äôs own constituency, is using CCTVs and geographic information system (GIS) technology accessed through its integrated command and control centre (ICCC) set up under the smart city mission.‚Äù

When people become desperate enough, those in power can get most of them to do just about anything.

The first wave of lockdowns knocked us into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it sent suicide rates soaring all over the globe, and it plunged millions upon millions of ordinary citizens into a deep state of despair.

Now another wave of lockdowns is being instituted all over the planet, and this is going to perfectly set the stage for the ‚Äúsolutions‚Äù that the elite plan to offer all of us in 2021.

It has been said that if you want people to be willing to accept a solution, first you have to make them realize that they have a problem.

And once this ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù finally ends, almost everybody will be absolutely desperate to return to their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lives.

Owen and Enrique Tarrio react to a viral picture of an old man being hugged by a doctor in full hazmat suit during Thanksgiving.

With each passing day, more extremely harsh restrictions are being imposed. For example, a brand new ‚Äústay at home order‚Äù was just issued in Los Angeles County‚Ä¶

All public and private gatherings with anyone outside a single household are now banned in Los Angeles County, as most of the country grapples with an unprecedented surge of Covid-19. The ban will last three weeks, starting Monday and ending December 20.

It would be nice if the lockdown actually does get lifted before the end of the year, but for at least the next three weeks all 10 million people living in L.A. County will be forced ‚Äúto stay home as much as possible‚Äù‚Ä¶

All 10 million residents are asked to stay home as much as possible and wear face masks when outside ‚Äî even when exercising at the beach and parks, said the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which issued the order last week.

On top of that, California Governor Gavin Newsom is warning that he may soon impose ‚Äúmuch more dramatic, arguably drastic‚Äù restrictions for the entire state‚Ä¶

California Gov Gavin Newsom just warned that more drastic steps could be taken to contain the virus after the state reported another 15k+ new cases yesterday. The Golden State could be facing ‚Äúmuch more dramatic, arguably drastic‚Äù measures to contain the spread of the virus. The state also broke its record for hospitalized patients yesterday: The state reported 7,415 coronavirus hospitalizations, with more than 1,700 of those patients in ICUs. The number of hospitalizations broke the state‚Äôs previous record of 7,170 in July.

Unfortunately, we are witnessing similar craziness all over the nation. In New Mexico, the new restrictions that were just instituted created so much panic that people were soon waiting for hours just to get into a supermarket to shop for food‚Ä¶

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has put immense pressure on businesses with her ‚Äúabrupt‚Äù lockdown order ‚Äì forcing ‚Äúnonessential‚Äù businesses to close and creating what has been dubbed ‚Äúmodern breadlines‚Äù ‚Äî with people waiting 2-4 hours to enter essential retailers, former GOP Senate candidate Elisa Martinez explained during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday.

After seeing what the first round of lockdowns did to our nation, why would these politicians want to do it again?

More than 70 million Americans have filed unemployment claims so far in 2020, more than 40 million could be facing eviction in 2021, and there has been a dramatic spike in suicides during this pandemic.

When a 90-year-old woman named Nancy Russell found out that another lockdown was happening in her area, she decided to opt for assisted suicide‚Ä¶

According to CTV News, a 90-year-old woman living in Toronto took her own life via medically assisted suicide, the choice made in large part due to the second surge of coronavirus cases and a looming period of increased restrictions.

As I keep reminding my readers, there is always hope if you look at the bigger picture and suicide is never the answer to anything.

Unfortunately, most people are not getting a message of hope from the mainstream media, and Russell decided that the months ahead were going to be too bleak in her nursing home for her to be able to handle‚Ä¶

Residents eat meals in their rooms, have activities and social gatherings cancelled, family visits curtailed or eliminated. Sometimes they are in isolation in their small rooms for days. These measures, aimed at saving lives, can sometimes be detrimental enough to the overall health of residents that they find themselves looking into other options.

Just as we are hitting a low point with this pandemic, authorities all over the globe are announcing that vaccines will soon be available.

In fact, it is being reported that as many as ten different vaccines could be available by the middle of 2021‚Ä¶

Ten COVID-19 vaccines could be available by the middle of next year if they win regulatory approval, but their inventors need patent protection, the head of the global pharmaceutical industry group said on Friday.

As soon as the public can get them, it is inevitable that millions upon millions of people will rush out to get their shots so that they can return to their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lives.

But what they aren‚Äôt telling you is that these new vaccines are entirely different from vaccines that you may have gotten previously.

These new mRNA vaccines will actually ‚Äúhijack‚Äù your cells if you take them‚Ä¶

When Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote about the vaccine and described it this way: ‚ÄúIt uses a sequence of genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells‚Äô protein-making machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.‚Äù ‚ÄúIn this case, Moderna‚Äôs mRNA-1273 is programmed to make your cells produce the coronavirus‚Äô infamous coronavirus spike protein that gives the virus its crown-like appearance (corona is crown in Latin) for which it is named,‚Äù wrote The Independent.

Under normal circumstances, very few people would sign up to have their cells ‚Äúhijacked‚Äù, but at this point millions upon millions of people will be so desperate for a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that they will take a vaccine no matter what the long-term consequences might be.

And if you don‚Äôt take one of the vaccines, you may soon find that you aren‚Äôt able to fly internationally‚Ä¶

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced this week it is in the final phase of development for what it hopes will be universally accepted documentation that in turn could boost confidence among wary travelers. The digital health pass would include a passenger‚Äôs testing and vaccine information and would manage and verify information among governments, airlines, laboratories and travelers.

If these new ‚Äúdigital vaccine passports‚Äù are implemented for international travel, it is probably just a matter of time before they are required for domestic travel as well.

Of course there are lots of people out there that are trying to sound the alarm about all of this, but UN communications director Melissa Fleming says that her organization has already recruited an army of ‚Äú110,000 information volunteers‚Äù to combat the spread of ‚Äúmisinformation‚Äù‚Ä¶

Fleming told the World Economic Forum that #PledgetoPause and Verified have ‚Äúrecruited 110,000 information volunteers‚Äù thus far. She said ‚Äúwe equip these information volunteers with the kind of knowledge about how misinformation spreads and ask them to serve as kind of ‚Äòdigital first-responders‚Äô.‚Äù Fleming has stated elsewhere that the UN has ‚Äúreached out to Member States, UN media partners, celebrity supporters‚Äù and ‚Äúbusinesses‚Äù ‚Äúto help us disseminate to the millions we will need to reach‚Äù with the campaign.

They want to control what you think as they lead you into a dystopian future that will ultimately turn into a complete and utter nightmare.

The truth is that none of us will be going back to our ‚Äúnormal lives‚Äù ever again.

But the elite will continue to hold that carrot out there in order to get you to do what they want, and millions upon millions of people will fall for it.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
290,Strange ‚ÄúCoincidences‚Äù That Should Deeply Bother All Of Us As We Try To Put The Puzzle Pieces Together,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Whether you are a Republican, a Democrat or someone that doesn‚Äôt identify with either major party, you should care deeply about the integrity of our elections.

Because if we don‚Äôt have elections that are free and fair, our system of government simply will not work.

If we come out of the 2020 elections with about half the country believing that the race for president was rigged, that is a major problem.

Once faith in our elections is gone, it will be nearly impossible to restore, and that is why it is absolutely imperative that we try to figure out how this election went so haywire.

In recent days, I have seen so many people point out some of the numbers from the election that should be deeply bothering all of us. In this article, I am going to try to summarize some of the most important points.

Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio joins The Alex Jones Show to expose the leftist idealism taking hold in America, and how closely it resembles the militant authoritarian communism his family had to flee from in Cuba.

In 2012, Barack Obama cruised to re-election even though he received 3.5 million less votes than he got in 2008.

In 2020, President Trump was supposedly soundly defeated even though he received 11 million more votes than he did in 2016.

They are telling us that Trump was defeated because of a historic turnout by Biden voters. But the number of counties that Biden actually won was a record low for a ‚Äúwinning candidate‚Äù by a very wide margin. It is being reported that Trump won 83 percent of all U.S. counties, and Biden only won 17 percent‚Ä¶

We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.

How in the world can you win the presidency by losing more than 80 percent of the counties in the entire country?

Yes, I understand that the major population centers are where the votes are. But when Obama won his two elections, at least he was victorious in more than 20 percent of all U.S. counties both times‚Ä¶

Former President Obama ushered in the previous low in 2012, winning re-election with just 689 counties, or 22 percent ‚Äì breaking his own record set in 2008, where he won with 875 counties, or 28 percent.

Biden underperformed Obama almost everywhere except in the urban population centers that were absolutely critical to Biden‚Äôs victory.

In those urban population centers, Biden supposedly piled up obscene vote totals that are very difficult to believe.

And it just so happens that those heavily blue urban population centers all seemed to stop counting votes at about the same time on the night of the election. All of a sudden, voting came to a standstill in Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Atlanta.

As many have pointed out, if you stop and wait to see how all of the other areas of your state have voted, you can figure out exactly how many votes you need to put your candidate over the top.

When counting finally resumed, there were four massive vote dumps in the middle of the night which proved decisive in some of the most critical swing states‚Ä¶

An update in Michigan listed as of 6:31AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 141,258 votes for Joe Biden and 5,968 votes for Donald Trump An update in Wisconsin listed as 3:42AM Central Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 143,379 votes for Joe Biden and 25,163 votes for Donald Trump A vote update in Georgia listed at 1:34AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 136,155 votes for Joe Biden and 29,115 votes for Donald Trump An update in Michigan listed as of 3:50AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 54,497 votes for Joe Biden and 4,718 votes for Donald Trump

In the end, Biden won Wisconsin by less than one percent, he won Pennsylvania by just over one percent, he won Georgia by less than one percent and he won Arizona by less than one percent.

If you reverse the results in those four states, President Trump would be the winner of the race.

The voting behavior in the key midwestern states was particularly suspicious. The following comes from Patrick Basham‚Ä¶

Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump‚Äôs direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden‚Äôs ‚Äòwinning‚Äô margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.

There are countless people that have been looking into how vote totals in the most critical swing states may have been manipulated, but the big tech companies have been doing their best to keep such information from spreading widely.

In fact, it is being reported that Facebook applied an ‚Äúemergency change‚Äù to its news feed algorithm right after the election‚Ä¶

In the aftermath of the contentious presidential election, Facebook reportedly made an ‚Äúemergency change‚Äù to its algorithm, which resulted in the suppression of content from ‚Äúhyperpartisan‚Äù outlets. Employees at Facebook are now asking if the ‚Äúnicer news feed‚Äù can stay in place long term, according to a Tuesday report from The New York Times.

This ‚Äúnicer news feed‚Äù greatly favors mainstream news outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

291,Ron Paul: Trump Pardons Flynn‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a Good Start!,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Last week President Trump granted a ‚Äúfull pardon‚Äù to Gen. Michael Flynn, his first National Security Advisor. In a White House statement announcing the pardon, the Administration pointed out that the relentless pursuit of Flynn was a partisan effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

The pursuit of Flynn was spearheaded by people who refused to accept the results of the 2016 election and worked to undermine the peaceful transfer of power, said the White House. These same people are the ones accusing Trump of undermining the election by challenging what appears to be serious voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election.

That is called ‚Äúprojection.‚Äù

The White House statement also cites partisans in politics, the media, and the Deep State which sought to prevent Trump from being elected, to prevent him from taking office once elected, and to remove him on false pretenses once in office.

In order to push the false narrative that Trump was somehow elected due to the intervention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the coup-masters had to make it appear that a high-ranking official was involved in monkey business with the Russians. Flynn was the unlucky victim of their smear machine, accused of ‚ÄúRussia collusion‚Äù over an innocent telephone call with the then-Russian Ambassador in Washington during the transition to a Trump Administration.

Yet when Joe Biden‚Äôs transition people bragged recently that Biden was connecting with foreign officials before inaugurated, the media praised it as a welcome return of the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù to foreign policy.

While it is very good news that President Trump is in the mood to pardon those victims of the warmongering Deep State, I very much hope that he is only warming up. It would be a great tragedy if other Deep State victims are left to suffer for their non-crimes.

Tweeting about her legislation that calls for charges against Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to be dropped and the Espionage Act reformed, US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard told President Trump, ‚Äúsince you‚Äôre giving pardons to people, please consider pardoning those who, at great personal sacrifice, exposed the deception and criminality of those in the deep state.‚Äù

My good friend Rep. Thomas Massie, a Ron Paul Institute Board Member, is a co-sponsor of Rep. Gabbard‚Äôs legislation, making it a real bipartisan effort to restore the rule of law in the United States and to rein in the Beltway warmongers.

Edward Snowden and Julian Assange are not criminals. They are heroes for telling us the truth about what criminals in government were doing in our name and with our money.

The fact is we were lied into war over and over again. While those wars were profitable for the military-industrial-Congressional-media complex, they snuffed out the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people overseas and robbed our own children and grandchildren of trillions of dollars wasted on neocon lies. And meanwhile, as Ed Snowden showed us, the intelligence community declared us the enemy and set up an elaborate internal spy network that would make the East German Stasi green with envy.

President Trump: you have the incredible opportunity to right the terrible wrongs perpetrated by the Obama/Biden Administration. History will smile kindly upon you if you also grant full pardon to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden ‚Äì and any other truth-teller who faces persecution for exposing the Deep State warmongers.

292,‚ÄúDark Winter‚Äù Was The Code Name For A Scenario In Which A Biological Weapon Was Used Against The American Populace,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Could it be possible that the phrase ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù has some sort of deeper meaning that most of us are not meant to understand?

We have heard that phrase over and over again in recent weeks, and usually it has been used in discussions regarding the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But it also turns out that ‚ÄúDark Winter‚Äù was also a code name for a high level simulation that was conducted back in 2001.

That simulation envisioned a scenario in which a widespread smallpox attack was unleashed inside the United States.

As you will see below, the simulation was ‚Äúdesigned to spiral out of control‚Äù, and the hypothetical consequences were absolutely disastrous.

Callers all over the nation are demanding the world arrest the criminals trying to steal the elction and getting away with it.

The reason why this is a concern is because so many of these ‚Äúsimulations‚Äù and ‚Äúexercises‚Äù end up mirroring real life events that happen at a later date.

For example, most of you have probably heard about Event 201 by now. On October 18th, 2019 a group of prominent individuals gathered in New York City to simulate what would happen during a worldwide coronavirus pandemic‚Ä¶

Event 201 simulates an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.

Of course COVID-19 started spreading in China just a few weeks later.

We have seen this same pattern happen so many times, and now we are being told over and over again that a ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù is ahead.

For example, Joe Biden specifically warned us about a ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù during the final presidential debate in October‚Ä¶

Joe Biden warned at Thursday night‚Äôs presidential debate that the U.S. was ‚Äúabout to go into a dark winter,‚Äù echoing the concerns of public health experts who caution about increased daily Covid-19 case counts converging with the annual flu season. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter,‚ÄùBiden said. ‚ÄúAnd he has no clear plan, and there‚Äôs no prospect that there‚Äôs going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.‚Äù

It is interesting to note that he repeated the phrase twice.

It is almost as if he was determined to make sure that he said it correctly.

And then he started using the phrase over and over again on the campaign trail and he kept using it even after the voting was over.

For example, here is an instance where he used the phrase on the Monday after the election‚Ä¶

Joe Biden on Monday warned that a ‚Äúvery dark winter‚Äù is approaching as the U.S. coronavirus case count nears 10 million. ‚ÄúThere is a need for bold action to fight this pandemic,‚Äù Biden said in Delaware. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still facing a very dark winter.‚Äù

I never thought too much about his use of that phrase, but could it be possible that it is actually some sort of a code word or signal?

We do know that it was a code word for a high level exercise that was held in 2001. The following comes from Wikipedia‚Ä¶

It is interesting to note that smallpox is a highly infectious disease that involves sores appearing on the skin.

For those that have read my latest book, you already understand why that detail is so important to me.

And as I already mentioned above, this exercise was specifically designed ‚Äúto spiral out of control‚Äù‚Ä¶

Dark Winter‚Äôs simulated scenario involved an initial localized smallpox attack on Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with additional smallpox attack cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The simulation was then designed to spiral out of control. This would create a contingency in which the National Security Council struggles to determine both the origin of the attack as well as deal with containing the spreading virus. By not being able to keep pace with the disease‚Äôs rate of spread, a new catastrophic contingency emerges in which massive civilian casualties would overwhelm America‚Äôs emergency response capabilities.

Could it be possible that Biden and others are using the phrase ‚Äúdark winter‚Äù to signal that something is about to spiral out of control?

I don‚Äôt know. I am just asking the question.

In Operation Dark Winter, the spread of smallpox also resulted in a ‚Äúmassive loss of civilian life‚Äù‚Ä¶

The disastrous contingencies that would result in the massive loss of civilian life were used to exploit the weaknesses of the U.S. health care infrastructure and its inability to handle such a threat. The contingencies were also meant to address the widespread panic that would emerge and which would result in mass social breakdown and mob violence. Exploits would also include the many difficulties that the media would face when providing American citizens with the necessary information regarding safety procedures. Discussing the outcome of Dark Winter, Bryan Walsh noted ‚ÄúThe timing‚Äìjust a few months before the 9/11 attack‚Äìwas eerily prescient, as if the organizers had foreseen how the threat of terrorism, including bioterrorism, would come to consume the U.S. government and public in the years to come.‚Äù[4]

So let me try to summarize what we have learned.

Operation Dark Winter envisioned a scenario in which a highly infectious disease that causes sores on the skin spirals out of control and causes a ‚Äúmassive loss of civilian life‚Äù.

And suddenly Joe Biden and other elitists have begun repeating this phrase over and over again as we head into 2021.

293,Landmark Legal Ruling Finds That Covid Tests Not Fit For Purpose ‚Äî So What Does MSM Do? They Ignore It,[],"Four German holidaymakers who were illegally quarantined in Portugal after one was judged to be positive for Covid-19 have won their case, in a verdict that condemns the widely-used PCR test as being up to 97-percent unreliable.

Earlier this month, Portuguese judges upheld a decision from a lower court that found the forced quarantine of four holidaymakers to be unlawful. The case centred on the reliability (or lack thereof) of Covid-19 PCR tests.

The verdict, delivered on November 11, followed an appeal against a writ of habeas corpus filed by four Germans against the Azores Regional Health Authority. This body had been appealing a ruling from a lower court which had found in favour of the tourists, who claimed that they were illegally confined to a hotel without their consent. The tourists were ordered to stay in the hotel over the summer after one of them tested positive for coronavirus in a PCR test ‚Äì the other three were labelled close contacts and therefore made to quarantine as well.

Unreliable, with a strong chance of false positives

The deliberation of the Lisbon Appeal Court is comprehensive and fascinating. It ruled that the Azores Regional Health Authority had violated both Portuguese and international law by confining the Germans to the hotel. The judges also said that only a doctor can ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù someone with a disease, and were critical of the fact that they were apparently never assessed by one.

They were also scathing about the reliability of the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, the most commonly used check for Covid.

The conclusion of their 34-page ruling included the following: ‚ÄúIn view of current scientific evidence, this test shows itself to be unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that such positivity corresponds, in fact, to the infection of a person by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.‚Äù

In the eyes of this court, then, a positive test does not correspond to a Covid case. The two most important reasons for this, said the judges, are that, ‚Äúthe test‚Äôs reliability depends on the number of cycles used‚Äô‚Äô and that ‚Äúthe test‚Äôs reliability depends on the viral load present.‚Äô‚Äô In other words, there are simply too many unknowns surrounding PCR testing.

Tested positive? There could be as little as a 3% chance it‚Äôs correct

This is not the first challenge to the credibility of PCR tests. Many people will be aware that their results have a lot to do with the number of amplifications that are performed, or the ‚Äòcycle threshold.‚Äô This number in most American and European labs is 35‚Äì40 cycles, but experts have claimed that even 35 cycles is far too many, and that a more reasonable protocol would call for 25‚Äì30 cycles. (Each cycle exponentially increases the amount of viral DNA in the sample).

Earlier this year, data from three US states ‚Äì New York, Nevada and Massachusetts ‚Äì showed that when the amount of the virus found in a person was taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who tested positive could actually have been negative, as they may have been carrying only tiny amounts of the virus.

The Portuguese judges cited a study conducted by ‚Äúsome of the leading European and world specialists,‚Äù which was published by Oxford Academic at the end of September. It showed that if someone tested positive for Covid at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher, the chances of that person actually being infected is less than three percent, and that ‚Äúthe probability of‚Ä¶ receiving a false positive is 97% or higher.‚Äù

While the judges in this case admitted that the cycle threshold used in Portuguese labs was unknown, they took this as further proof that the detention of the tourists was unlawful. The implication was that the results could not be trusted. Because of this uncertainty, they stated that there was ‚Äúno way this court would ever be able to determine‚Äù whether the tourist who tested positive was indeed a carrier of the virus, or whether the others had been exposed to it.

Sshhh ‚Äì don‚Äôt tell anyone

It is a sad indictment of our mainstream media that such a landmark ruling, of such obvious and pressing international importance, has been roundly ignored. If one were making (flimsy) excuses for them, one could say that the case escaped the notice of most science editors because it has been published in Portuguese. But there is a full English translation of the appeal, and alternative media managed to pick it up.

And it isn‚Äôt as if Portugal is some remote, mysterious nation where news is unreliable or whose judges are suspect ‚Äì this is a western EU country with a large population and a similar legal system to many other parts of Europe. And it is not the only country whose institutions are clashing with received wisdom on Covid. Finland‚Äôs national health authority has disputed the WHO‚Äôs recommendation to test as many people as possible for coronavirus, saying it would be a waste of taxpayer‚Äôs money, while poorer South East Asian countries are holding off on ordering vaccines, citing an improper use of finite resources.

Testing, especially PCR testing, is the basis for the entire house of cards of Covid restrictions that are wreaking havoc worldwide. From testing comes case numbers. From case numbers come the ‚ÄòR number,‚Äô the rate at which a carrier infects others. From the ‚Äòdreaded‚Äô R number comes the lockdowns and the restrictions, such as England‚Äôs new and baffling tiered restrictions that come into force next week.

The daily barrage of statistics is familiar to us all by this point, but as time goes on the evidence that something may be deeply amiss with the whole foundation of our reaction to this pandemic ‚Äì the testing regime ‚Äì continues to mount.

298,Firm That Owns Dominion Voting Systems Received $400 Million From Swiss Bank Account Funded by Communist Chinese Gov & Companies Before Election,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

An investigation into SEC filings has revealed that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

The investigation centers on Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.

Dominion Voting Systems operates voting machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election night.

‚ÄúOn Oct 8, 2020, Staple Street Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400,000,000 with the Sales Compensation Recipient identified as UBS Securities,‚Äù states the investigation, which also notes that another payment of $200,000,000 was received in December 2014.

‚ÄúUBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co LTD, a Chinese Investment Bank. The remaining 75% of UBS Securities CO LTD is owned by the Chinese government,‚Äù states the report.

The overall owners of UBS Securities Co LTD are;

‚Äì Beijing Guoxiang (33%)

‚Äì UBS (24.99%)

‚Äì Guangdong Comm. Group [zh] (14.01%)

‚Äì China Guodian (14%)

‚Äì COFCO Group (14%)

Aside from UBS, the other four owners of UBS Securities are all Communist Chinese front groups.

Beijing Guoxiang is a state owned asset.

Guangdong Comm. Group 100% stakeholder is the Guangdong Provincial Government.

China Guodian is state owned enterprise administered for the SASAC for the state Council

COFCO Group is a state owned enterprise under the direct supervision of the SASAC.

SASAC The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) is a special commission of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, directly under the State Council.

The revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election to help Joe Biden.

Other connections between Dominion Voting Systems and the Chinese government have also emerged in recent weeks, including the company‚Äôs Core Infrastructure Manager of Information Technology, Andy Huang, who previously worked for China Telecom, which is ‚Äúwholly run by the Chinese government,‚Äù reported the National Pulse.

In her included op-ed entitled, ‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs personnel picks engender no legitimate GOP gripes‚Äù, Rubin started off shilling for a couple of Obama-era Democrats Biden reprised for his economic team, Cecilia Rouse for Council of Economic Advisers, and Janet Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve.

‚ÄúCecilia Rouse, Biden‚Äôs pick to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, drew raves from sensible conservatives,‚Äù Rubin said, citing the pro-Iraq War American Enterprise Institute (AEI).

Like Rouse, she cited AEI praising Yellen for being someone ‚Äúwho knows her way around Washington as well as around the corridors of power abroad.‚Äù

Rubin then exalted Democrat Neera Tanden, Biden‚Äôs pick for Office of Management and Budget, noting that the former Obama and Clinton underling is ‚Äúpro-capitalism.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is a card-carrying member of the pro-capitalism wing of the party,‚Äù Rubin wrote, as if that fact would reassure conservatives.

Additionally, Tanden is a rabid ‚ÄúRussia collusion‚Äù conspiracy theorist.

Rubin finished off her shill piece by lauding Biden‚Äôs ‚Äúinternationalist‚Äù foreign policy picks, former Obama and Clinton advisor Jake Sullivan and pro-China Democrat Antony Blinken, claiming their ‚Äútraditional, mainstream foreign policy‚Äù of endless wars was ‚Äúembraced by conservatives and liberals alike.‚Äù

‚ÄúLikewise, Biden‚Äôs foreign policy picks ‚Äî including Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and Antony Blinken as secretary of state, both advocates of a traditional, mainstream foreign policy ‚Äî were embraced by conservatives and liberals alike,‚Äù Rubin wrote.

‚ÄúAs pro-NATO, pro-human-rights internationalists, these appointments align much more closely with the foreign policy framework of George H.W. Bush than of isolationists on the right and left.‚Äù

Rubin added that these former Obama and Clinton officials wouldn‚Äôt hinder Biden‚Äôs far-left agenda.

‚ÄúNone of this means that the Biden administration will shy away from progressive goals, such as strengthening Obamacare, expanding green energy or pushing for police and criminal justice reform,‚Äù she noted.

In sum, Rubin thinks the Republican Party shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúgripe‚Äù about Biden‚Äôs collection of pro-endless war Obama and Clinton minions retaking control of the country for Biden to enact his far-left agenda.

President Trump gave his first interview to Fox News since Election Day to explain the ‚Äúrigged election‚Äù and how his legal team is handling the partisan courts and fake news media as they bring lawsuits to several battleground states.

Speaking on ‚ÄúSunday Morning Futures,‚Äù Trump began by slamming the lower courts for dismissing his election fraud lawsuits despite having plenty of evidence to present.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed to put in our proof. They say you don‚Äôt have standing,‚Äù Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. ‚ÄúI would like to file one nice big beautiful lawsuit, talking about this and many other things, with tremendous proof. We have affidavits, we have hundreds and hundreds of affidavits.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou mean as president of the United States, I don‚Äôt have standing? What kind of a court system is this?‚Äù Trump continued.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to put the evidence in, and the judges won‚Äôt allow us to do it,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúWe have so much evidence. You probably saw Wednesday last week we had a hearing in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania‚Ä¶Unbelievable witnesses, highly-respected people, that were truly aggrieved.‚Äù

Trump noted that if Republican lawmakers don‚Äôt fight against the unprecedented fraud brought by the Democrats, they‚Äôll never win another election again.

‚ÄúIf Republicans allow it to happen, you‚Äôll never have another Republican elected in the history of this country, at a Senate level or at a presidential level‚Ä¶or at a House level,‚Äù Trump said.

Trump also laid into the fake news media and Big Tech, who he says are purposely ‚Äúsuppressing‚Äù the election fraud developments.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression of press,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have a scandal if no one reports about it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey make it like we don‚Äôt have evidence, we have evidence all over the place,‚Äù he added.

Bottom line, he said, is that Biden did not get 80 million legal votes, and his team of lawyers intends to prove that.

‚ÄúWe won the election easily. ‚ÄòThere‚Äôs no way Biden got 80 million votes,‚Äù he said.

306,Biden Reportedly Mulls Promoting ‚ÄòTaliban Bounties Story‚Äô Congresswoman to be CIA Director,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Joe Biden began announcing picks for his cabinet this week, even as incumbent Donald Trump continues to refuse to concede, citing alleged widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, Biden selected Antony Blinken ‚Äì his former vice-presidential national security adviser and a proponent of war in Iraq, Libya and Syria ‚Äì for the key post of secretary of state.

The Biden camp is actively considering naming Democrat congresswoman for Michigan, Elissa Slotkin ‚Äì a former CIA analyst, senior Pentagon official and Iraq War intelligence operative ‚Äì as his CIA director, the New York Times has reported, citing people said to be familiar with the deliberations.

The 44-year-old New York City native is known to have served three tours of duty in Iraq as a CIA militia expert during the late Bush and early Obama administrations, and then to have gone on to work at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. In 2012, she moved to the Pentagon and, in 2015, was tapped for the role of acting secretary of defence for international security affairs.

At the Defence Department, Slotkin was involved in ramping up the scale of US military operations on Russia‚Äôs western borders, and at the same time charged with ensuring ‚Äòdeconfliction‚Äô between Russian and US military aircraft in Syria. Her responsibilities are also said to have included drone and cyber warfare, as well as homeland defence.

During her bid for Congress in 2018, the World Socialist Website named Slotkin as one of ‚ÄòThe CIA Democrats‚Äô, ie, one of a peculiarly large body of former intelligence and military personnel seeking to compete for vulnerable Republican-held seats in the mid-term elections.

Criticism of Trump

Slotkin co-authored an op-ed in The Detroit News last week urging Donald Trump to concede the election. In October, she reportedly expressed concerns that America might be ‚Äòhurtling toward‚Äô a constitutional crisis based on Trump‚Äôs allegations of plans by the Democrats to rig the election.

Slotkin has attacked Trump on a range of foreign policy matters, from his Iran policy, to his corruption probe against the Biden family‚Äôs alleged corruption in Ukraine (which she said warranted Trump‚Äôs impeachment), to what she characterised as his strange relationship with Russia.

In the summer of 2020, when the New York Times, the Washington Post and other US media reported the (since debunked) claims by ‚Äòanonymous intelligence officials‚Äô that Russia had offered the Taliban* bounties for US troops‚Äô heads, Slotkin blasted Trump over his many telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and suggested that there was ‚Äúsomething‚Ä¶ off about‚Äù the relationship between the two men ‚Äúsince the beginning,‚Äù with Americans ‚Äúquite literally paying in blood for [Trump‚Äôs] pandering to Putin‚Äù, in Afghanistan.

The White House, Russian officials and the Taliban have since dismissed the ‚Äòbounty‚Äô claims, with the militia accusing the Afghan government of deliberately seeking to derail the withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn Central Asian nation.

In October, Slotkin asked Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to brief congress on the extent of the alleged threat posed by Russia and Iran to the US election process, claiming that the Russian and Iranian efforts ‚Äúremain persistent and sadly effective in sowing distrust and division among the American people‚Äù.

Slotkin made headlines last week when she said she would not support Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs bid to be speaker of the House, briefly causing speculation about serious divisions in the Democrat Party. Pelosi handily won re-election as speaker anyway, with no one stepping up to challenge her.

Calls for a pardon for Snowden ‚Äî who remains in Russia where he fled following leaving the US after releasing classified documents in 2013 showing the government was mass-collecting citizens‚Äô personal data ‚Äî have intensified as President Donald Trump is preparing to likely leave office.

Julian Assange is facing separate espionage charges related to WikiLeaks‚Äô publication of military documents a decade ago. He is currently in a British prison awaiting a judge‚Äôs decision on whether he will be extradited to the US.

As well as Gabbard, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida), Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), and others have called for charges to be dropped against the whistleblower.

On Friday, Snowden retweeted a Twitter poll with over 78,000 respondents asking whether he should receive a pardon. Nearly 70 percent said yes, while less than 15 percent said no.

Scientist, engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and four-time Massachusetts Institute of Technology degree holder Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai delved deep into Arizona‚Äôs 2020 presidential election vote tabulation data during the state‚Äôs election integrity hearing on Monday.

Dr. Ayyadurai revealed that pattern recognition software that tried to replicate the curve of Joe Biden‚Äôs reported vote total could only match the reported results if votes for Biden were counted at a 130% rate ‚Äì in other words, every Democrat ballot counting for 1.3 votes to Trump‚Äôs 1.0.

Dr. Ayyadurai‚Äôs software tried numerous solutions to replicate the curve of Biden‚Äôs vote count in 734 Arizona precincts, and ‚Äúthe only one that we were able to come close to matching was this, and I want everyone to look at this carefully. The interesting possibility we find here is that when the Democrat percentage is 130% Mr. Biden, and -30% Mr. Trump‚Ä¶ it matches perfectly. Near perfectly. The slopes match, the curves match the shapes match.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what that tells us is that this demographic distribution of allocation of party affiliations is what can generate this, and I find it highly implausible because this means that Mr. Biden got 130% of Democrat voters, and President Trump got negative 30%,‚Äù Dr. Ayyadurai stated.

Dr. Ayyadurai found that there were two possibilities for such an implausible descrepancy: either there was a niche demographic of Independent Biden voters that existed beyond the computer model‚Äôs ability to replicate the curve, or Biden‚Äôs votes were multiplied by 1.3 (130%).

In the latter scenario, President Trump‚Äôs vote totals would have to be reduced by 30% in accordance with the 130% gained by Biden, a scenario could only occur through swapping preexisting votes between the two candidates.

You are supposed to deliver the USB drive, not plug it into an external laptop and manipulate it in the file explorer before palming it‚Ä¶ The machines should not be connected in any way. The fact that he plugged the Election Management System data into an external laptop and manipulated it in the file explorer before palming is enough to consider the entire election in that county to be compromised.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve funded a team of hackers and cybersleuths, other people with odd skills,‚Äù Byrne told One America News.

Byrne says he‚Äôs been communicating with former Trump attorney Sidney Powell for weeks ‚Äì who last week filed two lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia alleging massive schemes to rig the election for Joe Biden.

According to Powell‚Äôs Georgia lawsuit: ‚ÄúOld-fashioned ballot-stuffing‚Äù has been ‚Äúamplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software created and run by domestic and foreign actors for that very purpose,‚Äù adding that ‚ÄúMathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia.‚Äù

In Michigan, Powell claims that ‚Äúhundreds of thousands of illegal, ineligible, duplicate, or purely fictitious ballots‚Äù enabled by ‚Äúmassive election fraud‚Äù facilitated Biden‚Äôs win in the state.

The suit claimed that election software and hardware from Dominion Voting Systems used by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers helped facilitate the fraud.

More via Natural News:

Speaking to Christopher McDonald of The McFiles in a recent interview, the former head of a $200 billion e-commerce company that has never once gotten hacked revealed that Dominion Voting Systems were used to perform a ‚ÄúDrop and Roll‚Äù technique of voter fraud that slyly padded the vote for Biden in at least five key swing areas of the country.

Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Maricopa County, Arizona (Phoenix) were all rigged prior to election day to strip President Trump of his rightful win in each of these states. Byrne also mentioned Clark County, Nevada (Las Vegas) as another election fraud locale, though this one was more secondary.

According to Byrne, who is not a supporter of President Trump but rather a ‚Äúsmall l‚Äù libertarian, these five (or six if you include Clark County) areas are where a bulk of the election fraud took place. It did not have to be widespread because these were the key swing areas that Biden needed to ‚Äúwin‚Äù in order to steal the election.

‚ÄúBy cheating those five counties, you flip five key states, you flip the electoral college,‚Äù Byrne says. ‚ÄúIn places where Trump lost by 10,000, there may be 300,000 fake, illegal votes for Biden. So this isn‚Äôt even close.‚Äù

Water is considered to be the basis of life. On Mars, however, much of it is frozen and the rest is full of salt from the Martian soil, making it useless for NASA astronauts who are to land on the red planet by 2033 to ‚Äúlearn how to live and work in another world.‚Äù

Salty water is impossible to drink and so salt removal is obligatory, notably using methods of breaking water into oxygen and hydrogen, the process is extremely complex and costly. The possibility of obtaining oxygen and hydrogen out of briny water would make the process much easier and cheaper.

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), on Monday published research into a new system, developed by the engineers at Washington University in St. Louis, that can directly coerce the elements out of unusable salty water.

The research team, led by Vijay Ramani, Roma B. and Raymond H. Wittcoff, examined the system both in terrestrial conditions and in a simulated Martian atmosphere of -33 ‚Å∞F (-36 ‚Å∞C).

‚ÄúOur Martian brine electrolyzer radically changes the logistical calculus of missions to Mars and beyond,‚Äù said Ramani. ‚ÄúThis technology is equally useful on Earth where it opens up the oceans as a viable oxygen and fuel source.‚Äù

This technology will provide an additional pathway to help NASA accomplish its mission of landing humans on Mars by 2033. Perchlorate brine electrolyzers are more efficient than the current state-of-the-art alkaline water electrolyzers under terrestrial conditions that provide a route to use suboptimal input to produce ultrapure hydrogen and oxygen, according to PNAS.

Future astronauts will need to manufacture water to live on the red planet, as well as the fuel necessary for their trip home. The system developed in Ramani‚Äôs lab can produce both, without the need for heating or purifying a water source.

‚ÄúParadoxically, the dissolved perchlorate in the water, so-called impurities, actually help in an environment like that of Mars,‚Äù said Shrihari Sankarasubramanian, a research scientist in Ramani‚Äôs group and a joint author of the paper.

The fact that the new system can work with ‚Äúsub-optimal‚Äù, or salty, water can significantly lower the cost of electrolysis devices everywhere, including on Earth.

The Ramani team expects to join forces with NASA to further develop the system and also hope that it will be used to help divers explore uncharted environments in the deep sea. ‚ÄòHaving demonstrated these electrolyzers under demanding Martian conditions, we intend to also deploy them under much milder conditions on Earth to utilize brackish or salt water feeds to produce hydrogen and oxygen, for example through seawater electrolysis‚Äô, said Pralay Gayen, a research team associate.

In 2019 NASA announced that intended to send astronauts to Mars by 2033. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology that the Mars landing could be moved up by moving up the moon landing.

‚ÄúWe need to learn how to live and work in another world. The moon is the best place to prove those capabilities and technologies. The sooner we can achieve that objective, the sooner we can move on to Mars‚Äù, Bridenstine said on April 2, 2019.

319,New Hubble Data Explains Missing Dark Matter,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

In 2018 an international team of researchers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and several other observatories uncovered, for the first time, a galaxy in our cosmic neighborhood that is missing most of its dark matter.

This discovery of the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 was a surprise to astronomers, as it was understood that dark matter is a key constituent in current models of galaxy formation and evolution.

In fact, without the presence of dark matter, the primordial gas would lack enough gravitational pull to start collapsing and forming new galaxies. A year later, another galaxy that misses dark matter was discovered, NGC 1052-DF4, which further triggered intense debates among astronomers about the nature of these objects.

Now, new Hubble data have been used to explain the reason behind the missing dark matter in NGC 1052-DF4, which resides 45 million light-years away.

Mireia Montes of the University of New South Wales in Australia led an international team of astronomers to study the galaxy using deep optical imaging. They discovered that the missing dark matter can be explained by the effects of tidal disruption.

The gravity forces of the neighboring massive galaxy NGC 1035 are tearing NGC 1052-DF4 apart.

During this process, the dark matter is removed, while the stars feel the effects of the interaction with another galaxy at a later stage.

Until now, the removal of dark matter in this way has remained hidden from astronomers as it can only be observed using extremely deep images that can reveal extremely faint features. ‚ÄúWe used Hubble in two ways to discover that NGC 1052-DF4 is experiencing an interaction,‚Äù explained Montes. ‚ÄúThis includes studying the galaxy‚Äôs light and the galaxy‚Äôs distribution of globular clusters.‚Äù

Thanks to Hubble‚Äôs high resolution, the astronomers could identify the galaxy‚Äôs globular cluster population. The 10.4-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) telescope and the IAC80 telescope in the Canary Islands of Spain were also used to complement Hubble‚Äôs observations by further studying the data.

‚ÄúIt is not enough just to spend a lot of time observing the object, but a careful treatment of the data is vital,‚Äù explained team member Ra√∫l Infante-Sainz of the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias in Spain. ‚ÄúIt was therefore important that we use not just one telescope/instrument, but several (both ground- and space-based) to conduct this research. With the high resolution of Hubble, we can identify the globular clusters, and then with GTC photometry we obtain the physical properties.‚Äù

Globular clusters are thought to form in the episodes of intense star formation that shaped galaxies. Their compact sizes and luminosity make them easily observable, and they are therefore good tracers of the properties of their host galaxy. In this way, by studying and characterizing the spatial distribution of the clusters in NGC 1052-DF4, astronomers can develop insight into the present state of the galaxy itself. The alignment of these clusters suggests they are being ‚Äústripped‚Äù from their host galaxy, and this supports the conclusion that tidal disruption is occurring.

By studying the galaxy‚Äôs light, the astronomers also found evidence of tidal tails, which are formed of material moving away from NGC 1052-DF4. This further supports the conclusion that this is a disruption event. Additional analysis concluded that the central parts of the galaxy remain untouched and only about 7% of the stellar mass of the galaxy is hosted in these tidal tails. This means that dark matter, which is less concentrated than stars, was previously and preferentially stripped from the galaxy, and now the outer stellar component is starting to be stripped as well.

‚ÄúThis result is a good indicator that, while the dark matter of the galaxy was evaporated from the system, the stars are only now starting to suffer the disruption mechanism,‚Äù explained team member Ignacio Trujillo of the Instituto de Astrof√≠sica de Canarias in Spain. ‚ÄúIn time, NGC 1052-DF4 will be cannibalized by the large system around NGC 1035, with at least some of their stars floating free in deep space.‚Äù

The discovery of evidence to support the mechanism of tidal disruption as the explanation for the galaxy‚Äôs missing dark matter has not only solved an astronomical conundrum, but has also brought a sigh of relief to astronomers. Without it, scientists would be faced with having to revise our understanding of the laws of gravity.

‚ÄúThis discovery reconciles existing knowledge of how galaxies form and evolve with the most favorable cosmological model,‚Äù added Montes.

320,New Instrument Hunts for Ancient Metal in Space,[],"Researchers created a new astronomical instrument that has successfully aided in estimating the abundance of metals in the early universe.

The WINERED instrument allows for better observations of astronomical bodies like quasars in the early universe, billions of years ago.

Researchers hope this deeper level of exploration could help answer questions about the origins not only of metals in the universe but also of the stars themselves.

Iron is one of the most important elements for life as we know it, and for the technology, both primitive and modern, that has shaped human history. But details of the exact origin of iron and other important metals such as magnesium remain elusive. Exploration of this is important in the field of astronomy as it also connected to the origins of the first stars that would have begun to shine several hundred million years after the Big Bang.

Project Research Associate Hiroaki Sameshima from the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo and his team decided a new instrument was needed to study these matters. Due to limited instrumentation, previous observations to collect data for the study of metals‚Äô origins mainly looked at old stars nearby. But this only gave astronomers information about our own unique galaxy. A new instrument with enhanced sensitivity to near-infrared light could push the boundary and open up observations of distant quasars, ferociously energetic ancient galactic cores that emitted light when the universe was only 2.4 billion years old.

‚ÄúBy mounting the WINERED instrument on a large telescope, we can see further back in time as we can observe bodies more distant, or more ancient, than those from previous studies. We can now see details of quasars over 10 billion years old,‚Äù said Sameshima. ‚ÄúWINERED is a special kind of spectrograph, which can read the chemical signatures present in the light from distant bodies. It revealed to us the fingerprints of iron and magnesium in the light from these quasars, and this allowed us to calculate the abundance of these elements when the universe was much younger than previous studies allowed.‚Äù

Now that the researchers have established a new method to directly examine the abundance of metals in the early universe, the challenge becomes one of refining the technique and broadening its scope to collect more data. With improved data, astronomers can build on this study and create theories to explain the origins of metals including the iron in your blood.

324,Trump Says Big Tech Immunities Must Be Terminated for ‚ÄòNational Security‚Äô Reasons,[],"President Trump posted to Twitter late Thursday evening his call for the ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù termination of Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act, declaring that the liability protections of Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter should be stripped for ‚Äúpurposes of national security.‚Äù

For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

Currently, Big Tech companies claim they act as a neutral platform, meaning that they receive certain protections from what people post on their site under Section 230, which gives them a ‚Äúliability shield.‚Äù However, given that they have engaged in the censorship of conservatives, they act more like a publisher, who is more liable for what is on their site.

The announcement followed a tweet from President Trump that attacked Twitter for ‚Äúsending out totally false ‚ÄòTrends‚Äô that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world.‚Äù He argued that the trends are simply made up, and they are only ‚Äúnegative‚Äù ones. ‚ÄúSame thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to Fox News daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination!‚Äù the President concluded.

Twitter is sending out totally false ‚ÄúTrends‚Äù that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. They make it up, and only negative ‚Äústuff‚Äù. Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to @FoxNews daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

This is not the first time that the President has called for the end of Section 230. Last month, after Facebook and Twitter removed a story from the New York post about emails between Joe Biden and his son Hunter, he also called for the repeal of Section 230. However, this is the first time that the call has been made to do it ‚Äúimmediately,‚Äù and also the first time ‚Äúnational security‚Äù has been posited as a reason for doing so.

So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of ‚ÄúSmoking Gun‚Äù emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician. REPEAL SECTION 230!!! https://t.co/g1RJFpIVUZ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2020

The President‚Äôs actions may have had something to do with the behaviour of Big Tech over the course of this election. Throughout the election, a large quantity of the President‚Äôs tweets and other social media postings, along with those of many of his supporters, have been labelled as misinformation, with Tucker Carlson even arguing that Big Tech rigged the election in favour of Joe Biden ‚Äúin plain sight.‚Äù

Only this week, the personal Twitter account of Pennsylvania state Senator Doug Mastriano was banned, after the Senator had organised a hearing in his state‚Äôs legislature about the vast irregularities that took place in this month‚Äôs presidential election.

In May this year, the President signed an executive order that would strip the liability shield away from Big Tech companies if they engaged in ‚Äúcensoring or any political conduct.‚Äù As National File reported:

The executive order also instructs Attorney General William Barr to work with the states to develop their own legislation regarding censorship online, and also instructs his adminstration to start developing policies to ‚Äúensure taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media that suppresses free speech. The President noted that Big Tech companies have had ‚Äúunchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter, virtually any communication between private citizens and large public audiences.‚Äù",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keep up to date with our latest:

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove contradicted his own government‚Äôs vaccine minister by asserting that there were no plans to issue ‚Äòvaccination passports‚Äô that would be required before people were allowed to enter bars, restaurants and other venues.

As we highlighted yesterday, during an interview on BBC Radio, UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested that the NHS ‚Äòtrack and trace‚Äô app would be used to digitally store information about whether a person has been inoculated or not.

‚ÄúI think you‚Äôll find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, football stadiums, will probably also use that system,‚Äù said Zahawi.

With airlines also suggesting they will adopt the system, this creates the prospect of millions of people who refuse to take the vaccine being prevented from being able to travel or engage in basic social activities.

However, in an interview with Sky News earlier today, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said no such plans were being considered.

""I certainly am not planning to issue any vaccine passports and i don't know anyone else in government who would.""@michaelgove tells @kayburley there will not be a #COVID19 vaccine passport.#KayBurley https://t.co/UV70Cs1n0C pic.twitter.com/mVAnfR7ttK ‚Äî Sky News (@SkyNews) December 1, 2020

‚ÄúPeople in this country have common sense, the overwhelming majority can see that getting vaccinated is not just good for you, it‚Äôs also good for others, it‚Äôs a way of making sure that granny and grandad, mum and dad are safe,‚Äù said Gove.

Asked if there would be a vaccine passport, Gove responded, ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not being planned.‚Äù

‚ÄúI certainly am not planning to issue any vaccine passports and I don‚Äôt know anyone else in government who would,‚Äù he added.

However, as we have previously discussed, service providers and companies could still require proof of vaccination outside any government involvement, potentially using technology like the ‚ÄòCommon Pass‚Äô being developed by the World Economic Forum.

The British government has mobilised an elite ‚Äúinformation warfare‚Äù unit to combat ‚Äúanti-vaccine militants‚Äù and interrupt their ‚Äúpropaganda content‚Äù online, according to a report in The Sunday Times.

The report (behind a paywall) says that the unit is usually used to assist with operations against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, but now will be turned on to those who dare question the sanctity of COVID vaccination.

The report further notes that the outfit known as ‚ÄòThe defence cultural specialist unit‚Äô was formed in Afghanistan in 2010 and is part of the army‚Äôs 77th Brigade.

‚ÄúThe secretive unit has often worked side-by-side with psychological operations teams,‚Äù the report adds.

Nice‚Ä¶ The government employing the military to use psyops on the public to ensure no one strays from the acceptable opinion on the vaccine.



How is OperationWarpSpeed like Mickey‚Äôs Sorcerer‚Äôs Apprentice? Is the mRNA vaccine messing with something they can‚Äôt control? OWS is exactly what Bill Gates ordered with IA2030. Instead of $20 BILLION to build a wall, instead of military protecting US border, we have $20B for an untested experimental vaccine run by and delivered by the military.

The Times claims that the move was revealed by ‚Äòleaked‚Äô documents‚Äô.

‚ÄúSoldiers are already monitoring cyberspace for Covid-19 content and analysing how British citizens are being targeted online,‚Äù it claims.

Of course, the government claims that muh Russians are involved‚Ä¶ a way of confusing people into accepting the enforcement of group think by military spies.

‚ÄúIt is also gathering evidence of vaccine disinformation from hostile states, including Russia,‚Äù the report states.

Exactly what constitutes vaccine ‚Äúdisinformation‚Äù will be down to the government, and will likely make a target of anyone who points out potential side effects of vaccination, or questions the idea of mandating the jab, whether literally by law or by making it impossible to participate in society without it.

After the ‚Äòleak‚Äô came to light, the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that the unit is ‚Äúnot being directed at the UK population,‚Äù only at ‚Äòhostile foreign actors‚Äô.

Yeah, OK.

Just like the GCHQ spook unit inside 10 Downing Street is also not targeted at the public.

A fortnight ago it was revealed by The London Telegraph (Paywall) that spies from Britain‚Äôs most secretive intelligence and security organisation have embedded a ‚Äòcell‚Äô at the heart of government to provide Prime Minister Boris Johnson with real time information pertaining to the public‚Äôs movements.

Words we didn't expect to read in 2020:

Speaking anonymously to the London Times in November, a source noted that ‚ÄúGCHQ has been told to take out antivaxers online and on social media. There are ways they have used to monitor and disrupt terrorist propaganda.‚Äù

Keep up to date with our latest:

The head of the Red Cross has warned that the spread of ‚Äúfake news‚Äù concerning vaccines could cause a ‚Äúsecond pandemic‚Äù.

German news agency Deutsche Welle reports that Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, commented during a virtual round table discussion that there is a ‚Äúparallel pandemic of distrust‚Äù that needs to be defeated.

The report notes that Rocca warned of a ‚Äúgrowing hesitancy‚Äù globally toward vaccines, noting that ‚Äúa vaccine in-and-of-itself will not be enough to end this pandemic.‚Äù

Rocca also asserted that the lack of trust in vaccines ‚Äúis by no means a Western phenomenon,‚Äù further noting that ‚ÄúIn several African countries, we have seen a common skepticism towards vaccines in general, with a common belief being that foreigners use Africa as a medical `testing ground.‚Äù‚Äò

‚ÄúWe believe that the massive, coordinated efforts that will be needed to roll out the COVID vaccine in an equitable manner need to be paralleled by equally massive efforts to proactively build and maintain trust,‚Äù Rocca said.

‚ÄúWe stand ready to support government efforts to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine, including by leading and supporting efforts to counteract misinformation and build trust,‚Äù Rocca added.

A John Hopkins study is taken down after it says COVID is no big deal and deaths are misattributed to COVID. And, CDC shows that 90% of people sick enough to be hospitalized still recover (in spite of medical negligence).

Rocca warned against the rise of ‚Äúvaccine nationalism‚Äù, a concern previously posited by Bill Gates that not everyone in the world will be given access to a COVID vaccine.

Rocca called for a globally coordinated effort to vaccinate everyone via a program known as the COVAX facility.

‚ÄúWe call again on all the governments who have not joined the COVAX facility to consider doing so and to show leadership at theinternational level. We also call on governments who have joined the COVAX facility to increase their allocation to this valuable multilateral mechanism to further increase equity in future vaccine distribution,‚Äù the Red Cross head said.

‚ÄúThe vaccine must go to where it is needed, not just to where it can be afforded,‚Äù Rocca added.

The comments come amid concerns that the vaccines will be made mandatory all over the world, either by law or by means of social coercion.

The UK government has today scrambled to clarify remarks made Monday by UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, indicating that so called ‚Äúimmunity passports‚Äù may be required by bars, restaurants, cinemas and stadiums for people to enter.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove denied that the government is planning to implement such a scheme, but admitted that ‚ÄúOf course, individual businesses have the capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why.‚Äù",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zahawi went on to explain that the NHS‚Äô ‚Äòtrack and trace‚Äô app, the use of which was implemented as a requirement to enter bars and restaurants, had set the pretext for the vaccine eventually being made mandatory to enter such venues.

In Day 2 as Vaccine Minister, @nadhimzahawi endorses the NHS App morphing into an immunity passport.

The host responded by clarifying that ‚Äúit would become virtually impossible to do anything if you don‚Äôt have the vaccine.‚Äù

The comment once again highlights how governments don‚Äôt need to make the vaccine compulsory by law, they will simply lean on the travel, leisure and entertainment industry to make life virtually impossible for those who refuse to take it.

By setting the benchmark that virtually any social activity will require people to take the shot, those who refuse will essentially be confined to a form of lockdown for potentially the rest of their lives.

333,Killing The Future: COVID Madness Will Lead To HALF A MILLION Fewer U.S. Births In 2021,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Research has concluded that the US will experience 500,000 fewer births in 2021, as couples choose not to have children because of the coronavirus fallout.

The findings by the Brookings Institute were published last week in the Wall Street Journal, which noted that there will be ‚Äúbetween 300,000 to 500,000 fewer births in the U.S. next year, compared with a drop of 44,172 last year.‚Äù

The numbers equate to a 13% drop from the 3.8 million babies born in 2019.

The ‚Äúanalysis, partly based on what happened following the 2007-2009 recession, is that weaker job prospects equate to fewer births,‚Äù the report further notes.

‚ÄúWomen will have many fewer babies in the short term, and for some of them, a lower total number of children over their lifetimes,‚Äù the research, previously previewed in the Summer, noted.

The US birthrate is already at its lowest level on record, and according to clinics, there has been a 50% jump in requests for birth control since the beginning of the pandemic, and a 40% increase in requests for Plan B.

CDC research notes that the birth rate in the US has been below replacement level since 1971. It is now a problem across all major racial groups including Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic Asians. All have below replacement birth levels.

A recent survey from the Guttmacher Institute discovered that 34% of women able to have babies in the US have made a decision to either delay having a child, or to just have fewer children because of COIVD.

Analysts say this will have a long and profound impact on the economy for many years to come, as the US could be falling into a so called ‚ÄòFertility trap‚Äô where there are fewer women around to have babies, resulting in smaller families, and low population growth reducing economic growth.

All of this results in increased pessimism and a downward spiral that is difficult to break.

Major scientists in the medical and pharmaceutical community are coming out now in denial of the hoax, and Alex Jones is here to listen to them.

It will also mean that in the near future there will be a huge mismatch between the amounts of younger and older people in the country.

After breakfast, you'll visit Titanic Belfast, which stands on the site where RMS Titanic was constructed over a century ago. Developed as much as a tribute to the days of shipbuilding in the city as in commemoration of the ill-fated liner that met her untimely end on her Maiden Voyage in 1912, Titanic Belfast is a dramatic, innovative and exciting presentation of the real story of the famous ship. Wander through its nine fascinating galleries, housed in one of the most eye-catching buildings to have been built in the UK for years.

After a fascinating morning and the opportunity to enjoy lunch (payable locally) this afternoon's guided tour of Belfast will reveal the city's turbulent past, thriving present and hopes for the future. Highlights will include major landmarks such as City Hall, Queen's and Stormont Castle - seat of the Northern Ireland Assembly and a stunning sight gradually revealed from the rising approach road. During the tour you'll also see West Belfast's celebrated Peace Wall, the political murals of the Shankhill and Falls roads, and the ultra-modern developments of the regenerated docks area, crowned by the breathtaking Titanic Quarter.

After breakfast, join your tour manager and board the coach for the journey through Snowdonia National Park to the Welsh island of Anglesey. Stop at Plas Newydd, home of the Marquess of Anglesey.

Enjoy a stroll around the gardens and grounds as you learn more about the history of the house before the tour continues to the captivating seaside town of Beaumaris, at the eastern end of the Menai Strait. Beaumaris‚Äô UNESCO-listed castle dates back to the 13th century, when Edward I ordered its construction as part of his campaign to conquer Wales. However, construction of the castle was abandoned in the early 14th century when resources were diverted toward the invasion of Scotland. The unfinished castle was then occupied by the Welsh, and taken back by the English, and then reoccupied by forces loyal to Charles I during the English Civil War. Today, the castle remains as it was then: an unfinished masterpiece of near complete symmetry. The tour manager will bring the castle‚Äôs fascinating history to life, regaling you with tales stretching back the best part of a thousand years. Enjoy some free time for lunch in the town (payable locally) before continuing across the Menai Suspension Bridge to Caernarfon, on the Welsh mainland.

You‚Äôll start at 4 am this morning (early by anyone‚Äôs standards), clambering over rocky paths as vegetation thins out with the ever-increasing altitude. There are long sections of scree, and the climb becomes challenging because of the loose rock. Once you pass the 4,000m point, there are magnificent panoramic views across the valleys and lower summits of the High Atlas Range. The feeling of achievement you‚Äôll get at the top is monumental. To the north, you‚Äôll see the fertile plains of the Magreb and Marrakech, and to the south, the wild landscape of the pre-Sahara.

Continuing upwards to the village of Resera, the panoramic views open up with sweeping vineyards below. Then comes the welcome descent, freewheeling down to the shores of Revine Lake for a picnic and well-earned rest. The rest of the ride is leisurely, following flat cycle paths and roads back to Pieve di Soligo.

350,Mt Toubkal Long Weekend - Winter,[],"Mt Toubkal, you tricky customer

With our 50th birthdays looming, a few friends decided to take on a challenge. Onto the Exodus website we went... All 4 of us are fairly fit so decided a ""challenging"" level would be just the ticket! Mt Toubkal did not disappoint! It was definitely a challenge! Who knew it could rain and snow so much in August? Because we followed the trip notes, universal packing and read some reviews, we believed we were ready! We just didn't account for the altitude sickness! This took 3 of us out and only one of us made it to the summit.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip? For me, it was the summit and just before! The hours before the summit were extremely difficult as you are hiking in the dark with just a head torch, following the boots of the person in front. It was steep, raining/hailing so it was slow going. When we stopped just shy of the summit, we witnessed the most amazing sight: A rainbow over the High Atlas Mountains! It was worth all the rain to see this sight. After waking up at 330am, hiking for 4+ hours, the summit was a sight to behold! (even if it was snowing in August... in Morocco... yes, snow in August!)

What did you think of your group leader? Ilyas our group leader and Abdul his assistant were amazing!!! With 3 of my friends ill with altitude sickness, Abdul took incredible care of them. Both Ilyas and Abdul have a great sense of humour and made us all laugh. After 2 days we understood ""Ilyas time"" (ie 5 min in our time is 10 in Ilyas time) and his love of telling time in seconds! Ilyas organised our day well and I now miss someone telling me when to wake up, when to eat and when to start walking! They both gave us a great insight into Moroccan culture and the religion of Islam. I have left knowing I will have a ""home away from home"" in Morocco! Ilyas also organised tours and spa visits on our last day in Marrakesh. He was great!!

Do you have any advice for potential travellers? Be prepared! Be fit! It is definitely NOT a walk in the park. Pack for all weathers including a rain cover for your day pack or at least a dry bag for inside the pack. Also I found sticks a must for descending. And have a head torch, not just a hand held torch because you need your hands to clamber over large rocks ets (also bring extra batteries just in case). Because you start and finish the summit ascent at the refuge, make sure you have clean dry WARM clothes ready for your return to the refuge. Drinks are not served with dinner at the refuge so make sure you have money to buy a drink from the shop or have a bottle of water ready. Also make sure you have dirham change for the hike as you stop at various places to buy juices on the way to the refuge. They won't take big denominations of dirham. Also, its best to have EUROs or Dirhams. Not many places were happy with ¬£ or USD.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many, today‚Äôs visit to Vienna will be one of the highlights of the cruise. The city‚Äôs very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city‚Äôs most iconic monument is the breathtaking Saint Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral, whose striking multi-coloured roof and huge Gothic South Tower dominate the skyline. There‚Äôs also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School, and where the Vienna Boys‚Äô Choir performs. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire, including, allegedly, the sabre of Charlemagne himself. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, which contains the world‚Äôs fourth largest collection of paintings, is just across the road. This morning we have a tour with a local guide offering insights into why Vienna is one of Europe‚Äôs great capitals ‚Äì the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world‚Äôs finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and, of course, a whole family of Strausses. During the afternoon you‚Äôre free to explore as you wish. Take a stroll in the Prater, notable for the huge Ferris wheel that features in several Cold War spy thrillers. Or, for something quite different, visit the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, a former royal residence now housing a range of world-class museums and galleries. Perhaps, though, just take a stroll through Vienna‚Äôs atmospheric side streets, or enjoy a coffee and a slice of delicious Sachertorte in one of the lovely coffee houses. This evening we‚Äôve arranged truly the ‚Äòicing on the cake‚Äô: no visit to Vienna is complete without a live musical experience, so after dinner we have a classical recital on board.

Porto is of course synonymous with wonderful port wine and all the famous port producers are here, such as C√°lem, Sandeman and Ferreira, so a visit here would not be complete without a tour of one of them.

Port is made from grapes still pressed in the traditional way ‚Äì by feet ‚Äì then lovingly matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you‚Äôll get the chance to sample various port styles at the end of our visit. After lunch on board we enjoy a guided tour of Porto. Strategically overlooking the Douro as it empties into the Atlantic, Portugal‚Äôs second largest city was originally a Roman town, but its wealth derived from its knowledge of the sea routes to India, with fortunes made from trading spices, silks and other fine goods. Our tour unveils some of its major and more surprising sights. You‚Äôll have the rest of the afternoon to explore the truly fascinating city; so perhaps return to the terraced streets of the old town and wander the sloping maze of winding, cobbled alleyways, soaking up the atmosphere whilst stopping to admire the lovely architecture, soaring bell towers, fine baroque churches, golden rooftops and beautiful tiles of this slice of traditional Portugal. Stop for a drink in a cosy caf√© and be tempted by an array of delicious cakes and pastries ‚Äì perhaps sample a pastel de nata, the traditional Portuguese custard tart. This evening, enjoy a final dinner on board expertly served by our restaurant staff under the supervision of the ma√Ætre d‚Äô. Afterwards, perhaps settle into the lounge to chat into the evening and reflect on the splendours of the remarkable River Douro ‚Äì over a glass of port, of course.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Awaken early to pay a second visit to the Taj Mahal, watching the sun rise over it from across the Yamuna River. We'll return to the hotel for breakfast, and then leave Agra behind as we head to Abhaneri. This ancient village is home to Chand Baori, one of the oldest and most intricate stepwells in India, its 13 storeys and 3500 steps offering access to water and much-needed refuge from the sun's heat. After lunch at the sumptuous Umaid Lake Palace heritage hotel, we'll continue to Ranthambhore National Park. This former royal hunting ground is now a key centre for Project Tiger, and its grasslands, streams and beautiful pools are home to striped hyenas, sambar deer, sloth bears and of course tigers. This evening, prior to tomorrow's adventures, enjoy a tiger talk from a local naturalist.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
358,Highlights of Northern India - Summer itinerary,[],"The Taj Mahal was so impressive - it really is worth seeing it in real life. Pictures and TV can't do it justice. The whole trip was worth it just for that. Seeing a tiger in Rathambhore was thrilling especially as many groups aren't that lucky (but the safaris are worthwhile and enjoyable in their own right even if no tigers appear). Varanasi was fascinating and an unexpected highlight for me. Also visiting the Sikh Gurdwara and its communal kitchens in Delhi was a really interesting trip and gave an insight into an aspect of a religion I knew little about.

Do you have any advice for potential travellers?

It really does get very cold in February, particularly on the game drives and sunrise starts. You can't wear enough on the early morning safari to keep warm. So pack accordingly! Layers are best as later in the day when the sun's out you won't need your jackets. Most days you have access to a bus so can leave things like coats. European plug adaptors are the most useful to take and can be used in the majority of the hotels. The train does have power points by the bunks. You can purchase a chain and padlock to secure your bags on the train very cheaply at the station - so if you don't already have one, don't splash out in your home country on one. As with all Exodus trips, a softer, smaller bag will serve you better than a big hard suitcase, particularly when trying to fit it under the train bunk beds. There are a number of optional excursions and these aren't always listed in the trip notes. The cost was generally around 1000-1500 rupees per person for a group of 16. It would be higher for smaller groups. The excursions offered were a cooking demonstration on the first evening, a hot air balloon ride on the second morning (this would be more expensive than the cost above), watching a Bollywood film at a local cinema on the second night (this was about 700 rupees and was well worth it, really enjoyable), a sunrise cruise on the river in Varanasi to see the burning ghats (highly highly recommended), a trip to Sarnath on the second day in Varanasi (miss-able, but does pass the time if you don't want to wait around at the hotel), and a sightseeing trip in Delhi on the last day. You won't necessarily see the standard sights on the Delhi trip but the places we went were well worth visiting, especially the Gurdwara. If you do all the trips and eat with the group, you need at least ¬£200 spending money. The shopping trips can't really be avoided despite what the trip notes say as they are done 'en route' to other things, although you can opt to stay on the bus if you prefer. Take a kindle or phone or something else to amuse yourself if that's the case. The items you see are all high-price and outside the budget of some travellers, so if you're going to have to watch your money and find temptation hard to resist, you might also want to sit these out. If you're a keen photographer or historian, planning ahead for your visits is a good idea as you'll get very little time at some of the sights - in particular, those in Jaipur, and Fatephur Sikri. Reading up in advance will help you make the most of the time you get and ensure you don't miss anything you particularly wanted to see/photograph.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
359,Croatia‚Äôs white wine and white beaches: a vineyard tour of Korƒçula,[],"At 10.30am, I thought it might have been a bit early for a wine tasting. But the eight people sitting in the cool stone tasting room at Bire Winery were already having a merry time of it. I had just cycled uphill from the seafront at Lumbarda, one of Korƒçula‚Äôs main wine villages, and had to stop myself from gulping down the proffered glass of chilled ros√©. Fresh, pale and dry, it was the best I‚Äôd tasted outside of Provence.

It was an excellent prelude to the wine I had come to Croatia to taste: dry white grk, made from a grape grown nowhere else in the world. To add to its oddity, it‚Äôs female only, so it needs another grape to pollinate it. Step forward plavac mali, the full-bodied red that‚Äôs found around Dalmatia and also goes into Bire‚Äôs moreish ros√©.

They‚Äôve been making wine in Lumbarda for 2,000 years, and the wineries I was visiting were small concerns that have been in the family for anything from 200 to 600 years. From Bire I cycled past olive groves to Zure Winery, where Ivan and Marko Batistiƒá have developed a sparkling grk, the first on the island, along with a bold red (Rebellion) that blends plavac mali with four other varieties.

He also does a grk version of the Croatian dessert wine pro≈°ek, that‚Äôs a bit like Hungarian tokaj. All of these exquisite wines went beautifully with plates of octopus, local cheeses and smoked ham made from the family‚Äôs pigs ‚Äì a tantalising taste of what is offered in Zure‚Äôs vine-covered restaurant.

Grk thrives in the sandy soil of Lumbarda. And it‚Äôs sand, along with wine, that draws many to Lumbarda, as it has that rare thing on Croatia‚Äôs beautiful but rocky coast: sandy beaches. Two of them. Three if you count the narrow strip in the village opposite my hotel, the exceptionally friendly Hotel Borik. The hotel‚Äôs flower-filled terrace and its swimming pool were serene spots from which to take in views of the harbour. It was also within a short distance of the beaches and vineyards, whether you were on two wheels or two feet.

Bilin ≈Ωal and Pr≈æina beaches top and tail one of the island‚Äôs narrowest points, with a sea of vineyards dividing the two. Personally, I preferred the pebbly Tatinja beach, where I could float in clear waters while paddleboarders and kayakers passed me on their way to the little islands of Vrnik and Gubavac.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vineyards at Lumbarda. Photograph: Adam Batterbee

‚ÄúI never go into the sea,‚Äù Stjepan Cebalo told me. His Popiƒá winery is one of the three biggest in Lumbarda, along with Bire and Zure (the village has seven). We sat on his covered terrace gazing at the sea, his vineyards, terracotta-roofed houses, the white spire of Sveti Rok church and the stark mountains and vineyards of the Pelje≈°ac peninsula beyond. The sea breeze was delicious on this 30C day. Like the Bire and Zure winery owners, Stjepan has sons who are happy to carry on the family business, bucking the trend of the rural desertification of other parts of Croatia. I was already wondering what on earth would make people want to leave this place.

Swapping my bike for a scooter, I nipped over to Korƒçula Town, 6.5km away. Its fishbone-shaped medieval old town was busy with day-trippers and people from small cruise ships and yachts. Many were swept along the Marco Polo trail that sprang up around the belief that the Venetian explorer was born in Korƒçula. I gave the Marco Polo Museum a miss and instead wandered through alleys of pale stone houses, stopping for a sublime lunch of seafood pasta on the waterfront terrace of the Le≈°iƒç Dimitri Palace hotel.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pupnatska Luka beach. Photograph: Simeone Huber/Getty Images

With motorised wheels, I headed into Korƒçula‚Äôs mountainous and thickly forested interior. As I got closer to the wine-growing villages of ƒåara and Smokvica, the road swooped into valleys covered in vineyards of po≈°ip (a more floral white wine than grk) and plavac mali. Korƒçula‚Äôs heavily indented southern coast shelters gorgeous little pebbly beaches, including a secluded one at ≈Ωitna and a larger, deeper bay at Pupnatska Luka.

Back in Lumbarda, the village was gearing up for its Friday fish festival, held weekly in summer. Fishermen and women set up grills in the square opposite the little village beach, and we all queued up for freshly grilled snapper, sardines and squid.

Someone lit a bonfire on the beach, and small children, teenagers and quite a few adults joined in a tradition of jumping over the fire. It was a glorious, joyful spectacle. Drinking plavac mali and eating seafood on the beach, I blessed Korƒçula‚Äôs intoxicating mix of water and wine.

‚Ä¢ The trip was provided by Prestige Holidays, which has seven nights‚Äô B&B at the Hotel Borik from ¬£455pp, including flights to Dubrovnik and transfers. Scooter hire at Korkyra from ‚Ç¨25 a day. For further information, visit croatia.hr",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
360,Cycling and cava in Catalonia ‚Äì a bike trip with bubbles,[],"Great scenery, ancient lanes and sparkling wine combine on a tour south-west of Barcelona, on which it‚Äôs not only the hill climbs that make this cyclist feel dizzy

Metres ahead, up on the ridge, the air seems to be wobbling in the midday Catalonian sun. It is only when I reach the peak of the incline, light-headed and breathless, that I realise these wobbles are not heatwaves rippling from the road. Rather, clouds of white butterflies are dancing above the vineyards that drop down towards the village of La Granada. They flutter across my face and land on my arms. Behind them, like stone sentinels keeping watch from the horizon, loom the Montserrat mountains. If it wasn‚Äôt for the sunburn and my padded lyrca shorts, I would feel like a princess in a Disney film.

Enchanting moments such as this pepper my cycling expedition through Alt Pened√®s, a rolling region less than an hour‚Äôs train ride south-west of Barcelona.

My husband and I are sampling part of a new six-day cycling itinerary, pedalling between boutique guesthouses via an ancient web of lanes criss-crossing one of Europe‚Äôs oldest viticultural heartlands. Frequent stops at the wineries that produce the local cava are obligatory, obviously. The route starts in Sant Jaume dels Domenys, and winds its way through rolling vineyards to Cal Ruget in Rovira Roja and on to the sleepy village of Sant Lloren√ß d‚ÄôHortons ‚Äì with stays in three rural hotels (our luggage is transferred by car).

Facebook Twitter Pinterest The route covers on average about 30km each day.

Spectacular abandoned farmhouses line the roads, a reminder of how strongly history resonates in the region. Generalissimo Franco sought to crush Catalonia‚Äôs sense of identity but now the region‚Äôs bright red and yellow flag flutters from many homes, and independence is again freely debated in places such as the gothic quarter of Vilafranca Del Pened√®s, the capital of Alt Pened√®s.

Navigation is old-school: the daily 30km route is detailed on a paper map and printed directions (with details of wineries to look out for and suggested stops). At times the journey can be a fraught affair, with getting lost among the endless vineyards an ever-present risk. Long lunches (not included in the price) become part of our daily routine, a welcome respite from the heat. One culinary highlight is rice with squid ink which we wash down with some Raventos i Blanc de Nit Rose 2014 at Cal Ticus in the region‚Äôs cava capital, Sant Sadurn√≠ d‚ÄôAnoia.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Cava at Hotel De Giminelles.

Many here are convinced cava‚Äôs time has come. Although its reputation has been somewhat muddied by cheapish, sugary bottles that might be found next to Lambrini in the supermarket, the success of prosecco as a non-luxury sparkling wine has articulated the market potential for what is ostensibly champagne at a brilliant price. Both champagne and cava are produced using the same m√©thode champenoise. Here, however, is a chance to sample a range of sophisticated tastes and flavours, with plenty of organic and biodynamic varieties. Beneath Alt Pened√®s lies an enormous network of deep subterranean halls crammed with fermenting bottles of the stuff.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gothic quarter of Vilafranca Del Penedes.

Sampling another gran reserva brut natura in the gardens of the Par√©s B√†lta family-owned winery confirms that my rapidly acquired taste for bubbles could be permanent. Torres, one of the bigger wineries, even offers the chance to taste while perusing its museum.

The local cuisine dovetails perfectly for the requirements of a day‚Äôs cycling. Breakfast is an onslaught of bread flavoured with fresh tomatoes, garlic and olive oil, plus cheeses and cake. It‚Äôs a delicious carb load that powers us through several hill climbs. Days end with feasts at each guesthouse (often with a trademark fusion of land and sea such as chicken and langoustine).

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Harriet cycling towards mountains of Montserrat.

However exhausting moments of cycling uphill are, there are few better feelings than the righteous glow after a day‚Äôs exercise. One such moment comes late one afternoon on the terrace of Hotel de Gimenelles in Sant Jaume. Before me stands a chilled bottle of Jan√© Ventura Reserva de la M√∫sica Cava 2012. Below are vineyards where the grape I am now tasting grew. Across the fields comes the sound of laughter from a farmhouse where friends are enjoying a lunch. Behind it lies the Mediterranean, a sliver of blue on the horizon. And to the right, hills which tomorrow we intend to conquer.

361,From Venice into the mountains: fizzing around on the prosecco trail,[],"Few cities are more intimately acquainted with a drink than Venice is with prosecco. Produced mainly in the Veneto region, of which Venice is the capital, it is sipped in every back-street bacaro and plush hotel bar across town, whatever the hour. It provides the fizz in a bellini and tops up many a spritz as long Venetian afternoons give way to evening. Some places even have it on tap.

As I‚Äôve come to the Veneto to learn more about this surgingly popular sparkling wine (Britons bought 85m bottles of prosecco last year; the UK market is expected to grow by more than 10% between now and 2020) it feels appropriate that Venice is my first stop. Indeed, it would be rude not to spend an afternoon dipping in and out of tiny wine bars around the city, getting a sense of how prosecco ought to be drunk, before heading inland to find out how it is made.

We begin at Cantina Do Mori, around the corner from the Rialto food market. This low-lit room, with copper pots hanging from the ceiling and a long counter laden with cicchetti (bar snacks), is said to be the oldest bacaro in Venice. One of my companions, Luca Dusi, who co-owns the east London wine distributor Passione Vino, orders a bottle of the house fizz while Maurilio Molteni, head chef at Tozi in Victoria, London ‚Äì who is scouting for new sparkling wines to stock at his restaurant ‚Äì negotiates the cicchetti.

Bottoms up ‚Ä¶ Cantina Do Mori, near the Rialto market in Venice. Photograph: Alamy

The prosecco, which we drink out of coupe glasses, is a crisp, refined version of the often sickly sweet drink I know from back home. ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù says Luca, noting the flavour of Williams pear common to most types of prosecco. He takes another sip and raises a conspiratorial eyebrow. ‚ÄúBut I think we can find better.‚Äù

Our next stop, in the university area of Dorsoduro, is a lovely little canal-side bar called Adriatico Mar, which specialises in food and wine from Italy‚Äôs coastal regions. The owner, Francesco Molinari, lays out a selection for us, beginning with a sublime baccal√† (salt cod) crostini with pink peppercorns, which gets an approving nod from Maurilio. Although there‚Äôs no fizz here, I do try an interesting still wine made from glera, the prosecco grape. It has the grapefruit notes that you find in some proseccos but no sparkle and very little of the sweetness.

Luca is keen to show me yet another side of prosecco, one that has become increasingly popular in recent years, and so we slip out of Venice and drive north-east to Ponte di Piave. In this unassuming town on the Veneto flatlands, Carolina Gatti has been putting her stamp on the family winery since she took over in 2012. We visit her home amid the vineyards for dinner ‚Äì pork ribs in red wine ‚Äì and try her version of prosecco, which she produces col fondo, or unfiltered. The result is cloudy, due to the sediment in the bottle, and full-bodied, its robust apple and baked-bread flavours a world away from the delicate drink we had earlier at Do Mori.

Col fondo is not just a new trend: it‚Äôs how Carolina‚Äôs family has been making prosecco for generations. It is only in the past decade, since it started becoming fashionable outside the region, that she has started bottling it for public consumption. Carolina‚Äôs wines are magnificent ‚Äì gutsy and complex ‚Äì but by this stage I‚Äôm craving a bit of scenery. The next morning, we head north into the mountainous heart of prosecco country.

Grape expectations ‚Ä¶ harvest time in Valdobbiadene. Photograph: Sergio Pitamitz/Getty Images

The area between the towns of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene is one of two regions where prosecco with the designation of origin DOCG is produced. It‚Äôs not necessarily better than DOC prosecco from the wider Veneto, explains Luca, but it tells you that the bubbles in your glass come from the heartlands, where prosecco has been made since the mid-19th century.

Encircling the region is the Strada del Prosecco, a 90km wine route that winds through villages and past ancient churches, castles and hermitages, as well as endless rows of neatly planted vines. We join it at Conegliano and head west, passing the Scuola Enologica, Italy‚Äôs oldest wine school, on our way out of town. The landscape gets progressively hillier towards Valdobbiadene and at a certain point the mist clears, revealing the snowy Dolomites in the far distance.

On a hilltop above Col San Martino, we pause to take in the dramatic view. Gazing out across the undulating landscape, it seems that every available inch of land, however steep, is planted with vines ‚Äì it‚Äôs no surprise that the DOCG area yields 90m bottles of prosecco a year.

We descend to the town of Sernaglia della Battaglia, and stop by a little osteria on Via Roma. There‚Äôs no sign outside ‚Äì it‚Äôs known locally as Silmava‚Äôs ‚Äì and the interior is plain, with an old marble counter, red and yellow tiles on the floor and framed poems on the wall. The owner, Silmava Pillonetto, inherited the bar from her parents, who opened it 70 years ago. Cloudy prosecco is her thing, though Silmava notes that drinking habits have changed over the years and early-morning customers these days want coffee instead of wine. We have a couple of glasses of chilled col fondo to correct the balance, and head on, utterly charmed.

The final stop of our trip is Malibr√†n, a winery outside the town of Susegana, with its looming 13th-century castle of San Salvatore. Though his farm is several times larger than Carolina‚Äôs, Maurizio Favrel still harvests his grapes by hand. He walks us through the cellar, explaining how his col fondo is fermented in the bottle after an initial stage in a steel tank, whereas his filtered prosecco is tank-fermented all the way through.

After the tour, we retire to the estate kitchen, where Maurilio unpacks the vegetables and seafood we bought from the Rialto market the day before and gets cooking. As well as feeding us handsomely ‚Äì with castraure artichokes, gratinated langoustine and a brodetto of sea bass and monkfish ‚Äì Maurilio helps deliver the last and most important lesson of the trip. Prosecco shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as merely an aperitif. If it‚Äôs good enough and has a bit of col fondo character, as Malibr√†n‚Äôs cloudy Sottoriva does, you can drink it with all kinds of food.

You don‚Äôt have to be in a Venetian bacaro, or amid rolling vineyards in the Veneto, to appreciate this lesson, but it certainly isn‚Äôt a drawback if you are.

Fort William beckons today, as you enjoy your holiday‚Äôs final highlight ‚Äì the journey on the last stretch of the famous West Highland Line, to the tiny fishing village of Mallaig. Voted by readers of Wanderlust Magazine as the world‚Äôs best train journey, this is another truly spectacular route. As the train pulls out of Fort William, look back and left to see Ben Nevis towering above the town. Minutes later, the train crosses the Caledonian Canal ‚Äì look out for Neptune's Staircase, a succession of eight locks, to your right. The train then runs alongside Loch Eil before reaching the spectacular, 21-arch, Glenfinnan Viaduct - famously featured in the Harry Potter movies. Other highlights of the journey include island-studded Loch Eilt (considered by many to be the prettiest along the route), Arisaig (Britain‚Äôs most westerly railway station) and the white Atlantic sands of Morar. Mallaig is a delightful, thriving place, with a working port, and is well worth exploring.

After breakfast we discover Honfleur, often regarded as the most picturesque spot on the northern French coast. Exquisitely preserved, its old harbour ‚Äì complete with both fishing boats and luxurious pleasure craft ‚Äì is surrounded by a pretty waterfront of tall pastel-coloured houses dating from the 16th to 18th centuries. Many of these have been converted into seafood restaurants or traditional shops selling all sorts of items. Take a seat at one of these quayside restaurants and observe talented artists capturing the superb views on canvas, perhaps inspired to follow in the footsteps of Eug√®ne Boudin, a native of Honfleur and one of the forerunners of Impressionism. Away from the harbour, Honfleur‚Äôs intricate maze of streets is a delight to wander through and offers an authentic flavour of this wonderfully provincial old port. This afternoon is devoted to Normandy‚Äôs most iconic food produce ‚Äì cheese and cider. The gentle rolling hills and temperate climate of Normandy are ideal for apple cultivation and cattle rearing. In many places, the two types of agriculture have become almost symbiotic, with the grazing cows in apple orchards fertilising the soil in a virtuous cycle. We stop to visit an organic cider producer to learn about the cider-making process, as well as the various other apple-based drinks, such as pommeau and calvados.

For many, today‚Äôs visit to Vienna will be one of the highlights of the cruise. The city‚Äôs very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city‚Äôs most iconic monument is the breathtaking Saint Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral, whose striking multicoloured roof and huge Gothic South Tower dominate the skyline. There‚Äôs also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School, and where the Vienna Boys‚Äô Choir performs. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire, including, allegedly, the sabre of Charlemagne himself. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, which contains the world‚Äôs fourth largest collection of paintings, is just across the road. This morning we have a tour with a local guide offering insights into why Vienna is one of Europe‚Äôs great capitals ‚Äì the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world‚Äôs finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and, of course, a whole family of Strausses. During the afternoon you‚Äôre free to explore as you wish. Take a stroll in the Prater, notable for the huge Ferris wheel that features in several Cold War spy thrillers. Or, for something quite different, visit the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, a former royal residence now housing a range of world-class museums and galleries. Perhaps, though, just take a stroll through Vienna‚Äôs atmospheric side streets, enjoy a coffee and a slice of delicious Sachertorte in one of the extraordinarily ornate coffee houses, or admire the skill of the street entertainers and even the occasional opera singer. This evening we‚Äôve arranged truly the ‚Äòicing on the cake‚Äô: no visit to Vienna is complete without a live musical experience, so after dinner we have a classical recital on board.

There‚Äôs nothing quite like that feeling of anticipation when gliding alongside the promenade of a river port, snatching tantalising glimpses of what lies ashore, and Koblenz ‚Äì beautifully located at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle Rivers ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt disappoint.

There‚Äôs a perfect opportunity to avail yourself of some of the ship‚Äôs range of five-star facilities this morning ‚Äì maybe a little gentle exercise in the fitness room before heading up to the sun deck to enjoy a coffee whilst chatting with newly-made friends as our ship makes a graceful arrival in Porto once more, passing under the city‚Äôs spectacular bridges. Porto is of course synonymous with wonderful port wine and all the famous port producers are here, such as C√°lem, Sandeman and Ferreira, so a visit here would not be complete without a tour of one of them. You‚Äôll learn about this fortified wine‚Äôs fascinating history and its close British connections. Port is made from grapes still pressed in the traditional way ‚Äì by feet ‚Äì then lovingly matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you‚Äôll get the chance to sample various port styles at the end of our visit. After lunch on board we enjoy a guided tour of Porto. Strategically overlooking the Douro as it empties into the Atlantic, Portugal‚Äôs second largest city was originally a Roman town, but its wealth derived from its knowledge of the sea routes to India, with fortunes made from trading spices, silks and other fine goods. Our tour unveils some of its major and more surprising sights. You‚Äôll have the rest of the afternoon to explore the truly fascinating city; so perhaps return to the terraced streets of the old town and wander the sloping maze of winding, cobbled alleyways, soaking up the atmosphere whilst stopping to admire the lovely architecture, soaring bell towers, fine baroque churches, golden rooftops and beautiful tiles of this slice of traditional Portugal. Stop for a drink in a cosy caf√© and be tempted by an array of delicious cakes and pastries ‚Äì perhaps sample a pastel de nata, the traditional Portuguese custard tart. This evening, enjoy a final dinner on board expertly served by our restaurant staff under the supervision of the ma√Ætre d‚Äô. Afterwards, perhaps settle into the lounge to chat into the evening and reflect on the splendours of the remarkable River Douro ‚Äì over a glass of port, of course.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

After our first splendid breakfast, we‚Äôve a leisurely start enjoying a guided tour of Lyon, one of France‚Äôs most fascinating cities. The Rh√¥ne Valley had been the route of choice for marauding armies and peaceful traders for centuries, and Lyon‚Äôs current site, at the confluence of the Rh√¥ne and Sa√¥ne Rivers, cried out to be fortified. In 43 BC the Romans founded the city, which subsequently grew in importance; the Emperor Claudius, conqueror of Britain, was born here. There are many Roman remains to see, but it was the production of silk that brought Lyon to prominence during the Middle Ages, and throughout the city you can see signs of the wealth that poured in ‚Äì Renaissance buildings, imposing churches and Europe‚Äôs largest pedestrian square, Place Bellecour, with a statue of Louis XIV as its focus. The Old Town, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is crammed with antique shops and intriguing traboules ‚Äì narrow covered passageways enabling silk merchants to transport their wares to the river without getting wet ‚Äì that today are a joy to amble through. As well as its glorious architecture, Lyon is generally acknowledged as France‚Äôs (and to locals the world‚Äôs) gastronomic capital. In fairness it has much to commend it: nouvelle cuisine was invented near here and the city boasts a huge array of speciality food shops and eateries, including 20 restaurants with one or more Michelin stars and countless little places to eat.

Another day dawns and you rise refreshed as we continue our southerly course, firstly calling at Tela≈°ƒáica, one of the largest and most beautiful natural harbours in the Adriatic - largely uninhabited, this is a stunningly rugged stretch of coastline backed by sheer limestone cliffs that plummet into the sea, flanked by a scattering of pretty islets and islands, home to numerous plant and bird species such as rare peregrine falcons. During our stop here, you‚Äôll have opportunity to wander to the shores of Lake Mir, a natural salt lake, with its warm, supposedly therapeutic water that channels through the limestone on its way out to sea. Later this morning, have your camera at the ready as we are soon entering the waters of the breathtaking Kornati archipelago; an explosion of numerous fascinating desert-like islands lie scattered around the central island of Kornat. George Bernard Shaw wrote that [God] ‚Äòcreated the Kornati Islands out of tears, stars and breath' and there is certainly something ethereal about their distinctive barren beauty. In fact, this remarkable region was designated a National Park in 1980, in celebration of its extraordinarily unusual and desolate charm. The Kornati Islands hide a multitude of secret caves and grottoes amongst the rugged cliffs. Our Captain will drop anchor to allow a swim stop this morning, so enjoy a cooling dip before lunch again on board. Later we arrive at the little port of ≈†ibenik, where our guided tour reveals more about the history of this delightful town as we wander its medieval streets, seeing the beautifully restored Renaissance town hall and remarkable Gothic cathedral, thought to be the world‚Äôs largest church built without brick or wood supports. This evening the MS Il Mare remains moored in ≈†ibenik. Dinner is at leisure tonight so wander ashore and seek out some traditional Croatian fare: hearty fish stew or mouth-wateringly tender slow cooked beef, simmered with wine and prunes, with fresh crusty bread baked ‚Äòunder the lid‚Äô ‚Äì a typical Croatian style of cooking.

This morning we set sail back towards Luxor. After lunch, we visit the temples of Karnak and Luxor on the eastern bank of the Nile. The astounding Hypostyle Hall is the most awe-inspiring part of this vast complex, said to be the largest religious centre of the ancient world. Its 134 gigantic columns stretch up to 80ft high and are covered in hieroglyphics ‚Äì look carefully and you‚Äôll spot traces of the original colours still visible. One of the many interesting features is the first documented peace treaty in history, between Ramses II and the Hittites. Another highlight is the great Obelisk of Hatshepsut, carved from one 97-foot high block of polished red granite and weighing in at over 300 tons, it has stood here for over 3,450 years, a testament to the amazing abilities and ingenuity of its creators.

Along with the Taj Mahal and the Pyramids, Petra is one of the world‚Äôs ‚Äòmust-see‚Äô sights, firmly deserving of its accolade as one of the new Seven Wonders of the World. Famous throughout history, its huge wealth was amassed from its time as the centre of the ancient caravan routes, which traded as far as China and rivalled that of the Romans. A city to match was created, with sophisticated public buildings and libraries, lavish houses, colonnaded streets, and astonishing villas carved from solid rock. We walk down the increasingly narrow gorge and, just as you think the vertiginous sides could not get any narrower, the incredible vista of the Treasury appears like a mirage through a slit in the rock. The perfection of its proportions and the sheer vastness of this edifice are astounding. Beyond, there‚Äôs an entire city waiting to be discovered: the amazing Royal Tombs, the theatre, the Street of the Facades, the Great Temple, early-Christian churches, and the main colonnaded road that ran through the centre of this ancient but tremendously cultured city.

383,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from Ant√≥nio Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: ‚ÄúHumanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back ‚Äì and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes ‚Ä¶ Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.‚Äù

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) ‚Äì which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible ‚Äì and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

‚ÄúMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,‚Äù he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. ‚ÄúIt must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. ‚ÄúThis is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test ‚Ä¶ We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.‚Äù

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable ‚Äì even in rich countries ‚Äì were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Ni√±a weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: ‚ÄúI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year ‚Äì the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.‚Äù

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to ‚Äúflick the green switch‚Äù while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days‚Äô time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: ‚ÄúWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.‚Äù

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. ‚ÄúNext year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,‚Äù he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. ‚ÄúThere is no vaccine against climate warming,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúBut there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.‚Äù

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

‚ÄúMoney, money, money,‚Äù said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. ‚ÄúThe question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.‚Äù

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK‚Äôs spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host‚Äôs leverage in bringing developing countries together.

‚ÄúA country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
384,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"Heavily redacted court filing, which does not name Trump, comes as president reportedly is considering sweeping pardons

An alleged ‚Äúbribery for pardon‚Äù scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered ‚Äúa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence‚Äù.

Giuliani and Trump reported to have discussed 'pre-emptive pardon' Read more

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the ‚Äúbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äù, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the ‚Äúsubject or target‚Äù of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. ‚ÄúPardon investigation is Fake News!‚Äù he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‚Äòbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äô is.‚Äù

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro tweeted: ‚ÄúIn 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day ‚Äì but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a ‚Äúpre-emptive pardon‚Äù. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives‚Äô intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt presume ‚Äì and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

‚ÄúIt may be someone that we‚Äôve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.‚Äù

386,'I saw people dying on the road': Tigray's traumatised war refugees,[],"When Ethiopia‚Äôs army shelled Humera, a small agricultural city in Tigray, in mid-November, 54-year-old Gush Tela rushed his wife and three children to safety in a nearby town.

A few days later, he felt compelled to find out what had become of his home. As he approached the city on his motorbike, riding through the arid countryside, he said the stench of countless dead bodies filled the air.

Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said.

‚ÄúI saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,‚Äù Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.‚Äù

Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia‚Äôs prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region‚Äôs ruling party, the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies.

Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents ‚Äì and who was responsible.

On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia‚Äôs government had signed a deal to allow ‚Äúunimpeded‚Äù humanitarian access to Tigray ‚Äì at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people.

Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. ‚ÄúI was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never felt this situation would ever happen.‚Äù



Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba.

Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces.

At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia‚Äôs governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency.

About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted.

Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies.

Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost two crisis on top of each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.‚Äù

Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility.



Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù Tigrayans.

The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes.



Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia.

For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. ‚ÄúIt was very successful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.‚Äù

Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. ‚ÄúBut those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,‚Äù he said.

With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet.

He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we‚Äôre serving 200 patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of drugs every time, so we‚Äôre using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.‚Äù

Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. ‚ÄúRespiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.‚Äù

Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. ‚ÄúWe were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,‚Äù he said.

Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren‚Äôt accessing treatment.

Women‚Äôs reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap.

Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray‚Äôs leadership.

Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias. She accused Abiy of exploiting ethnic divisions and fuelling resentment. ‚ÄúIt is purely ethnic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe country was fair but Abiy wanted all the power. The government made it seem that the problems with Ethiopia were because of Tigray.‚Äù

The rest of her family remains in Tigray. ‚ÄúMy life is there, my family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just waiting to see if things improve.‚Äù

387,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc‚Äôs chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as ‚Äúderisory‚Äù by Downing Street.

On the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

‚ÄúBarnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rush?‚Äô‚Äù said one senior EU diplomat. ‚ÄúAmbassadors for every country bordering the UK ‚Äì 11 all in all ‚Äì raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.‚Äù

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. ‚ÄúThe EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,‚Äù a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in ‚Äúembryo‚Äù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

An EU diplomat said: ‚ÄúWe are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

‚ÄúAs we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.‚Äù

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe‚Äôs coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

A source said: ‚ÄúFish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.‚Äù

David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament‚Äôs Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year.

He tweeted: ‚ÄúWe are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

388,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain‚Äôs hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,‚Äù he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI want to make sure we‚Äôre going to fight like hell by investing in America first.‚Äù He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America‚Äôs domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden‚Äôs priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his ‚Äúgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China‚Äôs abusive practices ‚Äì that‚Äôs stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations‚Äù and forcing ‚Äútech transfers‚Äù from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. ‚ÄúThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our ‚Äì or at least what used to be our ‚Äì allies on the same page. It‚Äôs going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.‚Äù

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.‚Äù He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal ‚Äúwith the nuclear programme‚Äù.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. ‚ÄúAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,‚Äù he said.

Then, Biden added: ‚ÄúIn consultation with our allies and partners, we‚Äôre going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran‚Äôs nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.‚Äù He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal ‚Äì France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China ‚Äì to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
389,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja‚Äôi Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband‚Äôs aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: ‚ÄúThe procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.‚Äù

The UN said he had been ‚Äúreportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process‚Äù and then ‚Äúforced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras‚Äù.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilm√®s, Belgium‚Äôs deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to ‚Äúdiscuss consular issues‚Äù on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

Wilm√®s also condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last Friday. Iran claimed on Thursday to have identified the individuals responsible for bringing weapons into the country, but gave no details.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
390,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation‚Äôs special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada‚Äôs so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada‚Äôs elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

The Canadian soldiers took horrific ‚Äútrophy‚Äù photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada‚Äôs own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada‚Äôs defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette ‚Äì who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take ‚Äì said that in Canada‚Äôs case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking at the experience that we had, where there were ‚Ä¶ war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn‚Äôt think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it‚Äôs actually worked out.‚Äù

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

‚ÄúIn a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn‚Äôt seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,‚Äù Collenette said.

He said Canada‚Äôs approach ‚Äì disbandment coupled with major organisational reform ‚Äì has been ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù.

No Canadian government ‚Äì conservative or liberal ‚Äì has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

‚ÄúIt was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we‚Äôd fought in world wars, and we‚Äôd never had anything like this.‚Äù

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

‚ÄúEven when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,‚Äù Collenette said. ‚ÄúWe did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it‚Äôs 25 years after the fact.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
391,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has condemned the behaviour of MEP J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Sz√°jer‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúWhat our representative, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,‚Äù said Orb√°n on Wednesday evening. He said Sz√°jer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orb√°n‚Äôs government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Sz√°jer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary‚Äôs constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

Right-wing Hungarian MEP resigns for attending 'sex party' that broke Belgian lockdown Read more

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium‚Äôs coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Sz√°jer‚Äôs resignation. ‚ÄúHe made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,‚Äù it read.

Prior to Orb√°n‚Äôs intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

‚ÄúMr Sz√°jer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,‚Äù said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Sz√°jer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region‚Äôs deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him ‚Äúfleeing along the gutter‚Äù to escape the raid.

Sz√°jer admitted he had been at a ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Sz√°jer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Sz√°jer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. ‚ÄúI always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something ‚Äì just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,‚Äù he said. He added that guests had been ‚Äúcompletely naked‚Äù at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Sz√°jer for possession of drugs. But the ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Sz√°jer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Sz√°jer boasted that he had drafted Hungary‚Äôs new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as ‚Äúa 21st-century constitution‚Äù when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Sz√°jer said: ‚ÄúIt depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don‚Äôt think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.‚Äù

In the intervening decade, Orb√°n‚Äôs government has gone further in its ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orb√°n‚Äôs government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, ‚Äúthe mother is a woman and the father is a man‚Äù. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government‚Äôs justification for the amendment explained that ‚Äúnew, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development‚Äù.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Sz√°jer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making ‚Äúa huge political deal out of a sex scandal‚Äù and praised Sz√°jer‚Äôs statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary‚Äôs government.

392,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 13 and a half months over protest,[],"The high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong will spend more than a year in jail over an unauthorised protest outside police headquarters in June last year, a court in the city has ruled.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong‚Äôs recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

‚ÄúThe court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court‚Äôs view, made the case more serious,‚Äù the judge said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: ‚ÄúEveryone hang in there, add oil,‚Äù using a phrase of encouragement meaning ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: ‚ÄúI will hang in there.‚Äù

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù in his stomach, according to a post on the activist‚Äôs social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday‚Äôs sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted ‚Äúanother blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong‚Äù.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. ‚ÄúI urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,‚Äù he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong‚Äôs arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù and described it as ‚Äúanother example of HK authorities targeting activists‚Äù.

393,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim‚Äôs daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother‚Äôs death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: ‚ÄúDirect fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.‚Äù

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had ‚Äúfractures of the entire right hemifacial bone‚Äù. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim‚Äôs chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane‚Äôs apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded ‚Äúthe weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police‚Äù. It added: ‚ÄúThere is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired‚Äù, and concluded the grenade had ‚Äúhit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection‚Äù.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that ‚Äúthere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas‚Äù. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

‚ÄúThere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,‚Äù the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: ‚ÄúIt was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.‚Äù

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. ‚ÄúShe was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,‚Äù Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

‚ÄúThe police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.‚Äù

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

‚ÄúThis is a political issue. It‚Äôs important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

‚ÄúMr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.‚Äù

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by ‚Äúscientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts‚Äù who had examined the ‚Äúangle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,‚Äù he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
394,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November‚Äôs presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

‚ÄúNot a day goes by where there‚Äôs not a crowd outside,‚Äù Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump‚Äôs election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù was Giuliani‚Äôs response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani‚Äôs 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business‚Äôs branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

‚ÄúThis is a construction yard, that‚Äôs a liability,‚Äù Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

‚ÄúIt did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‚ÄòWho knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?‚Äô‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians‚Äô incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

‚ÄúI gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

Six in a row: winning numbers in South African lottery are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10

An unusual sequence of numbers drawn by South Africa‚Äôs national lottery has left players dumbfounded and sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a ‚ÄúPowerBall‚Äù number of 10 were the South African national lottery‚Äôs winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (¬£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

‚ÄúCongratulations to tonight‚Äôs 20 winners of PowerBall draw,‚Äù the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThese numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.‚Äù

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

‚ÄúLotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,‚Äù posted one Twitter user. ‚Äú20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,‚Äù ventured another. ‚ÄúAbsolutely no way in hell that‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma‚Äôs nine-year tenure.

South Africa‚Äôs National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review ‚Äúand if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo we are in the process of doing that currently.‚Äù

396,Trump lawyer: ex-election security chief Krebs should be 'taken out and shot',[],"A former head of US election security who said Donald Trump‚Äôs defeat by Joe Biden was not subject to voter fraud should be ‚Äútaken out at dawn and shot‚Äù, a Trump campaign lawyer said.

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a ‚Äúmob attorney‚Äù.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump‚Äôs claims, ‚Äúwas the most secure in American history‚Äù.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit ‚Äì and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

‚ÄúAnybody who thinks the election went well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.‚Äù

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to ‚Äúundermine democracy ‚Ä¶ to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people‚Äù.

Trump called that interview ‚Äúridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke‚Äù.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president‚Äôs disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump‚Äôs legal team was ‚Äútalking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I‚Äôve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre going to have to be dealt with politically. It‚Äôs the only way you deal with these people.‚Äù

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden‚Äôs win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThreats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It‚Äôs behavior befitting a mob attorney.‚Äù

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made ‚Äúa retaliatory threat involving Krebs‚Äô official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351‚Äù.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and DiGenova should ‚Äúface disbarment at least‚Äù.

The footage showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks. Coughing could be heard.

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors ‚Äì violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president‚Äôs aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady‚Äôs spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, ‚Äúwhile providing the safest environment possible.‚Äù She said that would include smaller guest lists, that ‚Äúmasks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending the parties will be a very personal choice,‚Äù she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

‚ÄúIf the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,‚Äù Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms‚Äô content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a ‚Äúmust-pass‚Äù because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won‚Äôt agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

Joe Biden, the US president-elect, formally introduced his top economic advisers on Tuesday, as his incoming administration prepares to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Bipartisan group pitches $908bn Covid-19 relief to break deadlock in Congress Read more

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to create a recovery for everybody,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúOur message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he ‚Äúmight have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical‚Äù about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúLost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American tragedy and it‚Äôs essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world‚Äôs population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths ‚Äì more than 268,000 ‚Äì with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: ‚ÄúThe team I‚Äôm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.‚Äù

His ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: ‚ÄúReward hard work in America, not wealth. It‚Äôs time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It‚Äôs time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.‚Äù

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Neera a long time,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.‚Äù

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

For Biden, Tuesday‚Äôs sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump‚Äôs false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden‚Äôs victory, meaning Trump‚Äôs legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

399,Wisconsin and Arizona certify Biden wins in yet another blow to Trump,[],"Joe Biden‚Äôs victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump‚Äôs longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden‚Äôs nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

‚ÄúToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,‚Äù Wisconsin‚Äôs governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.‚Äù

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden‚Äôs lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin‚Äôs Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.‚Äù

Kaul noted that Trump‚Äôs recount targeted only the state‚Äôs two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. ‚ÄúI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn‚Äôt a game of gotcha.‚Äù

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state‚Äôs 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden‚Äôs overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump‚Äôs legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden‚Äôs narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

Arizona‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

‚ÄúWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,‚Äù Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election ‚Äúwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona‚Äôs laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary‚Äù.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump‚Äôs lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the ‚Äúgreatest scam ever perpetrated against our country‚Äù. When he mentioned Ducey‚Äôs name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of ‚Äúrushing to sign‚Äù papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: ‚ÄúArizona won‚Äôt forget what Ducey just did.‚Äù

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.‚Äù

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone‚Äôs ringtone for calls from the White House is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

Trump‚Äôs denials of political reality have left him increasingly isolated as a growing number of Republicans acknowledge the transition and Biden moves ahead with naming appointments to his administration.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

The comments came as L√≥pez Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask, saying it was a question of liberty.

The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people‚Äôs movements are ‚Äúfashionable among authorities ‚Ä¶ who want to show they are heavy-handed, dictatorship.

‚ÄúA lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúthe fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty.‚Äù

L√≥pez Obrador‚Äôs comments came a day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Mexico was ‚Äúin bad shape‚Äù with the pandemic and urged its leaders to take the coronavirus seriously.

‚ÄúThe number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,‚Äù said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In his commments on Wednesday, it was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries, or the mainly opposition-party local leaders in Mexico.

Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes, something L√≥pez Obrador has fiercely resisted doing, arguing some people live day-to-day on what they earn on the streets.

Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement, which resulted in scandals of abusive behavior by police.

L√≥pez Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary.

‚ÄúEveryone is free. Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so,‚Äù L√≥pez Obrador said.

The Mexican government has gone against the grain of international anti-virus practices in two ways. It has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks, and has described mass testing as wasteful and pointless.

Mexico has seen almost 107,000 test-confirmed deaths so far, the fourth-highest toll in the world, but Mexico does relatively little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is closer to 150,000.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
402,"Beware fake coronavirus vaccines, says Interpol",[],"Agency warns police forces to prepare for criminal gangs to try to sell illicit vaccines

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

It said the pandemic had already triggered ‚Äúunprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour‚Äù and warned of a new wave of criminal activity ‚Äúin relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs ‚Äúplan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives‚Äù, the Interpol secretary general, J√ºrgen Stock, said.

‚ÄúIt is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of ‚Äúunauthorised and falsified‚Äù coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

403,France will carry out border checks to stop skiers from spreading Covid,[],"France will carry out random border checks over the holiday season targeting French skiers on their way to and from foreign resorts ‚Äì particularly Switzerland and Spain ‚Äì where slopes stay open, the prime minister, Jean Castex, has said.

‚ÄúThe goal is to avoid French citizens getting contaminated. That will be done by performing random checks at the borders,‚Äù Castex told French television, adding that returning holidaymakers would be ordered to quarantine for seven days.

While Alpine resorts in France will technically be open over Christmas, ski lifts and other essential winter sports infrastructure, as well as bars and restaurants, will not as the country strives to avoid fuelling a third wave of the coronavirus.

Italy and Germany share the French position and have indicated, to the fury of many local businesses, that their pistes will remain in effect closed over the Christmas and new year periods, which can account for up to 20% of some resorts‚Äô income.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, last week joined Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in calling for a Europe-wide shutdown of winter sports until 10 January.

Coronavirus clusters in Alpine resorts such as Austria‚Äôs Ischgl played a key role in the spread of the virus during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, with holidaymakers bringing Covid-19 back home following ski trips abroad.

Austria also said on Wednesday that while skiing could resume on 24 December, lift capacity would be limited, bars, restaurants, and hotels would remain largely closed until January, and people entering the country from abroad would have to quarantine.

The measures in effect mean skiiing will only be possible over the holiday season for locals who live close to the slopes. The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it should be possible ‚Äúfor a large part of our population to go skiing at least for the day‚Äù.

Conte asked Italians not to take to the slopes at all during the Christmas holidays, and called on all other European countries with major winter sports sectors to agree common rules to prevent cases being imported if Italy‚Äôs pistes stayed closed.

‚ÄúIt will not be possible to allow winter sports holidays this year, we cannot afford it,‚Äù the Italian prime minister said, arguing that despite a strict safety protocol devised by operators, ‚Äúeverything revolving around holidays on the snow is uncontrollable‚Äù.

Switzerland and Spain, however, have so far proved reluctant to impose restrictions. The Swiss interior minister, Alain Berset, said last week the country was ‚Äúautonomous. We can decide for ourselves whether we leave ski areas open. But we know what‚Äôs at stake.‚Äù

The Swiss government is expected to formally announce its position on limiting foreign visitors on Friday, while the Spanish government is still consulting with its autonomous regions on what measures to take.

Castex said on Wednesday that Switzerland and Spain were ‚Äúnot thus far falling into line‚Äù, but that ‚Äúdiplomatic action is continuing ‚Äì the die has not been completely cast‚Äù. He said he would continue ‚Äúto protect my fellow citizens by preventing them from going to contaminate themselves‚Äù, adding that the French measures were also ‚Äúabout being fair to French resort managers‚Äù.

One French resort, Ch√¢tel in the Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area, has draped Swiss flags around the village in protest against France‚Äôs stance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem with a French government that shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,‚Äù the mayor, Nicolas Rubin, said.

Macron had indicated on Tuesday that the French government was considering taking ‚Äúrestrictive and dissuasive measures‚Äù to prevent the French from going abroad to ski, especially in Switzerland, over the holiday period.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said this week that the risk of catching Covid-19 while actually skiing was minimal. ‚ÄúI suspect many people won‚Äôt be infected barrelling down the slopes on their skis,‚Äù he said.

But he said the real risks ‚Äúare going to come at airports, tour buses taking people to and from ski resorts, ski lifts ... and places where people come together‚Äù. The WHO was advising all countries to ‚Äúlook at their ski season‚Äù, he said, warning that indoor socialising after skiing might pose a particular threat.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that ‚Äúthe scientists have done it‚Äù, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with ‚Äúover-optimism‚Äù, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.‚Äù

There were still ‚Äúimmense logistical challenges‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúSo it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it‚Äôs all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we‚Äôre not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.‚Äù

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning‚Äôs press conference announcing the vaccine‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAnd what a momentous ‚Ä¶ journey and international effort it has been,‚Äù Van-Tam said. ‚ÄúDiscovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.‚Äù

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. ‚ÄúIf we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‚ÄòOh, the vaccine‚Äôs here, let‚Äôs abandon caution,‚Äô all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.‚Äù

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a ‚Äúcomplex product‚Äù and ‚Äúreally tricky to handle‚Äù, explaining: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.‚Äù

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was ‚Äúgoing to eradicate coronavirus ever‚Äù, but we may get to the point where it becomes ‚Äúa seasonal problem‚Äù like flu. He added: ‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us,‚Äô like the end of the war? No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

405,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to ‚Äúsure and certain knowledge that we will succeed‚Äù after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel ‚Äúquite emotional‚Äù.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected ‚Äì including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions ‚Äì it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

‚ÄúBecause of Brexit, we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,‚Äù Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK ‚Äì and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law ‚Äì but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,‚Äù he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid ‚Äúoveroptimism‚Äù and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England‚Äôs lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

‚ÄúIt will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,‚Äù he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it‚Äôs going to be with humankind forever,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us!‚Äô like the end of the war?

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt. I think those kind of habits, that we‚Äôve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ‚Ä¶ on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called ‚Äúa real cause for concern‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,‚Äù he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said ‚Äúeveryone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut‚Äù in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.‚Äù

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

‚ÄúThis authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
406,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own ‚Äúrobust‚Äù approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, contrasting the UK approach with the ‚Äúpace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly‚Äù.

The EMA said the bloc‚Äôs member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the ‚Äúappropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens‚Äô access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns‚Äù.

Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. ‚ÄúWe have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.‚Äù

The EMA‚Äôs statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included ‚Äúessential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign‚Äù.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation ‚Äúare not expected to affect significantly vaccines‚Äô availability‚Äù. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. ‚ÄúIn years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity‚Äôs charge against this disease,‚Äù he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: ‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don‚Äôt think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.‚Äù

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: ‚ÄúWe may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.‚Äù

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: ‚ÄúIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.‚Äù

Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans

Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a ‚Äúsuper-spreader event‚Äù.

The gathering, called ‚ÄúNaughty in N‚Äôawlins‚Äù saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event‚Äôs organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

‚ÄúIf I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,‚Äù Hannaford wrote.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.‚Äù

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N‚Äôawlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

‚ÄúWhen we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,‚Äù Hannaford said.

‚ÄúIn almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‚ÄòFuck it, it‚Äôs our last day‚Äô and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.‚Äù

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

‚ÄúWe did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‚ÄòNo Dancing‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn‚Äôt really outlaw dancing.

‚ÄúBut seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

‚ÄúPeople bounced and moved by their tables, and even though people were more spread out, I saw a lot more eye contact and positive acknowledgment of short flirts and teases.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
408,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan‚Äôs Princess Mako ‚Äì the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne ‚Äì and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom‚Äôs mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan‚Äôs royals; it has also brought the country‚Äôs succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro‚Äôs mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako‚Äôs father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

‚ÄúI approve of them getting married,‚Äù he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. ‚ÄúThe constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.‚Äù

But, he added, Komuro‚Äôs family needed to make a ‚Äúvisible‚Äù response to his mother‚Äôs financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I don‚Äôt think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]‚Äù ‚Äì adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor‚Äôs daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan‚Äôs succession laws, no female member of the imperial family ‚Äì not even the emperor‚Äôs 19-year-old daughter, Aiko ‚Äì can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako‚Äôs younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other ‚Äúirreplaceable‚Äù, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as ‚Äúsomeone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
409,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it‚Äôs been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK‚Äôs first female prime minister?

It‚Äôs a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council‚Äôs controversial decision to underwrite a ¬£100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: ‚ÄúWe find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúShe was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country‚Äôs has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.‚Äù

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long hard road. There‚Äôs been a few knocks and bumps along the way,‚Äù Schonhut said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see things finally coming to fruition.‚Äù

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit like a mini Brexit,‚Äù she said. She hopes it‚Äôll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . ‚ÄúIn the area we‚Äôre living in we‚Äôre seeing a huge number of homeless people, we‚Äôre seeing food banks springing up all over the place.‚Äù

Burgess added that given Thatcher‚Äôs controversial legacy it was a ‚Äúpoorly judged decision‚Äù to push ahead with the statue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.‚Äù

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

‚ÄúI appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it‚Äôs a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.‚Äù

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. ‚ÄúThe first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
410,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, ‚Äúa lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?‚Äù Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry ‚Äì but rarely their male counterparts ‚Äì have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt find a mother as appealing‚Äù. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had ‚Äúunderestimated this whole mommy thing‚Äù.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry‚Äôs disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children‚Äôs perspective on her last album (‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre going but you don‚Äôt say how long for / You say it‚Äôs work, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US ‚Äúnearly tore me apart‚Äù, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds ‚Äì leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms ‚Äì moving from the ‚Äúfemale pop star‚Äù category to the even more restrictive ‚Äúmum‚Äù box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

‚ÄúI hardly ever get asked about being a father,‚Äù says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter‚Äôs future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly‚Äôs Tom Fletcher ‚Äì whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I‚Äôm a Celebrity ‚Ä¶ contestant Giovanna Fletcher ‚Äì says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another human being.‚Äô So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.‚Äù Hot Chip‚Äôs Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children ‚Äúget upset when I am about to go away‚Äù, they ‚Äúunderstand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not only their own family‚Äôs financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for ‚Äì their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to let anyone down by saying, ‚Äòit would be great to do that festival, but we can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt,‚Äô‚Äù he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. ‚ÄúI think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it‚Äôs our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.‚Äù

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician‚Äôs living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by ‚Äúspeeding back during the night‚Äù after shows, and then ‚Äúdoing the school run in the morning‚Äù. Do his peers see that as normal? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúThey think that‚Äôs mad!‚Äù Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives‚Äô respective due dates, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a band, people expect to see you on stage,‚Äù says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,‚Äù he later said. Fletcher ‚Äì who had his first child ‚Äútwo weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career‚Äù ‚Äì was equally untroubled by the experience. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.‚Äù

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. ‚ÄúAbout 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live ‚Äì we drove our family car with him,‚Äù he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife‚Äôs mother) travelled ‚Äúall around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe‚Äù, an undertaking he describes as ‚Äúpretty easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot too hectic‚Äù.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth‚Äôs huge success during the decade: ‚ÄúWe made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.‚Äù Any earlier ‚Äúwould have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. ‚ÄúEveryone was there to give us everything we needed.‚Äù

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. ‚ÄúThe only person who would ever do that is a band‚Äôs manager and they might say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs going to impact on our finances‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù says Goddard. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.‚Äù The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. ‚ÄúHot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,‚Äù Goddard says. ‚ÄúThe band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.‚Äù Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules ‚Äúpretty challenging‚Äù, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out‚Äù.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of ‚Äúmum guilt‚Äù ‚Äì the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children ‚Äì men have the much milder husband guilt. ‚ÄúMy worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,‚Äù says Spearman, with Goddard adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have ‚Äì my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn‚Äôt have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.‚Äù

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,‚Äù says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn‚Äôt mind him taking paternity leave, ‚Äúif a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that‚Äôs different.‚Äù Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop ‚Äì ‚Äúthere are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older‚Äù ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúthe hormones, what happens to your body‚Äù that men don‚Äôt experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don‚Äôt have any children: ‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt really get those questions: ‚ÄòAre you going to settle down and have a child?‚Äô Women must be asked about it all the time.‚Äù When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. ‚ÄúI would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‚ÄòI probably will have some kids.‚Äô‚Äù

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon‚Äôs work ‚Äúwas going to be interrupted‚Äù. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be focused, but it‚Äôs also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It‚Äôs not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.‚Äù Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact ‚Äì albeit only temporarily. ‚ÄúHaving a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything ‚Äì what my daughter would think in years to come.‚Äù

Little monsters of rock ‚Ä¶ Ozzy Osbourne with son Jack, 1985. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.‚Äù Ghetts says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood‚Äôs cool, fatherhood‚Äôs sick‚Äù.

Goddard is more ambivalent. ‚ÄúMy coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.‚Äù Spearman says Everything Everything didn‚Äôt want to mention fatherhood ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in the press release for their new album, ‚Äúbecause it makes us look a bit old. And it‚Äôs a bit of cliche to be like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve written a record about having a kid,‚Äô which is not what our record is about. We don‚Äôt want to overstate it.‚Äù

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven‚Äôt noticed any real-world implications yet. ‚ÄúWe got playlisted on Radio 1,‚Äù he says happily. ‚ÄúNot bad for a dad band!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
411,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite ‚Äì it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It‚Äôs the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I‚Äôve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I‚Äôve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali‚Äôs fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis‚Äô days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone‚Äôs view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn‚Äôt show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I‚Äôd show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn‚Äôt have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy ‚Äì most photographers don‚Äôt hang around the magazine‚Äôs photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn‚Äôt mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali‚Äôs head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali‚Äôs next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you‚Äôd ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there ‚Äì I went with him once. They‚Äôd wind him up saying: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!‚Äù He‚Äôd reply: ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôd have had him in two rounds!‚Äù

I can count on one hand the athletes I‚Äôve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson‚Äôs disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist‚Äôs ear ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We‚Äôd do a studio shot and he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you 20 minutes‚Äù ‚Äì then an hour later he‚Äôd still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better ‚Äì maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I‚Äôve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

412,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. ‚ÄúTo come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,‚Äù he said.

Watt‚Äôs photographs of the forest ‚Äì and the grim aftermath of logging ‚Äì are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the ‚Äúgraveyard of stumps‚Äù in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we‚Äôre allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people are shocked that that‚Äôs still happening here. It‚Äôs not illegal. The government sanctions it.‚Äù

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province‚Äôs southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island‚Äôs original old growth forests ‚Äì where Watt shot his before-and-after series ‚Äì are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) ‚Äì or about 1% of the deferred areas ‚Äì is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,‚Äù said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. ‚ÄúThat means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.‚Äù

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep taking these ‚Äòbefore‚Äô photos,‚Äù said Watt. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs up to politicians if there‚Äôs going to be an ‚Äòafter‚Äô shot.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
413,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan‚Äôs Netflix epic. Firstly, it‚Äôs just as well The Crown isn‚Äôt on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation‚Äôs enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman‚Äôs Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia ‚Äì not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there‚Äôs nothing. Well, there‚Äôs Prince Charles but Josh O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons‚Äô Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn‚Äôt so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen‚Äôs children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana‚Äôs arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù on offer. It‚Äôs a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts ‚Äì for example, there‚Äôs no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II‚Äôs sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn‚Äôt they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling ‚Äì which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed ‚Äúfairytale‚Äù wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it‚Äôs simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there‚Äôs no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures ‚Äì such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II‚Äôs successor refusing to sign a bill into law ‚Äì or mined Britain‚Äôs deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV‚Äôs Victoria and BBC/Showtime‚Äôs The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you‚Äôre watching. In the latest series, there‚Äôs a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew ‚Äì then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal ‚Äì talks to the Queen about his private life. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù she later reflects to her husband. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt change ‚Ä¶‚Äù The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function ‚Äì and the aesthetics ‚Äì of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple‚Äôs courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4‚Äôs comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show‚Äôs writers have recognised that she doesn‚Äôt belong in that world ‚Äì a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it‚Äôs obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there‚Äôs a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic ‚Äì the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period ‚Äì the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there‚Äôs a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan‚Äôs withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations ‚Äì of royals and commoners alike ‚Äì might well wonder whether it‚Äôs all worth it.

414,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you‚Äôre going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They‚Äôve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It‚Äôs too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That‚Äôs fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs not right. They‚Äôve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don‚Äôt have all the best words to do this because I‚Äôm angry. And the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job ‚Ä¶ in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he‚Äôs one of the better ones they‚Äôve got. His family‚Äôs getting harassed now. There‚Äôs a noose out there with his name on it, and it‚Äôs just not right.

I‚Äôve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It‚Äôs just wrong. I can‚Äôt begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

415,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government‚Äôs ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It‚Äôs both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I‚Äôve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I‚Äôm torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year‚Äôs Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn‚Äôt going to stop transmission. It‚Äôs best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you‚Äôre likely to smell the smoke. It‚Äôs the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area ‚Äì the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you‚Äôre not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they‚Äôre not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government‚Äôs decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn‚Äôt worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I‚Äôm less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
416,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever ‚Äúour‚Äù is and whenever that ‚Äúday‚Äù might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: ‚ÄúOh God, we‚Äôre doing anarchism at the moment ‚Äì it‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism‚Äôs central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there‚Äôs a T-shirt slogan there, I‚Äôm sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father‚Äôs wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. ‚ÄúOf course she wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening‚Äôs source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter‚Äôs adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

‚ÄúHow are you doing, Ryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù he said happily. ‚ÄúLiving the dream.‚Äù

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself ‚Äúto the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active‚Äù. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a ‚Äúmisconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There‚Äôs definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we‚Äôve got a few Thatcherites in our class.‚Äù

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren‚Äôt born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs everything, isn‚Äôt it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.‚Äù Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this ¬£17,000-a-year establishment, she said: ‚ÄúThere were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I‚Äôve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.‚Äù No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that‚Äôs quite a start. ‚ÄúThings have deteriorated quite significantly since then,‚Äù he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it‚Äôs never like that.‚Äù

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of ‚Äúreal‚Äù politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it ‚Äúinteresting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.‚Äù

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view ‚Äì or those of your tribe ‚Äì and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: ‚ÄúNothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.‚Äù

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

417,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it,[],"When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday‚Äôs news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours ‚Äì a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn‚Äôt really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government‚Äôs proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone ‚Äì regardless of nationality or political affiliation ‚Äì is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
418,The Guardian view on Poland‚Äôs Catholics: losing faith in their church | Editorial,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Krak√≥w, Marek Jƒôdraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the European Union‚Äôs Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù clause, Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a ‚Äúneo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God‚Äôs kingdom‚Äù. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender ‚Äúideology‚Äù in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October‚Äôs controversial abortion ruling by Poland‚Äôs constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops‚Äô conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS‚Äôs leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, called on Poles to ‚Äúdefend the church at any price‚Äù. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church‚Äôs authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II‚Äôs judgment was criticised in last month‚Äôs Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope‚Äôs secretary, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church‚Äôs steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczy≈Ñski, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to ‚Äúabandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance‚Äù. Their statement denounced attempts to ‚Äúexploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party‚Äù. If the country‚Äôs ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
419,Covid has shown me what lies beyond boredom: post-boredom,[],"I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. ‚ÄúGood, thanks. You?‚Äù I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. ‚ÄúWhat did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, umm ‚Ä¶ got really into jigsaws for a bit. Rearranged the spare room into an office. Learned to make this one really good curry recipe from the BBC website. Uh ‚Ä¶ got 11 solo wins and about 24 duo wins on Fortnite.‚Äù Is that good?, they‚Äôll ask, and I‚Äôll have to admit that no, not particularly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game for 12-year-olds that I play compulsively,‚Äù I‚Äôll explain. ‚ÄúEvery day I log in and let adolescents embarrass me in an online world that allows them to dance joyously on the remains of my corpse.‚Äù Oh, they‚Äôll say. I think there‚Äôs something ‚Äì I think there‚Äôs something happening in the other room. I really ought to‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs important to address the fact that I am bored. I am, to my bones, bored of this. I know that in the current climate, being bored is a high luxury, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any more thrilling. In fact, I am so deep into boredom that I have burrowed beneath the previously accepted boundaries of the concept, and have now emerged, apathetically, into post-boredom.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a ‚Äúsign of a life falling apart‚Äù to something I was doing ‚Äúfor the moral good of the country and the world as a whole‚Äù, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I‚Äôd thrive in the ambient boredom of prison ‚Äì not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I‚Äôd get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That‚Äôs not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one ‚Äì no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing ‚Äì but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it‚Äôs psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it‚Äôs possibly even worse that we‚Äôve worn boredom down to the bone. If we‚Äôve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself ‚Äì someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something ‚Äì the answer can only be ‚Äúchaos‚Äù.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won‚Äôt be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much ‚Äì stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it‚Äôs hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We‚Äôre all tiptoeing around the idea that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It‚Äôs hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I‚Äôm certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

420,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we‚Äôve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world‚Äôs human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We‚Äôve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some ¬£1.5bn of the UK‚Äôs commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it‚Äôs coming under threat from the government‚Äôs proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don‚Äôt yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map ‚Äì it‚Äôs also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged ¬£7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world‚Äôs most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested ¬£12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed ¬£120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network‚Äôs priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We‚Äôve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, ‚ÄúAntimicrobial resistance ‚Ä¶ threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily‚Äù. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK‚Äôs track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government‚Äôs decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

421,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you‚Äôve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of ‚ÄúDivine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.‚Äù

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn‚Äôt include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for those who haven‚Äôt seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit ‚Äì it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there ‚Äì but somehow it didn‚Äôt really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone‚Äôs accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%‚Äôs mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren‚Äôt one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It‚Äôs weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on ‚Äì giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
422,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found the game cathartic",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix‚Äôs series The Queen‚Äôs Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I‚Äôd ever played anyone, I‚Äôd lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I‚Äôm more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I‚Äôd never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it‚Äôs exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I‚Äôve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other ‚Äì sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny‚Äôs funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they‚Äôd ever known.

But it isn‚Äôt always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny‚Äôs escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was ‚Äì he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I‚Äôd been playing chess for a few months ‚Äì first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online ‚Äì I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I‚Äôd started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He‚Äôs the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It‚Äôs a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

428,Fans are back! But avoid using toilets during peak times,[],"THE RETURN OF PROPER FOOTBALL

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage ‚Äúfootball without fans is nothing‚Äù is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we‚Äôd either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we‚Äôd have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven‚Äôt done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn‚Äôt it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid ‚Äúunnecessary movement‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, without having to purchase a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal‚Äôs poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we‚Äôll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language.

429,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC‚Äôs decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúverification‚Äù from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

‚ÄúThe shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,‚Äù a BBC spokesperson said. ‚ÄúOn this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.‚Äù

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

‚ÄúThis is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I‚Äôve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don‚Äôt vote.‚Äù

Fury‚Äôs initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury‚Äôs team offered a farmer ¬£25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4 ‚Äî TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 2, 2020

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements ‚Äì citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury‚Äôs team to lie. Fury‚Äôs subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as ‚Äútotal bullshit‚Äù.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury ‚Äì who earlier that year had claimed that ‚Äúthere are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.‚Äù

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn‚Äôt changed his mind. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy it one bit,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hamilton, who won the award in 2014 and has finished in the top three a record five times, is as short as 1-7 with the bookmakers after winning his seventh F1 title.

Fury, who retained his WBC heavyweight title by knocking out Deontay Wilder, is the second favourite, slightly ahead of O‚ÄôSullivan, who won his sixth world title at the Crucible.

Doyle, who broke her own record for the number of winners ridden by a British woman in a year in 2020, said she was delighted at being shortlisted.

‚ÄúIt is a huge privilege to be nominated for such an illustrious award,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to get my head around being nominated alongside the likes of Lewis Hamilton, but I‚Äôm really pleased that horse racing has been recognised alongside these sports.‚Äù

The 24-year-old, who also rode her first Royal Ascot winner and became the first woman to ride five winners on the same card at odds of 899-1 at Windsor in August, said: ‚ÄúRacing can be in its own little bubble as such, so hopefully this might help to open the door to a wider audience.‚Äù

431,"Mick Schumacher's family name is blessing and a curse, says Damon Hill",[],"Damon Hill has said Mick Schumacher deserves his shot at Formula One success but has warned the son of the seven-times world champion Michael that living up to a family name can be both a blessing and a curse.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill‚Äôs father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher‚Äôs F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

‚ÄúThere is a sense that some people don‚Äôt want you to have a go,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI felt like some people felt: ‚ÄòWhy is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.‚Äô It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.‚Äù

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

‚ÄúI wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad‚Äôs life and career and applied them to my racing.

‚ÄúJacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.‚Äù

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

‚ÄúIt really is tragic what happened to Michael,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.‚Äù

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

‚ÄúI have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.‚Äù

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher‚Äôs best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

‚ÄúIn a way it‚Äôs very simple ‚Äì if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
432,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed ‚Äúill-judged criticism‚Äù from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been ‚Äúconvicted of racism‚Äù.

Porto‚Äôs move came after City drew 0-0 at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as ‚Äúan opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism‚Äù.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: ‚ÄúHis tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.‚Äù

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto‚Äôs coach Sergio Concei√ß√£o accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Concei√ß√£o described Silva as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù for a tweet that followed City‚Äôs victory in which the midfielder wrote: ‚ÄúThis one felt so good!‚Äù

Porto‚Äôs newsletter claimed Guardiola had a ‚Äúbad disposition after the meeting‚Äù on Tuesday and quoted Concei√ß√£o as saying: ‚ÄúI would also be upset if I couldn‚Äôt win with the team he has and the budget he has.‚Äù

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: ‚ÄúDespite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt buy class or notion.‚Äù In response a City spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

‚ÄúIn 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.‚Äù

The incident referred to came at the Drag√£o in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City‚Äôs XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: ‚ÄúStrange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn‚Äôt going to work.

433,LeBron James' $88m contract extension opens possibility of playing alongside son,[],"LeBron James, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to their first NBA title in a decade earlier this year, has agreed a two-year contract extension worth $88m, opening the possibility of him playing in the league at the same time as his son.

James‚Äôs agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James‚Äôs contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year‚Äôs NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration

In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus.

The streets of Arguinegu√≠n, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon.

Almost 15 years after the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees.

Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018.

Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguinegu√≠n. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguinegu√≠n, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309.

The people held at the temporary centre ‚Äì officially for a maximum of 72 hours ‚Äì are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms.

There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents.

Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system.

Spain‚Äôs public ombudsman has called for the Arguinegu√≠n camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people‚Äôs basic rights.

Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mog√°n, of which Arguinegu√≠n is a part.

Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island‚Äôs capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay.

While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will.

‚ÄúThis lack of humanity from the government just can‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.‚Äù

And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù in 2006.

Jos√© Segura Clavell, who was the central government‚Äôs representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the ‚Äúhumanitarian reception‚Äù to which they are entitled.

If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs behaviour is a mistake,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a clear common policy.‚Äù

The lack of a clear, common ‚Äì and fair ‚Äì approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU‚Äôs new migration and asylum proposals.

‚ÄúWe believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,‚Äù the four countries said.

‚ÄúThe frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.‚Äù

In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguinegu√≠n dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people ‚Äì including more than 455 unaccompanied children ‚Äì are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mog√°n.

But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that ‚ÄúMog√°n‚Äôs solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December‚Äù and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere.

The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after.

‚ÄúIf I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,‚Äù Jalloul said on Thursday.

‚ÄúDo you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?‚Äù

Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry ‚Äì which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible ‚Äì says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks.

Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October ‚Äúin search of a future‚Äù. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister.

But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home.

Kamara says the Canaries ‚Äì ‚Äúa great place‚Äù ‚Äì remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off.

‚ÄúI was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,‚Äù says Kamara.

Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with.

The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain.

For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp ‚Äújust goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago‚Äù.

Like many others ‚Äì not least the regional president of the Canaries ‚Äì Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, ‚Äúviews island territories as prisons‚Äù.

But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries.

In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into.

‚ÄúUntil we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we‚Äôre going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,‚Äù says Santana.

‚ÄúThere will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
437,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain‚Äôs new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her ‚Äúdelight, after many years of campaigning,‚Äù that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens‚Äô right to work and live in UK ‚Äì a key Brexit ask ‚Äì or British nationals‚Äô right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

‚ÄúIt will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,‚Äù said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. ‚ÄúI built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is ‚Ä¶ a shock.‚Äù

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell‚Äôs mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and ‚Äì like his sister ‚Äì two dual-nationality children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very settled; we have careers and families,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not thinking of going home yet.‚Äù

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. ‚ÄúMy big worry is my mother,‚Äù Frizell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fit and well, but if she needed looking after ‚Ä¶ Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now ‚Äì but not for much longer.‚Äù

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, ‚Äúalmost without restriction‚Äù.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù Godfrey said, ‚Äúif you want to come back with your non-British partner, you‚Äôll need to earn ¬£18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they‚Äôll have to meet the new points system.‚Äù

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs ‚Äì NHS surcharges, fees ‚Äì could run into thousands of pounds.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a massive change,‚Äù said Godfrey. ‚ÄúIt basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it‚Äôs asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible choice, and it‚Äôs really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.‚Äù

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. ‚ÄúThe government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.‚Äù

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. ‚ÄúThe government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúWe just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we‚Äôre not talking about a never-ending stream of people ‚Äì it‚Äôs a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It‚Äôs just nonsense.‚Äù

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home ‚Äì and if we don‚Äôt move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It‚Äôs hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.‚Äù

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship ‚Äì but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

‚ÄúIf we wanted to move back we‚Äôd have to go through so many hoops now,‚Äù Woodford said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not sure we‚Äôd meet the minimum income. It‚Äôs seems unfathomable to me ‚Ä¶ Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.‚Äù

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband ‚Äúcould not possibly decide by March 2022‚Äù whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

‚ÄúBut how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years ‚Äì she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that‚Äôs been taken away.‚Äù

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

‚ÄúBrexit means I can‚Äôt do that now, because I don‚Äôt yet have a full residence permit, so I can‚Äôt leave Greece for more than three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that‚Äôs not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.‚Äù

The couple would be ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. ‚ÄúIt just seems so sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people‚Äôs choices taken away ‚Äì all those things my generation could do ‚Ä¶ And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.‚Äù

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

‚ÄúDaniel may want to come back ‚Äì not yet, certainly, but at some stage,‚Äù Barbara said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn‚Äôt look very fair or equal to me.‚Äù

438,"'If the EU says we can‚Äôt open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni‚Äôs grandmother Adelina began the family‚Äôs ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

‚ÄúI have never not known a ski season,‚Äù said Di Bendinoni. ‚ÄúEven the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.‚Äù

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Gernot Bl√ºmel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

‚ÄúIn Italy we‚Äôre in limbo, when you don‚Äôt know what will happen from one day to the next,‚Äù said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni‚Äôs cousin and a ski instructor. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians ‚Äì if the EU says we can‚Äôt open, then they should pay for it.‚Äù

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy‚Äôs third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d‚ÄôOulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgen√®vre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about ‚Ç¨11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere‚Äôs inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

‚ÄúSome got ‚Ç¨600, others ‚Ç¨1,200,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don‚Äôt discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt carry on. We‚Äôre at that level and politicians need to understand.‚Äù

Gianni Poncet, the village‚Äôs mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,‚Äù Poncet said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants ‚Äì across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn‚Äôt begin we will lose ‚Ç¨1bn.‚Äù

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular apr√®s-ski spot, said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.‚Äù

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

‚ÄúEven if people from abroad can‚Äôt come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,‚Äù Giovanni Brasso said. ‚ÄúIn the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.‚Äù

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves ‚Ä¶ and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan‚Äôs parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan‚Äôs soldiers reached the settlement‚Äôs outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

‚ÄúWe expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,‚Äù Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. ‚ÄúNobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,‚Äù Safaryan says.

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

‚ÄúWhen we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúEven after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äô It never happened.‚Äù

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

‚ÄúI was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,‚Äù she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. ‚ÄúGeographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.‚Äù

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. ‚ÄúArmenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúWe had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn‚Äôt trustful coexistence.‚Äù

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. ‚ÄúI asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLater we learned it was about unification with Armenia.‚Äù

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. ‚ÄúWe said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúWe even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.‚Äù

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. ‚ÄúSlowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúOne day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,‚Äù Hajiyeva recalls. ‚ÄúAfter that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.‚Äù

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. ‚ÄúI opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,‚Äù she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúMy parents just woke up and realised war had begun.‚Äù

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. ‚ÄúSome days they couldn‚Äôt even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúThey were very bad, very harsh days.‚Äù

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan‚Äôs favour.

‚ÄúThe whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,‚Äù she claims. ‚ÄúThey left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.‚Äù

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh‚Äôs Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan‚Äôs parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. ‚ÄúThey are just existing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what we are going to do.‚Äù

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúSome people were saying, why have you left your city?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.‚Äù

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. ‚ÄúThe house has survived the occupation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what‚Äôs happening in my city.‚Äù

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. ‚ÄúMy friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always prepared myself that once I‚Äôll be back in Shusha, I‚Äôll start my new life from zero.‚Äù

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. ‚ÄúI cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,‚Äù Hajizada said. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.‚Äù

440,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel‚Äôs parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday‚Äôs vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz‚Äôs Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday‚Äôs bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country‚Äôs longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

‚ÄúNetanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,‚Äù Gantz said. ‚ÄúShow me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: ‚ÄúNetanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.‚Äù

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. ‚ÄúNow is not the time for elections,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúNow is the time for unity.‚Äù

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu‚Äôs ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

‚ÄúI was well aware of his track record as a ‚Äòserial promise-breaker‚Äô, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gantz said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúNetanyahu didn‚Äôt lie to me ‚Äì he lied to all of you.‚Äù

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,‚Äù Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

‚Äú[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,‚Äù wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

‚ÄúThe prime minister‚Äôs ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù slogans like ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

‚ÄúYou lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you‚Äôre actually going to get the changes you want done,‚Äù the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

Here's what interviewing voters taught me about the slogan 'defund the police' | Danny Barefoot Read more

‚ÄúThe key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?‚Äù Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important ‚Äúnew blood‚Äù in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äì who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president‚Äôs interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats ‚Äì including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù was not about mere words but a ‚Äúdemand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a ‚Äòslogan‚Äô,‚Äù said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge ‚Äì ultimately unsuccessfully ‚Äì the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs seat in the November election.

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù was ‚Äúnot a slogan. It‚Äôs a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Mr President ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about losing people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We‚Äôre losing our loved ones to police violence.‚Äù

The Black Lives Matter movement member‚Äôs rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police ‚Äì a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health ‚Äì factors that contribute to crime.

The former president‚Äôs comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) Damn, Mr. President.



Didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúTrayvon could‚Äôve been my son?‚Äù

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden‚Äôs flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

‚ÄúIf you instead say ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs reform the police department so that everybody‚Äôs being treated fairly,‚Äô‚Äù Clyburn offered alternatively. ‚ÄúNot just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?‚Äô‚Äù

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

‚ÄúShe speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,‚Äù he said, adding that across political ideologies ‚Äúnew blood is always good‚Äù for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
442,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, ‚Äúproductivity score‚Äù, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators ‚Äúhelp their people get the most‚Äù from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

‚ÄúAt Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,‚Äù Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe also believe that privacy is a human right, and we‚Äôre deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.‚Äù

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren‚Äôt contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. ‚ÄúGoing forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level ‚Äì providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,‚Äù Spataro says. ‚ÄúNo one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. ‚ÄúProductivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,‚Äù Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern workforce transformation‚Äù unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

‚ÄúThe thing I love most about Microsoft is that when we screw up, we acknowledge the error and fix it,‚Äù Snover tweeted. ‚Äú10,000 thanks to Wolfie Christl and others for the feedback which led to this change!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
443,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don‚Äôt count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor‚Äôs note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board ‚Äúeroded the public trust in legitimate service animals‚Äù.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people ‚Äúfraudulently representing their pets as service animals‚Äù, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog‚Äôs health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can‚Äôt bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned ‚Äúpit bull type dogs‚Äù in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, ‚ÄúAt this time, there are no changes to Delta‚Äôs current service and support animal policies.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
444,"Covid could derail efforts to eradicate malaria in Pacific, health experts warn",[],"The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

‚ÄúThere are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.‚Äù

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

‚ÄúBut it is malaria that can explode the fastest ‚Äì it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‚Äòcanary in the coalmine‚Äô that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.‚Äù

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia‚Äôs interest.

And a similar proportion ‚Äì 56% ‚Äì believe that if Australia doesn‚Äôt support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

‚ÄúAs a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.‚Äù

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

‚ÄúAustralians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours ‚Ä¶ indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.‚Äù

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia ‚Äúshould these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs‚Äù.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia‚Äôs vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

‚ÄúDoes Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?‚Äù national director Sam Klintworth wrote. ‚ÄúThis equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.‚Äù

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should ‚Äúexplicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia‚Äù.

Last month, a panel of UN public health experts urged governments not to hoard vaccine supplies and called on pharmaceutical companies to share technologies and expertise so all countries can access treatments equally.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad‚Äôs ‚Äúlieutenant‚Äù in a scheme to hide up to ¬£453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a ¬£30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was ‚Äústressed and scared‚Äù about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister‚Äôs home in Russia.

‚ÄúI got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams ‚Ä¶ harassing me. I‚Äôm drinking a lot,‚Äù he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I was on the streets ‚Ä¶ [But] I‚Äôm not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúnot hiding‚Äù in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings ‚Äúway in excess‚Äù of the ¬£3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that ¬£3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter‚Äôs mother had become accustomed. ‚ÄúNow maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it‚Äôs different,‚Äù he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her ¬£453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the ¬£30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son‚Äôs emails.

Akhmedova‚Äôs legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband‚Äôs ¬£300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club‚Äôs owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day‚Äôs work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have money in the budget to pay for contributors.‚Äù Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a ‚Äúdecent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name‚Äù, which would help boost the band‚Äôs following on Instagram and Facebook.

‚ÄúHopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,‚Äù they were told by the show‚Äôs producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians‚Äô Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: ‚ÄúThe days of ‚Äòit‚Äôll give you exposure‚Äô (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won‚Äôt get any gigs these days and we won‚Äôt sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production ‚Ä¶ They want us and our expertise, but they won‚Äôt pay for it.‚Äù

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: ‚ÄúLike all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven‚Äôt raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven‚Äôt monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

‚ÄúWe do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than ¬£20,000 a year, is a pittance.‚Äù

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly‚Äôs hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: ‚ÄúExternally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.‚Äù

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: ‚ÄúAs we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn‚Äôt happen for editorial reasons.‚Äù

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: ‚ÄúHad they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste‚Äôs fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share ¬£12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery‚Äôs story as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to ¬£3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at ¬£3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a ¬£770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a ¬£3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

449,Nike Japan ad on teenage bullying and racism sparks debate,[],"A video made by Nike Japan that explores bullying and racism using three schoolgirl footballers has sparked praise and outrage online, including calls to boycott the company‚Äôs products.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù and beautiful,‚Äù but others were less impressed.

While the film‚Äôs message clearly riled members of Japan‚Äôs online right ‚Äì many of whom commented using pseudonyms ‚Äì more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

‚ÄúIs Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you‚Äôre creating a false impression of Japan,‚Äù said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: ‚ÄúNowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that‚Äôs prejudiced is Nike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so much fun to blame Japan?‚Äù another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country‚Äôs multiracial rugby team at last year‚Äôs world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn‚Äôt Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the ‚Äúzainichi problem‚Äù ‚Äì a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are ‚Äústaying in Japan‚Äù.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world‚Äôs highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka‚Äôs sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she ‚Äúlooked sunburned‚Äù and ‚Äúneeded some bleach‚Äù.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

‚ÄúWe have long listened to minority voices, supported and spoken for causes that fit our values,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe believe sports have the power to show what a better world looks like, to bring people together and encourage action in their respective communities.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
450,World is ‚Äòdoubling down‚Äô on fossil fuels despite climate crisis ‚Äì UN report,[],"The world‚Äôs governments are ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid ‚Äúsevere climate disruption‚Äù. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThe pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,‚Äù said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

‚ÄúAlas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of zombie energy.‚Äù

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: ‚ÄúWith governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year‚Äôs devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,‚Äù said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (¬£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world‚Äôs fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we‚Äôre beginning to see that happen,‚Äù said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: ‚ÄúWorking together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.‚Äù

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: ‚ÄúGovernments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies ‚Äì this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we‚Äôre going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.‚Äù

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to ‚Äúshow climate leadership‚Äù by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: ‚ÄúThe world ‚Äì and its people ‚Äì are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
451,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‚Äòone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äô and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called ‚Äúone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äù.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised ‚Äúthe devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire‚Äù.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the ‚Äúalarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity‚Äù including the decline in New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and MƒÅori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must ‚Äúact with urgency‚Äù.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

‚ÄúThis declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.‚Äù

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service‚Äôs buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the ‚Äúsignificant progress on meeting the challenge‚Äù by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation ‚Äì which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äì made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and had become ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. ‚ÄúThe irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.‚Äù

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: ‚Äú[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs declaration also said the government will ‚Äúdemonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government‚Äôs own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025‚Äù.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs all very well to declare an emergency but there‚Äôs no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,‚Äù Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government‚Äôs fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation‚Äôs biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand‚Äôs pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
452,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world‚Äôs coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world‚Äôs biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries ‚Äì Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal ‚Äì will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction ‚Äì known as exclusive economic zones ‚Äì are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.‚Äù

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: ‚ÄúAustralians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods ‚Ä¶ When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.‚Äù

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world‚Äôs oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was ‚Äúa really big deal‚Äù and could restore the health of the world‚Äôs oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

‚ÄúWhat you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it‚Äôs not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant ‚Äì business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe oceans are in a very sorry state right now.‚Äù

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.‚Äù

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: ‚ÄúIf we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.‚Äù

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world‚Äôs oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of ‚Äúghost‚Äù fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a ‚Äúcircular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik √ñsterblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: ‚Äú[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.‚Äù

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world‚Äôs oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ‚ÄúThe UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing ‚Äì a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other‚Äôs perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls ‚Äì meaning that they push their joypad‚Äôs thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen ‚Äì the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not per se a topic we‚Äôd study in our lab, we‚Äôd had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,‚Äù explains Corbett. ‚ÄúThis was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.‚Äù

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? ‚ÄúGenerally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúThere are no right or wrong answers in these tasks ‚Äì we‚Äôre interested in how people might perform differently. We‚Äôll obtain one or two measures ‚Äì for example, average reaction time, average accuracy ‚Äì from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.‚Äù

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual‚Äôs visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. ‚ÄúFor example,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.‚Äù

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúMost research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can‚Äôt really process more than a few details at once. There‚Äôs a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.‚Äù

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what‚Äôs on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

‚ÄúSuch findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‚Äòreal‚Äô flight consoles,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúIn a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.‚Äù

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

‚Ä¢ Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

454,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace ‚Äì review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain ‚Äì and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens ‚Äì all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don‚Äôt ‚Äì because, obviously, they weren‚Äôt allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen‚Äôs pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art ‚Äì and this collection ‚Äì to HM using the term ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù. This old school art snob would no more have said ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù than he‚Äôd have said ‚Äútaken to Twitter‚Äù. He‚Äôd have said ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù or ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen‚Äôs Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection‚Äôs finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I‚Äôve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt‚Äôs rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam‚Äôs Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar‚Äôs anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he‚Äôs studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They‚Äôre consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing ‚Ä¶ Rembrandt‚Äôs Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / ¬© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I‚Äôll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It‚Äôs hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here‚Äôs the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He‚Äôd recently lost his wife. A friend ‚Äì thought to be William, Lord Crofts ‚Äì is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck‚Äôs mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer‚Äôs surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they‚Äôre in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It‚Äôs either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens‚Äôs personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There‚Äôs a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi‚Äôs Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show ‚Äì she painted it for Charles I ‚Äì and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection‚Äôs virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I‚Äôm grateful that some of the royal family‚Äôs treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It‚Äôs hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

Well, as much as you can be trapped in one of the safest places in the world.

I‚Äôve spent most of 2020 walking around in the woods alone in the day, and scrolling through the internet to check the rest of the world is still there at night. It‚Äôs been nice but I am probably getting a bit of a Jack Torrance vibe.

London and New Zealand are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I haven‚Äôt been home to Australia in years and by now I‚Äôm homesick enough that I‚Äôd probably fall to my knees at the mere waft of a sausage. In the spirit of patriotism, I‚Äôve quarantined this list to the Aussie corner of the internet.

‚ÄòThis country is facing an existential crisis.‚Äô

Writing on Mad As Hell was one of the best jobs I‚Äôve ever gotten to do and I miss working with the team and cast. I‚Äôve really loved watching how they tackled 2020 restrictions and I‚Äôm extremely glad that they were allowed to keep producing the show this year. This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

Engineering numbers.

Speaking of Mad As Hell, Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews are two of the best sketch writers I‚Äôve ever gotten to work with. This is the intro clip for their show MAGMA, which you can go and watch on demand here https://sospresents.com/ along with other incredible Australian comedians like Double Denim and Jude Perl.

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‚ÄòI will just warn you before I go any further ...‚Äô

As a comic it‚Äôs hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She‚Äôs just so good.

The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There‚Äôs the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles ‚Äì swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

It‚Äôs impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney‚Äôs 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor‚Äôs career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland‚Äôs closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams‚Äôs Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there‚Äôs winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom ‚Äì Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor‚Äôs preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor‚Äôs self-centered ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù feels earned. But Godmothered‚Äôs tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother‚Äôs overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there‚Äôs one ‚Äì co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) ‚Äì within reach), but its shoehorned revelation ‚Äì that true loves comes in many forms ‚Äì is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious ‚Äì unrealistic in the parts where it‚Äôs trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor‚Äôs misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a bumpy, underwhelming ride ‚Äì not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
457,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world ‚Äì it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‚ÄòLast night,‚Äù says Laima Leyton, ‚ÄúI went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramoviƒá. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn‚Äôt have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.‚Äù

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists ‚Äì Leyton among them ‚Äì about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly‚Äôs condemnation of petty domesticity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall‚Äù ‚Äì and Tracey Emin‚Äôs oft-quoted line: ‚ÄúThere are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.‚Äù

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,‚Äù painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer‚Äôs wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report‚Äôs data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that‚Äôs not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists‚Äô careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn‚Äôt factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world ‚Äì motherhood. My resulting essay ‚Äì Full, Messy and Beautiful ‚Äì was published alongside this year‚Äôs report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

‚ÄúMy experience,‚Äù Anna Perach told me, ‚Äúis that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‚Äòsold out‚Äô or joined the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.‚Äù

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with ‚Äúthe holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids‚Äù, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can‚Äôt be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn‚Äôt come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn‚Äôt have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? ‚ÄúPaying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,‚Äù said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There‚Äôs now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities ‚Äì buzz, aura, image ‚Äì there is quite simply a problem of perception. ‚ÄúWomen artists are marginalised generally,‚Äù as Jemima Burrill put it. ‚ÄúMothers are almost beyond the pale.‚Äù

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are ‚Äì and have been ‚Äì great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù that a woman cannot excel as both.

458,"Faith review ‚Äì compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains ‚Äúwarrior monks‚Äù in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks‚Äô daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white ‚Äì it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn‚Äôt help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there‚Äôs no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions ‚Äì five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken ‚Äì to fuel his narcissism and ego, I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I‚Äôd like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

459,‚ÄòAs consumers we all have tremendous impact‚Äô: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we‚Äôre on if we‚Äôre to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you‚Äôre a climate science denier, you‚Äôll be familiar with ‚Äì and anxious to see something done about ‚Äì a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive ‚Äì going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚Äì the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it‚Äôs from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The ‚Äúnatural carbon storage‚Äù of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft‚Äôs target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it‚Äôs a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs a mindset,‚Äù says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. ‚ÄúWe decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We‚Äôre embracing the challenge.‚Äù

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations ‚Äì ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it‚Äôs the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion‚Äôs share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,‚Äô says Henkel‚Äôs Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company‚Äôs direct influence presents challenges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúTake our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can‚Äôt make you switch your energy supplier. But it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.‚Äù

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel‚Äôs global carbon footprint ‚Äì just 2% compared with Ikea‚Äôs 11%, for example ‚Äì the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.‚Äù

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites ‚Äì both thermal and photovoltaic ‚Äì any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company‚Äôs plans.

‚ÄúIf we have the right energy infrastructure in place ‚Äì similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montorn√®s del Vall√®s in Spain, for example ‚Äì we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,‚Äù says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory ‚Äì so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúToday, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It‚Äôs quite a dramatic progress.‚Äù Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: ‚ÄúThe classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it‚Äôs too easy to do right now.‚Äù Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. ‚ÄúThe capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,‚Äù Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. ‚ÄúWe have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,‚Äù says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: ‚ÄúOur products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers ‚Äì and ultimately consumers ‚Äì save energy and carbon.‚Äù

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. ‚ÄúYou, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúDo I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?‚Äù

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. ‚ÄúVideo-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,‚Äù says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. ‚ÄúLaundry won‚Äôt complain if you wash it cold, so that‚Äôs easier. Your clothes will last longer and your electricity bill will be lower,‚Äù says Bergmann, adding that decades of research has enabled Henkel to produce detergents that function at these lower temperatures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about generating a good value proposition ‚Äì the behavioural change will follow.‚Äù

For all the company‚Äôs good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat. The first step to combating this is having a clear breakdown of our own carbon footprints. ‚ÄúThis transparency enables us to make informed choices,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe all need to take gradual steps, rather than just seeing an overwhelming target that we‚Äôll struggle to achieve.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
460,‚ÄòThe holy grail of packaging recycling‚Äô: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there‚Äôs one thing the British public likes to complain about, it‚Äôs recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn‚Äôt, where it ends up and who‚Äôs paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn‚Äôt always straightforward. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really hard to identify what kind of material it is,‚Äù says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. ‚ÄúIf the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it‚Äôs covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,‚Äù he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it‚Äôs vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies ‚Äì essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‚ÄòThe objective is to increase farmer incomes‚Äô: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer‚Äôs bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. ‚ÄúThis means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,‚Äù says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it‚Äôs a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. ‚ÄúIt makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today‚Äôs problems in sorting and recycling packaging,‚Äù says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. ‚Äú[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.‚Äù

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product‚Äôs website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. ‚ÄúMaybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],‚Äù he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. ‚ÄúWe are in a very early pioneering phase,‚Äù he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. ‚ÄúEven with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.‚Äù

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold‚Äôs mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. ‚ÄúIt brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,‚Äù he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. ‚ÄúThis means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.‚Äù

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this testing to the next level.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
461,‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green‚Äô: the rise of sustainable hair salons,[],"Small changes such as eco shower heads can make big saving for salons. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. ‚ÄúI think it was my children,‚Äù he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. ‚ÄúAs they‚Äôve gotten older, they‚Äôve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.‚Äù

In the salon‚Äôs new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There‚Äôs a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He‚Äôs also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he‚Äôs already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there‚Äôs been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs added a real buzz to the salon,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú[Clients] feel they‚Äôre doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what‚Äôs going on [in the world].‚Äù

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. ‚ÄúA big turning point was David Attenborough‚Äôs The Blue Planet,‚Äù she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. ‚ÄúI had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green.‚Äô‚Äù

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than ¬£5,000 a year. ‚ÄúThere are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we‚Äôve found a lot of win-wins,‚Äù Baden says. ‚Äú[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients‚Äô behaviour. They‚Äôre connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.‚Äù

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai G√∂rlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel‚Äôs brands. ‚ÄúWe truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,‚Äù he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, G√∂rlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf‚Äôs Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children‚Äôs Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. ‚ÄúHairdressing is a skill, a craft ‚Äì it‚Äôs teachable,‚Äù Ellis says. ‚ÄúSo we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.‚Äù Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. ‚ÄúShe ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed my life.‚Äô It‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. ‚ÄúI felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.‚Äù Many will go on to set up their own businesses ‚Äì Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‚ÄúHe said that it‚Äôs such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,‚Äù G√∂rlitz says of Son. ‚ÄúIn 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.‚Äù And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, G√∂rlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel‚Äôs Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. ‚ÄúShaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.‚Äù

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he‚Äôs felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever, we‚Äôve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That‚Äôs incredible. There‚Äôs been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
462,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue ‚Äì its stickiness ‚Äì is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 ‚Äì the 2020 target is 60% ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind‚Äôs environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: ‚ÄúThe issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.‚Äù

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It‚Äôs things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes ‚Äì generally, anything that doesn‚Äôt spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. ‚ÄúIt costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn‚Äôt collect and sort it,‚Äù he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex‚Äôs goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK‚Äôs circular economy package ‚Äì an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value ‚Äì will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It‚Äôs all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we‚Äôll see a change for flexible packaging then. ‚ÄúWhen the EPR system is launched in 2023, we‚Äôre hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,‚Äù he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won‚Äôt be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time ‚Äì let‚Äôs say cardboard ‚Äì and also for plastics,‚Äù says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel‚Äôs projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. ‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?‚Äô He said he‚Äôd worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!‚Äù

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer ‚Äì often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec‚Äôs technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. ‚ÄúThe debonding allows you to recover more [materials],‚Äù Bankmann says. ‚ÄúIt will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.‚Äù

The adhesives developed with Saperatec‚Äôs recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel‚Äôs RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. ‚ÄúAs the targets go up and we‚Äôre increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,‚Äù he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
463,17 delicious loaf tin recipes (that aren‚Äôt banana bread),[],"A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost ¬£2 ‚Äì even the cheapest model will set you back about ¬£2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough ‚Äì about 900g.

So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity ‚Äì any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin ‚Äì some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner‚Äôs lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin ‚Äì and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.

A good place to start is plain old bread ‚Äì specifically, Dan Lepard‚Äôs sour cream sandwich loaf. While it is possible to knock up endless free-form, rustic loaves at home, the point of the tin is to make bread that in some way resembles the stuff you buy in a shop: sharp-cornered, sandwich friendly, toaster ready. Lepard‚Äôs method relies on a quick knead ‚Äì about 10 seconds ‚Äì repeated at 10 minute intervals, plus a final rise in the tin. In this, and in every recipe here, you would be wise first to line your tin with greaseproof paper, even if the loaf tin in question is non-stick. If you like living dangerously, feel free to ignore this warning and accept the consequences.

Claire Thomson‚Äôs porridge bread makes good use of leftover cold porridge, mixed in with the white flour. For a darker, gluten-free bread, Lepard offers multiseed and molasses bread. Besides molasses (or black treacle), the recipe requires a mix of potato starch, cornflour, rice flour, psyllium husk, egg white and a selection of seeds. But because there is no gluten, there is no need to knead: you end up with a sort of batter that firms itself up as it rises.

Loaf tins are not just for bread ‚Äì you can also use them to make loaf-shaped cakes, a pound cake being one of the best and simplest. Traditionally, pound cake contained a pound of each of the four main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs), but you don‚Äôt need a maths degree to realise that this would overwhelm a 2lb tin. Instead, try this recipe for vanilla pound cake, which calls for 200g of each (that means three eggs), along with a teaspoon of untraditional, but wholly welcome, baking powder.

Drizzle cake is another loaf tin standard. Felicity Cloake‚Äôs perfect version is a close relative to pound cake, with some ground almonds and lemon zest thrown in and, of course, the drizzle. Fergus Henderson‚Äôs seed cake, meanwhile, is one of the few dedicated elevenses recipes out there, best administered with a glass of something while lunch is still a distant prospect. The seed in question is caraway; the something should be madeira.

Rachel Roddy‚Äôs marmalade cake is yet another variation ‚Äì the proportions are the same as for pound cake, although the amounts here suggest a 1lb loaf tin may be a more suitable size. Tamal Ray‚Äôs blood orange syrup loaf is a gluten-free option, using polenta instead of flour. In an emergency, you could profitably employ regular oranges.

Ruby Tandoh‚Äôs blueberry loaf cake is made with yoghurt and almond oil (although she says sunflower oil, with a little added vanilla, works as a substitute). Delia Smith has a recipe for dark Jamaican gingerbread that will allow you to get more use out of that tin of black treacle or molasses you bought to make Lepard‚Äôs bread.

Your loaf tin can also serve as a mould for savoury dishes, most famously meatloaf. There are countless wildly different variations on this classic American dish and I have hit on a few bad ones while trying to recreate the kind my mother made. As ever, it is wisest to rely on Cloake‚Äôs definitive version: after some experimentation, she settles on a recipe containing, among other things, spinach, yoghurt, eggs, garlic, brown sugar and ketchup. If you are looking for something elementary ‚Äì and very much in the humble, no-nonsense spirit of the dish ‚Äì you could have a go at this five-ingredient meatloaf: mince, bacon, sage-and-onion stuffing mix, a beef stock cube and sunflower oil. If you don‚Äôt like the sound of that list, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt like meatloaf.

As far as I am concerned, a terrine tin and a loaf tin are the same thing ‚Äì if you have one, you have both. This means that as soon as you have turned out your bread you can use the tin to whip up a pat√© de campagne. Once again, I am passing on Cloake‚Äôs hard-won expertise, alongside a warning that this will amount to rather more than a lazy afternoon‚Äôs work. Plus, you may have to source some caul fat. Another option is this festive-sounding duck and pork terrine with cranberries and pistachios, which has the advantage of being rather easier to pull together.

A terrine need not be a savoury dish ‚Äì your loaf tin can give shape to all sorts of desserts and puddings. This coffee ice-cream terrine, for example, is made up of layers of coffee and vanilla ice-cream, cemented together with chocolate sauce and left to set hard in the freezer.

Chocolate caramel terrine is another layered pudding ‚Äì this time a caramel, mascarpone, chocolate and cream mixture interspersed with caramel wafers cut to fit your loaf tin. More impressive still is Liam Charles‚Äôs rhubarb and honey panna cotta terrine: a blondie biscuit base with rhubarb jelly on top and panna cotta in between. If you feel uncomfortable making something like that in the same loaf tin you used for meatloaf last week, then I am with you. Best to buy another one for desserts ‚Äì you can get them for about ¬£2.50.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
464,How to make cullen skink ‚Äì recipe,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there‚Äôs anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it‚Äôs the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it‚Äôs too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked ‚Äì to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it‚Äôs not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool ‚Äì take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums ‚Ä¶

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 ‚Ä¶ and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them unless they‚Äôre very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice ‚Äì small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink ‚Äì white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury‚Ä¶

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns ‚Äì steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
465,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she‚Äôd taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. ‚ÄúAnd then the next morning, I just went: ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going out.‚Äô‚Äù She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,‚Äù she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself ‚Äì making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

‚ÄúI started to get those feelings last week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible uneasiness. There‚Äôs this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there‚Äôs a feeling of complete hopelessness.‚Äù There are physical sensations, too ‚Äì her heart races, and she feels hot. ‚ÄúAnd just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.‚Äù Although it‚Äôs tough to experience, it is, she says, ‚Äúa godsend that I know what‚Äôs happening now‚Äù.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, ‚Äúthe usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out‚Äù. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious‚Äù.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we‚Äôre not around the people who might spot something is off ‚Äì our family, friends or colleagues ‚Äì and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

‚ÄòIf you are feeling very sad, you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment.‚Äô Photograph: LaylaBird/Getty Images

‚ÄúFor instance, if you are feeling very sad,‚Äù says Robinson, ‚Äúyou would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you‚Äôre not looking forward to anything in the future. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.‚Äù Instead, says Robinson, ‚Äúask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to‚Äù.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. ‚ÄúNormally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut everyone‚Äôs finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can‚Äôt concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?‚Äù

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we‚Äôre living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? ‚ÄúSo ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?‚Äù Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. ‚ÄúSo the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself ‚Äì and in a limited, more muted way than previously ‚Äì am I still able to motivate myself to see people?‚Äù

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. ‚ÄúAgain, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that‚Äôs a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúBut if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can‚Äôt get things done that need to get done, you can‚Äôt get the shopping in, you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat or you‚Äôre overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can‚Äôt function, these would be warning signs to seek help.‚Äù

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you‚Äôre being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and ‚Äúwhether people find that they‚Äôre excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That‚Äôs a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.‚Äù

‚ÄòAsk yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to.‚Äô Photograph: Christopher Hopefitch/Getty Images

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there‚Äôs a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.‚Äù

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about ‚Äúthriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there‚Äôs that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There‚Äôs more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there‚Äôs an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.‚Äù

The core symptoms of depression, he says, ‚Äúare a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that there‚Äôs definitely a mental health condition.‚Äù It‚Äôs when it becomes pervasive and has an ‚Äúimpact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we‚Äôre becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.‚Äù However, he points out, ‚Äúeverybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what‚Äôs normal for you?‚Äù

‚ÄòI found I wasn‚Äôt reading, and I thought: ‚ÄúThis is very odd.‚Äù‚Äô Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images (Posed by model)

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, ‚ÄúI found that suddenly I wasn‚Äôt reading and I thought: ‚ÄòThis is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?‚Äô I‚Äôd start and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a book.‚Äù A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the guitar since lockdown. It‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, but I can‚Äôt kind of get around to doing it.‚Äù During low periods, ‚ÄúI tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I‚Äôll find excuses why I can‚Äôt see them. So I know that I‚Äôve got to force myself to do something.‚Äù Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people ‚Äúand just be silly‚Äù, but obviously it hasn‚Äôt been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it‚Äôs not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise ‚Äì particularly walking ‚Äì works for her, ‚Äúand cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve failed again, you‚Äôre going back to where you were.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like: ‚ÄòNo, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.‚Äù She would seek help, she says, ‚Äúif it got to the point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage it myself‚Äù.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. ‚ÄúThe charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.‚Äù There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. ‚ÄúI would emphasise that it‚Äôs been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,‚Äù says Obuaya. ‚ÄúTherefore we shouldn‚Äôt make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they‚Äôve got a major mental health problem.‚Äù But, he stresses, there is ‚Äúa range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.‚Äù

466,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you‚Äôve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It‚Äôs most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, ‚Äúlife‚Äù is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I‚Äôve been targeted with ads for ‚Äúface yoga‚Äù, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize ‚Äì $25

Who doesn‚Äôt want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 ‚Äúreps‚Äù a day for 30 days. The beginners‚Äô version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you‚Äôve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a ‚ÄúChad‚Äù ‚Äì a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix ‚Äì $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No ‚Äì she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night‚Äôs sleep.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don‚Äôt suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn‚Äôt stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn‚Äôt to say such strips can‚Äôt be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don‚Äôt think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.‚Äù Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it‚Äôs no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it‚Äôs probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good ‚Äì the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you‚Äôve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

‚ÄúMy first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it‚Äôs not too expensive, it‚Äôs very reasonable to try.‚Äù

So can they work? ‚ÄúIn terms of its actual efficacy it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúReally, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.‚Äù However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth a shot‚Äù.

Upright Go 2 ‚Äì $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you‚Äôve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They‚Äôre right, of course, but it‚Äôs also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you‚Äôve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can‚Äôt roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I‚Äôd recommend it the most.

Manly app ‚Äì $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It‚Äôs simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly‚Äôs suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it‚Äôs been stuffed full of sausages.

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they‚Äôve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are. Meanwhile the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I‚Äôm quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you‚Äôre one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre ‚Äì like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people‚Äôs body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we‚Äôre all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it‚Äôs editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it‚Äôs something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
467,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an ‚Äúexclusively English environment‚Äù.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: ‚ÄúAmongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting ‚Ä¶ and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‚Äòcultural habit‚Äô of visiting ‚Ä¶ There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.‚Äù

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show‚Äôs presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country ‚Äì regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland‚Äôs peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

‚ÄúI found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit ‚Äì I imagine it was all three ‚Äì but it was tough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained ‚Ä¶ but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.‚Äù

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

‚ÄúI realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I‚Äôd come back feeling refreshed ‚Äì ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.‚Äù

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

‚ÄúPeople look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it‚Äôs consistently pointed out to you that you don‚Äôt fit in, or when you don‚Äôt see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn‚Äôt be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.‚Äù

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

‚ÄúPosting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it‚Äôs not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.‚Äù

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go ‚Äì her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and ‚Äúdoing something really physical‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,‚Äù she said.

I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

‚ÄúI needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn‚Äôt just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.‚Äù

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

‚ÄúMany people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside ‚Äì the last bastions of whiteness ‚Äì where it is even less diverse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.‚Äù

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton ‚Äì one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

‚ÄúThere are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.‚Äù

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in ‚Äúgrubby holiday homes‚Äù, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn‚Äôt and so it was kind of non-negotiable ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake ‚Äì we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSometimes I didn‚Äôt even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.‚Äù

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

‚ÄúWith swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you‚Äôve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents ‚Äì all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

‚ÄúThere are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
468,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"After 40 years of marriage, she is looking for a ‚Äòfriend with benefits‚Äô. Where can we find a sexual partner she can trust?

We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a ‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is ‚Äútrust‚Äù. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life ‚Äì finances, work, household, even grooming ‚Äì so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that ‚Äúagreement‚Äù would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would ‚Äì how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent ‚Äì including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established ‚Äúswingers‚Äù community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

470,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a ‚Äúfertility specialist‚Äù in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City‚Äôs first women‚Äôs hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband‚Äôs sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm‚Äôs daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff‚Äôs office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn‚Äôt heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada‚Äôs doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families ‚Äì 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor‚Äôs treatments ‚Äì shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, ‚Äúthe idea of closure is really impossible,‚Äù Hannah Olson, the film‚Äôs director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how ‚Äúpainful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence‚Äù.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records ‚Äì birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives ‚Äì sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora‚Äôs box of secrets. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn‚Äôt the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn‚Äôt the person they thought he was,‚Äù she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized ‚Äì ‚Äúthis was a phenomenon.‚Äù

Baby God initially follows Babst‚Äôs personal investigation, as she retraces her mother‚Äôs steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier‚Äôs former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality ‚Äì a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable ‚Äì has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier‚Äôs previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. ‚ÄúI feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn‚Äôt violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,‚Äù he says in the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still struggling with that. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up.‚Äù

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. ‚ÄúAt first it was like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get all the facts, we‚Äôre going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,‚Äô‚Äù said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction ‚Äì one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier ‚Äì make the doctor‚Äôs deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù attitude, belief that women don‚Äôt need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn‚Äôt become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, ‚Äúwe ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,‚Äù said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film‚Äôs second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier‚Äôs two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline‚Äôs descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case‚Äôs larger, more unsettling questions. ‚ÄúLooking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it‚Äôs always been illegal. It‚Äôs battery, it‚Äôs malpractice, you can‚Äôt put something in someone‚Äôs body without their consent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTowards the end, it became about making peace with one‚Äôs parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?‚Äù The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a ‚Äúvery bizarre case‚Äù to ‚Äúilluminate something that may be universal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just trying to make peace with our parents.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
471,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It‚Äôs the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It‚Äôs now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it‚Äôs honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It‚Äôs a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum‚Äôs executive director.

‚ÄúEven though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,‚Äù said Horsford. ‚ÄúIt can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.‚Äù

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. ‚ÄúThey think, oh we‚Äôre in the north, that wasn‚Äôt an issue here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it‚Äôs a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.‚Äù

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. ‚ÄúPeople who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don‚Äôt say much more,‚Äù she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it‚Äôs a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

‚ÄúWe wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we‚Äôre talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,‚Äù adds Horsford. ‚ÄúWe never want to say: ‚Äòthese people were just slaves,‚Äô because there‚Äôs so much to the story than just that.‚Äù

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm‚Äôs former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

‚ÄúI wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today‚Äôs generations, are human,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.‚Äù

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

‚ÄúWe must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúNot just select people.‚Äù

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the ‚Äúfront parlor‚Äù, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information ‚Äúrelating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room‚Äù, said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúThese images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.‚Äù

Sydlowski‚Äôs work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, ‚Äúcreated specifically for those who were enslaved‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.‚Äù

It captures an ongoing battle. ‚ÄúNew York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,‚Äù said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúMy installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.‚Äù

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúHighlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,‚Äù said Prevost.

‚ÄúToday, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúFollowing our recent election, we‚Äôve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
472,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn‚Äôt know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry‚Äôs book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we‚Äôve diligently followed Barry‚Äôs class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute ‚Äúattendance card‚Äù, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I‚Äôve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

During the pandemic, many activities I love (eating out, visiting friends) are forbidden. I‚Äôm often too anxious to read for any length of time, and writing‚Äôs a challenge. With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn‚Äôt believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn‚Äôt bear to give away. It‚Äôs meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work ‚Äì writing, reporting, teaching ‚Äì I never worry if I‚Äôm doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we‚Äôve exhausted Lynda Barry‚Äôs attendance cards. Now we‚Äôve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity‚Äôs sake, and it‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that‚Äôs unpredictable ‚Äì will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? ‚Äì it feels good to let go of the ‚Äúperfect drawing‚Äù and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who‚Äôd burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I‚Äôd no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn‚Äôt quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I‚Äôm a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I‚Äôm floating in outer space, miles above Earth‚Äôs problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

473,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' ‚Äì the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. ‚ÄúIt seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn‚Äôt believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?‚Äù says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee‚Äôs Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called ‚Äúblack vernacular art‚Äù. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was ‚Äúgoing to change art history‚Äù. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with ‚Äúsongs of sorrow‚Äù from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion ‚Äì quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. ‚ÄúThat the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,‚Äù said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett‚Äôs son, Matt. ‚ÄúThe rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.‚Äù

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett ‚Äì like all the quilters ‚Äì was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt ‚Äì a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 ‚Äì now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters‚Äô work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee‚Äôs Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours ‚Äì typical of the period ‚Äì make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie‚Äôs daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a ‚Äúblock style‚Äù that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. ‚ÄúAs a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they‚Äôd let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,‚Äù she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, ‚Äúbut it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.‚Äù It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee‚Äôs Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw ‚Äì now director of Texas Southern University Museum ‚Äì captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created ‚Äúbetween picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband ‚Ä¶ [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.‚Äù

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts ‚Äì like Qunnie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHousetop‚Äù ‚Äì after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. ‚ÄúNormally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,‚Äù says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. ‚ÄúI do believe that the intentions were good, but I don‚Äôt think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,‚Äù she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It‚Äôs not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren‚Äôt many quilters among the younger generations, she says ‚Äì at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, ‚Äúbut our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
474,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano‚Äôs 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier‚Äôs pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,‚Äù Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado‚Äôs Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

‚ÄúThis is some of the worst work in the world,‚Äù said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park‚Äôs rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement ‚Äì and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers‚Äô lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill‚Äôs toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel‚Äôs Landing in Utah‚Äôs Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

‚ÄúIf I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out ‚Ä¶ and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,‚Äù Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill‚Äôs toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren‚Äôt cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they‚Äôre not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag ‚Äì often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell ‚Äì or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah‚Äôs Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won‚Äôt degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

‚ÄúPeople are really opening up to the idea,‚Äù Henry said.

Plastic bags aren‚Äôt a perfect fix ‚Äì they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don‚Äôt want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don‚Äôt have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

‚ÄúOnce you get eight miles into the backcountry, it‚Äôs up to you to dig a hole,‚Äù Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
475,Cabaret's Joel Grey: 'Life is tough. But it's also beautiful',[],"‚ÄúShame on you! How could you bring that up? You wanna see a grown man cry?‚Äù Joel Grey is berating me on Zoom. All I wanted to know was how he got the nickname Mr Porno when filming his role as the Emcee, the smirking ringleader he created on Broadway in Kander and Ebb‚Äôs Weimar musical Cabaret. Mercifully, he is teasing me.

It‚Äôs not for the first time in our chat. There is a glint in his eye when he impersonates a ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy, breaks into a snippet of Sixteen Going on Seventeen from The Sound of Music (he once auditioned to play Rolf) and punctuates answers with a high-pitched exhalation that sounds like air escaping from a balloon. When he asks if I want to go to the Oscars I half-believe he‚Äôll take me. His party piece turns out to be an impression of Diana Ross, who handed him his statuette for best supporting actor for Cabaret at the Academy Awards in 1973. ‚ÄúListen to this,‚Äù he says, coming closer to the screen. ‚ÄúAnd the Oscar goes to,‚Äù he half-whispers in a breathy, suspenseful sigh. ‚ÄúJoel ‚Ä¶ Grey!‚Äù

Grey is 88 going on 18. In a pale pink shirt and clear frame glasses, he pops up not with the Emcee‚Äôs willkommen or bienvenue but a perky ‚ÄúHiya! How are ya?‚Äù He is in the office of his New York loft apartment, overlooking Hudson River park. The Oscar can be glimpsed in profile on the windowsill, alongside a Tony award for Cabaret. I‚Äôve already taken a virtual tour of his loft ‚Äì where his own photographs hang among artworks by Robert Rauschenberg and Duane Michals ‚Äì as it was featured in an interior design video online. I compliment him on his airy bathroom where a giant photograph of Machu Picchu hangs next to a monolithic tub. ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre not going in there today,‚Äù he replies briskly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good place for an interview.‚Äù

He has spent the morning making french toast and compiling a personal scrapbook of old pictures. It may be the next in his series of photography books, which have included a volume of vibrant closeup portraits of flowers. One of his lockdown hobbies is buying blooms at a nearby shop, then spending hours ‚Äúpulling them apart and looking deep inside‚Äù. He disappears to fetch a large print of purple petals and holds it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a face,‚Äù he says from behind the photograph. ‚ÄúA scary, beautiful thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs true: the flower resembles a glowing skull, somehow both richly flamboyant and ethereal. The picture remains held up, filling the screen. There is a silence. Do I talk to the flower? ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Grey chuckles from behind it.

With Broadway‚Äôs theatres closed by the pandemic, what has Grey been doing for entertainment? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at TikTok,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that? Everybody is doing it. My grandchild is doing it. And I don‚Äôt know what it is!‚Äù Has he been going out much? ‚ÄúLess and less. I live across the street from the river and there‚Äôs a beautiful park. When we go there, it‚Äôs jammed with people ‚Äì with masks mostly, but I get nervous.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot to fit into Grey‚Äôs scrapbook. He has been acting for almost 80 years. His professional debut, aged nine, was in his home town of Cleveland in On Borrowed Time, a macabre comedy about death. The experience ‚Äúgrabbed my throat and held me to the fire‚Äù, he remembers. ‚ÄúI knew I was an actor.‚Äù It resonated so strongly that he staged a revival of On Borrowed Time a few years ago and, this year, directed a Zoom reading of it. He has returned to Cabaret, too, reprising the Emcee on stage in the 80s. It will always be his most famous role, but there have been many others on Broadway: as the showman George M Cohan (in George M!, the closure of which was blamed on Richard Nixon visiting backstage); the Wizard of Oz in the hit Wicked; luckless ‚ÄúMr Cellophane‚Äù Amos Hart in Chicago, also from Kander and Ebb; and most recently, wistful servant Firs in The Cherry Orchard in 2016.

A year earlier, Grey made headlines when he came out in People magazine at the age of 82. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like labels,‚Äù he told his interviewer, ‚Äúbut if you have to put a label on it, I‚Äôm a gay man.‚Äù It had taken time, he said, to ‚Äúembrace that other part of who I always was‚Äù. In his 2016 memoir, Master of Ceremonies, he wrote about how, since his youth, he had felt forced to hide his sexuality. Grey detailed early relationships, including with a bellboy at the residential hotel where his family lived in an apartment, and described a permanent hyper-alertness about being ‚Äúsmall, sissy, Jewish‚Äù. It is frequently a painful read: his mother is disgusted when he comes out to her as a teenager by telling her about a threesome he had with a cantor from their temple. When he tells his wife, Jo Wilder, about his past gay experiences it deepens a void between them that ends their 24-year marriage in the early 80s. Their children are the actor Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing) and James, a chef. Grey describes how important it was for them both to see him play a gay man on stage, in Larry Kramer‚Äôs landmark Aids drama The Normal Heart, to better understand their father.

One of Grey‚Äôs first film roles (as a smirking law student in Come September in 1961) was opposite Rock Hudson, who was leading his own double life as a gay man in Hollywood. Grey remembers him as ‚Äúa really nice, funny guy‚Äù. When Hudson died of complications from Aids in 1985, it increased awareness of an epidemic that for many was ‚Äútoo horrible to accept or think through‚Äù, Grey says. Denial and misinformation were rife. One scene in The Normal Heart required him to kiss another man. ‚ÄúA friend of mine said, you ought to find out from a doctor whether or not you are putting yourself at risk,‚Äù remembers Grey. ‚ÄúI called this doctor who was taking care of Rock Hudson. He said: ‚ÄòDo you have to kiss the actor?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòYeah, it‚Äôs important in the script.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòThen I wouldn‚Äôt do the play.‚Äô‚Äù Grey wrestled with it and chose the play and the kiss. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI need to tell this story. As an actor it‚Äôs my job.‚Äô And it‚Äôs what I live for.‚Äù He remembers Kramer, who died this year, as a ‚Äútough audience‚Äù, but ‚Äúvery supportive of my work‚Äù.

It is theatre, rather than film or TV, that has been Grey‚Äôs passion since his childhood debut. Back then he was Joel Katz. His grandparents were eastern European Jews who settled in Cleveland. Joel was the first of two sons born to Mickey, a musician and comedian who found fame with his Jewish revue the Borscht Capades, and Grace, who named him after her favourite actor, Joel McCrea, and hungered for him to become famous.

A pair of contrasting scenes in Grey‚Äôs memoir find him alone as a boy. In one, his mother takes him to New York for an audition that never materialises, and leaves him scared in their hotel room when she goes out with a man. In the other, he is accidentally abandoned in the theatre after hours but is unafraid and revels in its backstage magic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want anybody to come and get me,‚Äù he tells me.

At nine, Grey craved a serious theatre career. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I cared about.‚Äù But after appearing in his dad‚Äôs revue, he became a nightclub performer and was spotted by the entertainer Eddie Cantor who gave him a spot on his TV show in 1951 when Grey was 18. His whirlwind routine is on YouTube: wide-eyed and elfin-featured, Grey cracks jokes, barks like a seal, does the charleston and dances like a dream. It‚Äôs a five-minute delight but the result, he says, was that ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get any parts in plays. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòOh no, he‚Äôs a TV guy‚Äô or ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a nightclub guy.‚Äô It kind of got in the way of my legitimacy.‚Äù His nightclub years included playing the London Palladium on a bill with Johnnie Ray, whose more fervent admirers threw Ray their underwear. ‚ÄúSometimes they forgot to clear the stage,‚Äù recalls Grey, who then had to dance a path between the knickers.

He was considering giving up acting when Cabaret came along. Where would he have gone? ‚ÄúAn art gallery,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúOr a hotdog stand.‚Äù The impish Emcee was the first theatre role he was offered without an audition. The songs may have been great but when he first read the script, he was alarmed that he had no dialogue and no direct involvement with the plot. The role was essentially a metaphor for seduction and corruption. ‚ÄúI was worried that it was one-dimensional, that he was a nightclub performer doing numbers.‚Äù That was precisely what Grey had been trying to escape. ‚ÄúI had to find out the psychology [of the Emcee] and who he was off stage so that hopefully I could bring that biography into those numbers.‚Äù

Six-year-old Jennifer would accompany him to the theatre, watching from the wings and even getting made up as one of the Kit Kat Girls in the seedy club. Elements of the Emcee‚Äôs look, notably the neatly combed hair and the bow tie, mirrored how Grey‚Äôs mother had dressed him as a child. Some of the makeup he used was his wife‚Äôs. His co-star Lotte Lenya ‚Äì celebrated chanteuse, ex-wife of Kurt Weill, and James Bond‚Äôs nemesis Rosa Klebb ‚Äì helped him with the German accent. Jill Haworth was Sally Bowles, the club dancer who longs for a gig at a respectable film studio ‚Äì surely a feeling Grey could relate to.

What made Cabaret so groundbreaking? ‚ÄúFirst of all, it was about a heinous and terrifying subject: the Holocaust. There were a lot of people who just wanted to forget about it. They tried to write it out of textbooks.‚Äù The musical‚Äôs unflinching account of antisemitism and persecution remains horribly current, much like Fiddler on the Roof, which Grey recently directed in a Yiddish version at New York‚Äôs Museum of Jewish Heritage. In the years immediately after the second world war, Mickey Katz had had hits with Yiddish parodies of popular songs (Haim Afen Range, for example, after Home on the Range). His father was, Grey wrote proudly in his memoir, ‚Äúinserting Jews into pop culture, so that we belonged, too‚Äù.

Grey says he and the producer-director, Hal Prince, were in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù creating Cabaret together on Broadway. But when Bob Fosse came to direct the film version he did not want to inherit Grey‚Äôs Emcee. ‚ÄúThere was a total standoff.‚Äù It was Fosse who called him Mr Porno, but Grey insists: ‚ÄúHe was the original Mr Porno! He was in burlesque backstage when he was a teenager. He saw all that bizarreness as a kid and was attracted to it.‚Äù Grey came to believe that Fosse‚Äôs animosity towards him was because he wanted to play the Emcee himself. ‚ÄúHe was an excellent performer,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúHe could have done it.‚Äù

At the Oscars, Grey beat three actors from The Godfather ‚Äì James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino ‚Äì and The Heartbreak Kid‚Äôs Eddie Albert. I imagine the Godfather mob glowering at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve forgiven me!‚Äù he laughs.

Cabaret matched its Tony awards tally of eight wins ‚Äì including best director for Fosse and best actress for Liza Minnelli. When Grey‚Äôs name was read out at the Oscars ceremony, there was Minnelli behind him, dressed in canary yellow, rocking wildly with delight. She was a great choice to play Bowles, he thinks, and her own irresistible sense of fun came with a vulnerability, too. Minnelli would fall asleep on his shoulder on the early morning taxi drives from the hotel to the set. The pair went on to launch a nightclub act in Vegas that they toured around the US. One night, she introduced him on stage before he was ready but he strolled on trouser-less regardless. They performed separately and together, with a set list including Cabaret songs.

Decades later, people are still quoting the Emcee to him. Is it an albatross in any way? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù He advances to the screen. ‚ÄúLet me come closer to you: just ‚Ä¶ great!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only boundary-breaking musical he has worked on. Grey has a small but joyous scene in Lars von Trier‚Äôs Dancer in the Dark, tap-dancing in a courtroom with Bj√∂rk. That looked like fun, I suggest. ‚ÄúWrong,‚Äù he barks back. ‚ÄúHard! The two of them [Bj√∂rk and Von Trier] were not connecting. [We] were in the midst of doing something very unique, and the star and the director weren‚Äôt talking.‚Äù

We‚Äôve rambled way beyond our allotted time and Grey has his scrapbook and his art to attend to. But he starts another story about visiting Cleveland‚Äôs art museum as a kid, finding rooms to hide in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be in the Egyptian place getting into one of those sarcophaguses. I had this idea that I could hide in one of them.‚Äù His high-pitch exhale comes back, this time turning into a full ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù I wonder what he would say to nine-year-old Joel Katz, messing around in museums and embarking on his first stage role back in Cleveland. He replies: ‚ÄúStick with it, be who you are. It‚Äôs going to be tough.‚Äù There‚Äôs a beat. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also going to be beautiful.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

487,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire ‚Äì photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria‚Äôs 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: ‚ÄúWalking through the remains of Europe‚Äôs biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.‚Äù

A Valentine‚Äôs Day mug. Valentine‚Äôs Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

‚ÄúBetween the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone‚Äôs home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.‚Äù

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

‚ÄúThe owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.‚Äù

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

‚ÄúThis is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.‚Äù

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child‚Äôs shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

492,Tier 2 lockdown rules in England: the latest Covid restrictions explained,[],"The new system came into force in England on 2 December, replacing the national lockdown

England‚Äôs new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The ‚Äúrule of six‚Äù will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm ‚Äì with last orders at 10pm ‚Äì only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas ‚Äì from 23 December to 27 December ‚Äì there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

493,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London‚Äôs Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: ‚ÄúWithout the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

‚ÄúPolice took a measured response. You, however, didn‚Äôt engage with police ‚Äì police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.‚Äù

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge ‚Äì meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment ‚Äì after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park‚Äôs Speakers‚Äô Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by ‚Äúaddressing the gathering and encouraging ‚Ä¶ others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,‚Äù the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a ‚Äúlight-touch policing‚Äù approach by encouraging the gatherings to ‚Äúdisperse without the necessity for enforcement action‚Äù.

But Corbyn, he added, had ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù participated in the gathering ‚Äúby way of making public addresses‚Äù and that he allegedly ‚Äúdisregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period‚Äù.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 ‚Äúis not a pandemic‚Äù and argue that ‚Äúif it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us‚Äù.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: ‚ÄúThis case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers‚Äô Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

‚ÄúMr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.‚Äù

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A ‚Äúblanket ban‚Äù on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a tremendous result.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
494,'It's lovely to be back': on the streets of three-tier England as lockdown lifts,[],"England‚Äôs second national lockdown lifted on Wednesday, with 99% of the population placed under the second and third tiers of a three-tier regime. However, non-essential shops are allowed to open under every tier, giving shop owners hope for a much-needed high street boost ahead of Christmas. The Guardian went out on Wednesday to take the mood across the different zones.

Tier 1: St Ives

The Three Ferrets pub in the Cornish harbour-side town of St Ives was buzzing with chatter and laughter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lovely to be back,‚Äù said Richard Cockling, 83, a retired merchant seaman and fisherman as he sipped on a celebratory gin and tonic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed this place. The latest lockdown has been the worst ‚Äì long and boring. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back into this place.‚Äù

Keith Tickner, 59, a cleaner, settled down in his usual cosy spot in front of the blazing fire with a group of friends. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how much you miss your mates and your routine until you‚Äôre allowed back,‚Äù he said.

St Ives, a long-beloved retreat for artists, beach lovers and surfers, was recently judged the happiest place to live in the UK. On the day it and the rest of Cornwall became the only area in mainland England to begin life in tier 1 it felt a jolly town to be in.

From first light, the town was packed with delivery lorries restocking the shops, cafes and restaurants. Bleary-eyed kitchen staff emerged from furlough to begin prepping for dinner time while shopkeepers polished windows and scrubbed floors.

‚ÄúLook at that cobweb,‚Äù said Paul Clegg, a potter who specialises in lucky Cornish piskies, his take on the leprechaun, as he buffed his windows. ‚ÄúThis is the best place in the country anyway. So many people who live here came on holiday, then just decided to stay because it‚Äôs so nice. But it does feel a particularly good day today.‚Äù

Opposite, Sarah Allen was putting up Christmas lights outside her cafe, Sky‚Äôs Diner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù She expected to be busy. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get visitors coming from all over the country who want a taste of life in tier 1,‚Äù she said.

Cornwall council‚Äôs leader, Julian German, called it a ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù for the county but asked people not to drop their guard. ‚ÄúCovid doesn‚Äôt care what tier we‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòWe live in a bit of a bubble here‚Äô: Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor shop. Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian

The advantages of living in tier 1 include being allowed to have a drink in a pub without a meal and to meet in a group of up to six indoors as well as outside.

People from tier 3 areas have been urged by the council not to visit Cornwall and the police this week revealed that up to 10 extra cars would be patrolling Devon and Cornwall to deal with Covid rule-breakers.

The council said people from tier 2 areas should bring the restrictions they are subject to at home with them ‚Äúlike hand luggage‚Äù. For example, those in tier 2, should have a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù with their pub drink.

Of course, enforcing such rules are difficult. The Pilchard Press, a real ale pub tucked up an alley near the harbour, was taking no chances. It had fixed a notice to its railings reading: ‚ÄúCornwall residents only‚Äù.

At the Golden Lion pub, licensee Matt Squires said he would be politely asking people where they are from if he did not recognise them. ‚ÄúWe plan to keep people from different tiers separate,‚Äù he said. Locals will be able to use the front bar looking on to the street, visitors the back bar.

Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor clothes shop, said that tier 1 living would not change much for many people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the shops but actually we live in a bit of a bubble here, close to nature and the water. It‚Äôs why people like it.‚Äù SM

Tier 2: Liverpool

‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt seem as scared to come out‚Äô: Rob Pritchard, manager at vintage clothes shop Resurrection in Liverpool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

Vans lined up outside the independent shops and restaurants on Liverpool‚Äôs Bold Street in the morning drizzle to deliver stock to eager staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling festive, we‚Äôve got our Christmas music on and our twinkly lights on,‚Äù said Nicki Whatling, a manager at Rennie‚Äôs Arts and Crafts, as picture frames were unloaded into the store.

While the shop has only 23 days to make up the bulk of lost sales over lockdown, she said she was hopeful the business could ‚Äúhave a fairly decent December‚Äù.

As the day wore on, Whatling‚Äôs wishes began to look more likely, with throngs of Christmas shoppers trickling up and down the city‚Äôs streets. At the vintage clothes store Resurrection, where students were sifting through leisurewear and parents were picking out gifts, the director Rob Pritchard said there had ‚Äúbeen a buzz about the place‚Äù in the middle of the day.

Usually, he said, the store would be much quieter in early December after the Black Friday sales weekend, but he predicted the store would continue to be busy throughout this month. ‚ÄúA lot of people are saying they‚Äôre taking the chance to get back into the city again. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that today,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhen we ended the last lockdown some people were still too scared to come out. This time maybe because the infection rates have fallen so much in Liverpool, they don‚Äôt seem as scared to come.‚Äù

Meanwhile, at the pizza restaurant Crust, the manager Antonio Fornaro was grateful the venue had been able to open ahead of Christmas. ‚ÄúWhen they announced it, I had calls from all my colleagues saying, ‚ÄòYes! We‚Äôre going to be able to open‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Throughout England‚Äôs second national lockdown, takeaway sales had dropped off as people reigned in spending, said Fornaro. But on Wednesday afternoon, the reduced tables and chairs in the restaurant were full once again.

Outside the trainer store Size?, university student Adam Macholc, 18, was one of a small socially distanced group of sneakerheads waiting for the latest Adidas drop as staff inside got ready to open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying them for myself,‚Äù he said, adding that despite a turbulent first term, ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a bit more hope‚Äù after the news that the UK had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

In Liverpool‚Äôs main commercial shopping district, around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, other shoppers seemed to be feeling confident too. A queue snaked around the city‚Äôs Primark store, while shoppers trickled in and out of Debenhams to pick up a bargain.

Willing some of them to stop for a substantial meal and a drink on their way home, was the manager of the Doctor Duncan‚Äôs pub, Amy McCarthy. Under tier 2 regulations, a key difference with tier 1 is alcohol cannot be served without food and there must be no multiple household mixing in venues like Doctor Duncan‚Äôs. The pub, located away from the main shopping centre next to Liverpool Lime Street station, had a quiet day with only a handful of customers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next to the bus stops where people usually head to football games and are known for being the first and the last stop. So it‚Äôs different territory for us having to emphasise our pub grub,‚Äù she said. AW

Tier 3: Nottingham

After a month cooped up indoors, shoppers in Nottingham seized the opportunity to return to the city centre on Wednesday.

The east Midlands city is back in tier 3, and is therefore subject to England‚Äôs toughest coronavirus restrictions. Shops, hair salons and gyms have been allowed to reopen, but hospitality venues must offer takeaway or delivery only.

In the city centre, stallholders were preparing for this weekend‚Äôs opening of the Christmas market on Old Market Square, in the heart of the city.

The prime location is overlooked by an imposing six-storey stone building which houses the department store Debenhams, and on the other side of the square is a Dorothy Perkins and a Burton ‚Äì brands that are part of Philip Green‚Äôs Arcadia empire. Both Debenhams and Arcadia are living on borrowed time, having collapsed into administration on consecutive days this week

If Arcadia‚Äôs brands do not find a buyer, Nottingham will feel the impact of store closures keenly. The city is home to nine Arcadia stores ‚Äì .

Tallulah Harries-Pugh, 29, was holding a Topshop carrier bag, but with an item to return rather than a new purchase.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with Sir Philip Green‚Äôs ethics, and I try not to shop [at Arcadia brands],‚Äù said Tallulah. But she said she was worried about the staff, and what more store closures would mean for the high street.

The scars of another recent retail collapse are clearly visible in Nottingham city centre. One of the city‚Äôs two shopping centres, Broadmarsh, was half-demolished with plans under way for a multimillion pound redevelopment, when its owner, the retail property company Intu, collapsed in June.

The city council has been handed the keys to the development and has already spent ¬£19m on the project. Councillor Sam Webster, whose ward covers the city centre, concedes it won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. The project is probably the biggest regeneration in a core city in the country‚Äù.

In the short-term, however, Nottingham‚Äôs businesses have to contend with tier 3 restrictions.

Prof David Paton from Nottingham University business school warns that retailers will feel the impact of cafe, pub and restaurant closures. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of interlinkage between high street hospitality and shops. Nottingham is going to face that, as all tier 3 will.‚Äù

In a normal year the nine stainless steel fermenting vessels at the Castle Rock brewery near the city‚Äôs train station would be full, ahead of the expected peak in demand during the festive season. This December they are empty.

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas,‚Äù said the managing director, Colin Wilde. The brewer and pub operator has 22 sites in Nottingham and across the east Midlands, all in tier 3.

The company now offers takeaway alcohol from its brewery and pubs, but it brings in less than 10% of normal trade, and Wilde said the closed pubs ‚Äúleak cash‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a sector, we feel like canaries in a cage. It feels like politicians are testing things out on the hospitality sector and don‚Äôt think it matters if it dies.‚Äù JP",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
495,No 10 and regulator contradict Hancock's 'because of Brexit' Covid vaccine claim,[],"Both Downing Street and the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator have contradicted a claim by Matt Hancock that Brexit helped the UK become the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus.

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK‚Äôs decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. ‚ÄúWe have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,‚Äù said June Raine, the MHRA‚Äôs chief executive.

Timeline UK Covid-19 restrictions: the key political dates ahead Show Hide Here are some of the key dates ahead for the UK's Covid-19 restrictions. The current lockdown in England ends, and the new strengthened tier system comes into force with nearly 99% of England headed for the strictest two tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day ‚Äì decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs‚Äô approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock‚Äôs stated view, Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

‚ÄúI think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,‚Äù he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it‚Äôs obviously incredibly positive news.‚Äù

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat job of working with the company to look at that data as it‚Äôs come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would‚Äù.

Hancock continued: ‚ÄúThe second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

‚ÄúWe do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they‚Äôre done because of Brexit.‚Äù

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing ‚Äúfast and loose with the facts‚Äù over the vaccine. The party‚Äôs health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim ‚Äúis not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look‚Äù.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock‚Äôs department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA‚Äôs ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as ‚Äúpart of wider conversations‚Äù about the MHRA‚Äôs lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA‚Äôs role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
496,The Scott Trust: values and history,[],"The Scott Trust: values and history

The Trust forms part of a unique ownership structure for the Guardian that ensures editorial interests remain free of commercial pressures

The Scott Trust: a unique form of global media ownership

The Scott Trust was originally created in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Guardian free from commercial or political interference.

The Trust was reconstituted in 1948 and 2008 it was replaced with The Scott Trust Limited, a limited company with the same protections for the Guardian enshrined in its constitution. The Scott Trust is the sole shareholder in Guardian Media Group and its profits are reinvested in journalism and do not benefit a proprietor or shareholders.

The formation of The Scott Trust

The Manchester Guardian was founded in 1821 to promote the liberal interest in the aftermath of the Peterloo massacre. The newspaper gained an international reputation under long-serving editor and owner CP Scott.

When CP Scott retired from managing and editing the paper in July 1929, he passed control to his two sons. John was manager and Edward (Ted) took over as editor.

The death of CP Scott and son Ted within three months of each other in 1932 brought a very real threat to the future independence of the Guardian.

The Inland Revenue would claim full death duties, or inheritance tax, in the event of John‚Äôs death and would mean the end of the Manchester Guardian as an independent liberal newspaper.

To prevent this, John renounced all financial benefit in the business for himself and his family by transferring all the ordinary shares in the company ‚Äì a stake worth more than ¬£1 million at the time ‚Äì to a group of trustees. The Scott Trust became the owner of the Manchester Guardian.

The Trust Deed of June 19, 1936 echoed the long-standing injunction to those who take up responsibility for the paper. It stated that the company must ‚Äòbe carried on as nearly as may be upon the same principles as they have heretofore been conducted‚Äô. This remains the sole instruction given to the incoming Guardian editor by the Trust.

The core purpose of The Scott Trust is:

to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity: as a quality national newspaper without party affiliation; remaining faithful to its liberal tradition; as a profit-seeking enterprise managed in an efficient and cost-effective manner

all other activities should be consistent with the central objective. The Company which the Trust owns should: be managed to ensure profits are available to further the central objective; not invest in activities which conflict with the values and principles of the Trust

the values and principles of the Trust should be upheld throughout the Group. The Trust declares a subsidiary interest in promoting the causes of freedom in the press and liberal journalism, both in Britain and elsewhere.

The values of The Scott Trust

The Manchester Guardian was founded in the liberal interest to support reform in the early 19th century. The ethos of public service has been part of the DNA of the newspaper and Group ever since.

CP Scott, the famous Manchester Guardian editor, outlined the paper‚Äôs principles in his celebrated centenary leader on May 5, 1921.

The much-quoted article is still used to explain the values of the present-day newspaper, Trust and Group. It is also recognised around the world as the ultimate statement of values for a free press.

Among the many well known lines are the assertions that ‚ÄòComment is free, but facts are sacred‚Äô, that newspapers have ‚Äòa moral as well as a material existence‚Äô and that ‚Äòthe voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard‚Äô. The values he described are: honesty; cleanness (today interpreted as integrity); courage; fairness; and a sense of duty to the reader and the community.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
497,Katharine Viner: 'The Guardian's reader funding model is working. It's inspiring',[],"Three and a half years ago, when I took over as editor-in-chief, we were faced with the urgent challenge of how to make the Guardian sustainable.

The situation looked bleak across the media. Print advertising was in steep decline, and digital advertising growth was going almost entirely to Google and Facebook. News organisations everywhere were searching for answers to the challenge that they were being read more than ever before, but with fewer ways to cover costs. Month by month, more and more news outlets went behind a paywall.

We realised we had to find a new way to fund Guardian journalism. The obvious answer was to go to you, our readers ‚Äì at that time we had 150 million, and you have always had a special relationship with the Guardian, valuing our editorial independence, our commitment to investigative reporting, and our progressive viewpoint rooted in the facts.

We knew we wanted all of our journalism to remain global, free and accessible for our readers ‚Äì and not restrict it only to those who could afford to pay for it. We wanted to give people the opportunity to contribute financially, in ways that worked for them, meaning that we could provide our readers ‚Äì regardless of where they live, how much they earn or how they like to get their news ‚Äì a way to support us that also tied in deeply with the liberal and progressive ethos on which the Guardian was founded.

When we asked for your support, we weren‚Äôt sure whether it would work. Both friends and competitors were deeply sceptical for a long time, but you, our readers listened and responded. It was inspiring how many of you from more than 180 countries wanted to play a role in supporting the Guardian financially.

This support has meant so much, and helps protect our editorial independence, allowing our journalists the freedom to report and investigate important stories of our time.

Your support enables us to hold technology companies to account by exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Without you, it would be much harder to do this.

It is your support that means we can focus on the unfolding climate crisis impacting communities and the living planet, and commit to reporting on the environment: from the threat to public lands in the US to the drought in Australia.

Guardian readers‚Äô support also means we can fight for justice for the Windrush generation in the UK, and hold the home secretary to account for the hostile environment policy.

To be able to announce today that we have received financial support from more than 1 million readers around the world in the last three years is such a significant step. This model of being funded by our readers through voluntary contributions, subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly, membership or as part of our patrons programme is working.

This means that within just three years, the Guardian is on a path to being sustainable. We hope to break even by April 2019. It has not been easy and we still have a long way to go ‚Äì we need you to continue to support us financially, and we need more of our readers to take that step if they can. We continue to face financial challenges, but we are determined to find new ways to make meaningful journalism thrive ‚Äì and with your help it will.

We are living in dangerous times when dark ideologies flourish, and it‚Äôs no surprise that people feel anxious and confused. I know it can sometimes be tempting to turn away from news coverage. But I‚Äôm sure you feel, as I do, that we have to understand the world if we‚Äôre going to have a chance of making it better for everyone.

That is what Guardian journalism is trying to do: to give you the facts so that, through clarity, we can make sense of what is happening; and to inspire you, through ideas and imagination, to find an alternative. Thank you to those who have supported us financially so far. We hope that today many more of you will consider offering us one-off or ongoing support, with a contribution or a subscription. Together, through clarity and imagination, we can make space for hope.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
498,History of the Guardian and the Observer,[],"The Manchester Guardian was founded by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor in the wake of the Peterloo massacre of 1819. The first edition appeared on 5 May 1821. Taylor‚Äôs nephew CP Scott went on to become editor in 1872 and bought the paper in 1907. His 57 year editorship cemented the paper‚Äôs liberal values and gave it an international reputation. In 1919 it began publishing a special edition for readers abroad in the form of the Guardian Weekly.

CP Scott‚Äôs son John Russell Scott was determined to protect this legacy when, after the deaths of his father and brother, he became the paper‚Äôs owner. He established the Scott Trust in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity. The newspaper continued to flourish under the Trust and, in 1959, changed its masthead to simply The Guardian, to reflect the breadth of its readership and coverage. The editor‚Äôs office and major editorial departments then moved to London in 1964.

In 1993 the Guardian Media Group acquired the Observer, the world‚Äôs oldest Sunday newspaper, as a sister paper for the Guardian. Two years later the Guardian introduced its first website and in 1999 the series of sites that followed were pulled together to form Guardian Unlimited, predecessor to today‚Äôs theguardian.com.

499,A mission for journalism in a time of crisis,[],"‚ÄòNo former period, in the history of our Country, has been marked by the agitation of questions of a more important character than those which are now claiming the attention of the public.‚Äù So began the announcement, nearly 200 years ago, of a brand-new newspaper to be published in Manchester, England, which proclaimed that ‚Äúthe spirited discussion of political questions‚Äù and ‚Äúthe accurate detail of facts‚Äù were ‚Äúparticularly important at this juncture‚Äù.

Now we are living through another extraordinary period in history: one defined by dazzling political shocks and the disruptive impact of new technologies in every part of our lives. The public sphere has changed more radically in the past two decades than in the previous two centuries ‚Äì and news organisations, including this one, have worked hard to adjust.

A mission for journalism in a time of crisis ‚Äì podcast Read more

But the turbulence of our time may demand that we do more than adapt. The circumstances in which we report, produce, distribute and obtain the news have changed so dramatically that this moment requires nothing less than a serious consideration of what we do and why we do it.

The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, stated a very clear purpose when it was established in 1936: ‚Äúto secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Guardian free from commercial or political interference.‚Äù As an editor, it‚Äôs hard to imagine a finer mission for a proprietor: our sole shareholder is committed only to our journalistic freedom and longterm survival.

But if the mission of the Scott Trust is to ensure that Guardian journalism will exist for ever, it is still left to us to define what the mission of that journalism will be. What is the meaning and purpose of our work? What role do we play in society?

After working at the Guardian for two decades, I feel I know instinctively why it exists. Most of our journalists and our readers do, too ‚Äì it‚Äôs something to do with holding power to account, and upholding liberal values. We know what defines a Guardian story, what feels like a Guardian perspective, what makes something ‚Äúvery Guardian‚Äù (for better and for worse).

In my own work as editor of the Guardian in Australia, and then as the editor of the Guardian in the US, I tried to conceptualise the Guardian with a different accent ‚Äì to identify the essential qualities of Guardian journalism and bring them to new audiences. Now, as the editor-in-chief of the Guardian and the Observer, I believe our time requires something deeper. It is more urgent than ever to ask: who are we, fundamentally?

The answer to this question is in our past, our present and our future. I want to lead a Guardian that relates to the world in a way that reflects our history, engages deeply with this disorientating global moment, and is sustainable for ever.

The history of the Guardian begins on 16 August 1819, when John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist, attended an enormous demonstration for parliamentary reform in Manchester. In St Peter‚Äôs Field, a popular radical speaker, Henry Hunt, addressed a crowd estimated to contain 60,000 people ‚Äì more than half the population of the Manchester area at the time, dressed in their Sunday best and packed in so tightly that their hats were said to be touching.

At the time, the mood in the country was insurrectionary. The French revolution, three decades earlier, had spread throughout the world the seismic idea that ordinary people could face down the powerful and win ‚Äì a revelation for the masses and a fright for those in power. After Britain‚Äôs victory at Waterloo and the end of the Napoleonic wars, the country was mired in economic depression and high unemployment, while the Corn Laws, which kept the price of grain artificially high, brought mass hunger. There were protests and riots throughout the country, from handloom weavers trashing newly invented factory machinery to anti-slavery campaigners boycotting sugar.

There was also a growing campaign for the vote: the big, densely populated city of Manchester had no member of parliament ‚Äì while Old Sarum, a prosperous hamlet in southern England, with just one voter, had two MPs to represent him. The city‚Äôs businessmen were demanding an overhaul of this rotten system ‚Äì and working men (and, for the first time, women) wanted their own chance to vote.

The combination of economic depression, political repression and the politicisation of workers with economic need was combustible. As the essayist William Hazlitt wrote one year earlier, ‚Äúnothing that was established was to be tolerated ‚Ä¶ the world was to be turned topsy-turvy.‚Äù

As most of Manchester gathered in St Peter‚Äôs Field on 16 August, the city‚Äôs magistrates, intimidated by the size of the crowd and their demands, ordered armed cavalry to charge into the crowd ‚Äì to break up the meeting and arrest Hunt and other speakers on the podium. The troops stormed through the people, hacking with their sabres and ‚Äúcutting at everyone they could reach‚Äù. Eleven people were killed on the day, seven men and four women, and many hundreds were injured. It became known as the Peterloo massacre or the Battle of Peterloo, and its impact was huge: the historian AJP Taylor said that Peterloo ‚Äúbegan the breakup of the old order in England‚Äù.

John Edward Taylor was in the crowd that day, reporting for a weekly paper, the Manchester Gazette. When a reporter for the daily Times of London was arrested, Taylor was concerned that the people of the capital might not get an accurate report of the massacre ‚Äì he correctly feared that without the account of a journalist on the scene, Londoners would instead get only the official version of events, which would protect the magistrates who had caused the bloodshed.

So Taylor rushed a report on to the night coach to London, got it into the Times, and thus turned a Manchester demonstration into a national scandal. Taylor exposed the facts, without hysteria. By reporting what he had witnessed, he told the stories of the powerless, and held the powerful to account.

But Taylor did not stop there. After the massacre, he spent months reporting on the fate of the wounded, documenting the injuries of more than 400 survivors.

Quick guide What was the Peterloo massacre? Show Hide What was the Peterloo Massacre and how many were killed? On 16 August 1819, up to 60,000 working class people from the towns and villages of what is now Greater Manchester marched to St Peters Fields in central Manchester to demand political representation. Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman ‚Äì a private militia paid for by rich locals ‚Äì to storm the crowd with sabres. Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre ‚Äì 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death. Why is it called Peterloo? The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city‚Äôs first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was ‚Äúa bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.‚Äù What did the protesters want? They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation‚Äôs finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor. At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means. Why is Peterloo important? It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù media sought to discredit the protesters. Helen Pidd, North of England editor Photograph: Rischgitz/Hulton Archive

Taylor‚Äôs relentless effort to tell the full story of Peterloo strengthened his own reformist political views ‚Äì and he became determined to agitate for fair representation in parliament. He decided to start his own newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, with the financial backing of other middle-class radicals (10 put up ¬£100 each, and an 11th contributed ¬£50). The first edition was published on 5 May 1821, devoted to enlightenment values, liberty, reform and justice. It was launched with great confidence and optimism, by a man who believed that, ‚Äúin spite of Peterloo and police spies, reason was great and would prevail‚Äù.

The Manchester Guardian was founded in a mood of great hope, and faith in ordinary people. The manifesto that Taylor produced before the paper‚Äôs launch speaks powerfully of the ‚Äúgreat diffusion of Education‚Äù that was taking place, and ‚Äúthe greatly increased interest which political subjects excite, and the immense extension of the circle within which they are discussed. It is of the utmost importance that this increased interest should be turned to beneficial account‚Äù.

It is a powerful document, and one whose ideals still shape the Guardian ‚Äì a celebration of more people getting educated, of more people engaging in politics, from different walks of life, from poorer communities. And it is a document that articulates a sense of responsibility to the public ‚Äì that the Manchester Guardian could engage with the people who were starting to become involved in politics, giving them the information they need to take action. It is a wholly uncynical and unsnobbish document. It is on people‚Äôs side.

In the decades following Taylor‚Äôs death in 1844, the Manchester Guardian began to drift from the political ideals that had inspired its founding. It was highly profitable, but in becoming so it got too close to the Manchester cotton merchants who paid for the advertising that supported the paper. It even sided with the slave-owning south in the American civil war: the paper demanded that the Manchester cotton workers who starved in the streets because they refused to touch cotton picked by American slaves should be forced back into work. (Abraham Lincoln wrote to the ‚Äúworking men of Manchester‚Äù in 1863 to thank them for their ‚Äúsublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country‚Äù.)

This period of complacency for the Guardian was dramatically ended by the appointment as editor of CP Scott, who transformed the paper and helped establish the political commitments that have been so important to its identity ever since.

Scott was made editor in 1872, at the age of 25. He was a radical Liberal and party activist who cared greatly about social justice and pacifism. Scott faced two big ideological challenges during the 57 years of his editorship; and his response to both helped form the Guardian as it is today.

The first was the question of Irish Home Rule: on the most contentious issue of the time, which split the Liberal party in the 1880s, Scott campaigned for self-government in Ireland ‚Äì marking the moment, according to the historian David Ayerst, when the Guardian most clearly became ‚Äúa paper of the Left‚Äù. At the end of the 19th century, Scott took the Guardian to an even more controversial anti-colonial position. During the second Boer war, from 1899 to 1902, Britain was rampantly jingoistic; anyone who opposed the war was cast as a traitor. The Guardian stood against it and ran a campaign for peace, while the brilliant Guardian reporter Emily Hobhouse exposed the concentration camps for the Boers run by the British.

The paper‚Äôs stance was so controversial that it lost advertisers and one-seventh of its sales. One rival paper, confident that the Guardian was on the verge of collapse, sent a brass band to stand outside our offices in Cross Street, Manchester to play Handel‚Äôs mournful Dead March from Saul.

Scott‚Äôs courageous position nearly did kill the Guardian. But in standing up to the prevailing political mood of the day, Scott turned the newspaper into ‚Äúthe dominant expression of radical thinking among educated men and women‚Äù, as Ayerst wrote. ‚ÄúClearly this was a paper that could not be bought.‚Äù

As Scott orientated the paper towards a more radical position ‚Äì away from laissez-faire liberalism to what was known as ‚ÄúNew Liberalism‚Äù, concerned with social justice and welfare ‚Äì he set the Guardian on the progressive path it has maintained, with a few missteps, ever since.

One of those missteps came in 1948. Surprising as it may seem today, the Manchester Guardian disparaged the foundation of Britain‚Äôs National Health Service. While supporting the changes as a ‚Äúgreat step forward‚Äù, the Guardian feared that the state providing welfare ‚Äúrisks an increase in the proportion of the less gifted‚Äù. Three years later, the paper went further and backed the Conservatives at the 1951 general election. (Historians believe that these decisions came about because the editor at the time, AP Wadsworth, loathed Nye Bevan, the passionate Labour politician behind the welfare state.)

Making sense of a political moment when you‚Äôre in the midst of it is difficult ‚Äì even if you avoid commercial and personal conflicts, it can still be hard to see it and understand it. A news organisation might often get things wrong ‚Äì it needs some core values and principles to stick to in order to try to get it right.

William Percival Crozier is appointed as editor. 1936 Ownership of the Manchester Guardian is transferred to the Scott Trust to protect the paper, its independence and the journalistic principles of CP Scott. ‚Äã1944 Following WP Crozier‚Äôs death, Alfred Powell Wadsworth becomes editor. ‚Äã1956 Alastair Hetherington becomes editor following Wadsworth‚Äôs death. 1959 On 24 August the newspaper changes its title from the Manchester Guardian to the Guardian, to reflect the growing importance of national and international affairs in the newspaper. 1964 The editor‚Äôs office and major editorial departments relocate from Manchester to London. ‚Äã1975 Peter Preston is appointed editor.‚Äã 1988 The Guardian has a radical redesign, splitting the newspaper into two sections and introducing a new masthead. 1995 Alan Rusbridger becomes editor. 1999 Guardian Unlimited (GU) network of websites is launched. 2005 The mid-sized Berliner format newspaper launched. It is the UK's first full-colour national newspaper. 2011 A new digital operation, Guardian US, is launched in New York as a hub for Guardian readers in the US. 2013 The Guardian launches Australian digital edition, Guardian Australia. 2015 Katharine Viner is appointed Guardian editor-in-chief. 2018 The Guardian and Observer newspapers launch in a new tabloid format and the website and apps are given a redesign. - Photograph: The Guardian

Many of these core values were laid out by Scott on the 100th birthday of the Guardian, with his justly celebrated centenary essay of 1921. It was here that Scott introduced the famous phrase ‚Äúcomment is free, but facts are sacred‚Äù, and decreed that ‚Äúthe voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard‚Äù. It was here that he laid out the values of the Guardian: honesty, cleanness [integrity], courage, fairness, a sense of duty to the reader and a sense of duty to the community.

CP Scott‚Äôs essay, like John Edward Taylor‚Äôs foundational prospectus, is both powerful and hopeful; as Scott writes, ‚Äúthe newspaper has a moral as well as a material existence‚Äù.

Our moral conviction, as exemplified by Taylor and codified by Scott, rests on a faith that people long to understand the world they‚Äôre in, and to create a better one. We believe in the value of the public sphere; that there is such a thing as the public interest, and the common good; that we are all of equal worth; that the world should be free and fair.

These inspiring ideas have always been at the heart of the Guardian at its best ‚Äì whether the paper is called the Manchester Guardian or the Guardian, the name it adopted in 1959 ‚Äì and they are enshrined in our independent ownership structure, in which the Guardian is owned solely by the Scott Trust. Any money made must be spent on journalism. (The Observer, of course, has its own distinct and honourable history and perspective ‚Äì and as part of the same company, we are close siblings, but not twins.)

This is the mission that has motivated so many of the great moments in Guardian history, from our independent reporting of the Spanish civil war to the dramatic Edward Snowden revelations; from taking an anti-colonial position in the Suez crisis to standing up to Rupert Murdoch, the police and politicians in the phone-hacking scandal; from sending Jonathan Aitken to jail to the Panama and Paradise Papers.

These values, beliefs and ideas are well-established and enduring. They do not, by themselves, tell us how to meet the moral urgency of this new era. The world we knew has been pulled out of shape, and we must ask what it means to uphold these values now ‚Äì as journalists and as citizens ‚Äì and how they will inform our journalism and purpose.

Almost 200 years have passed since the public meeting that sparked Peterloo. But the past three decades ‚Äì since the invention of the world wide web in 1989 ‚Äì have transformed our idea of the public in ways that John Edward Taylor and CP Scott could not have imagined.

This technological revolution was exciting and inspiring. After 600 years of the Gutenberg era, when mass communication was dominated by established and hierarchical sources of information, the web felt like a breath of fresh air: open, creative, egalitarian. As its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, put it, ‚Äúthis is for everyone‚Äù. At first, it felt like the beginning of a thrilling new era of hyper-connectivity, with all the world‚Äôs knowledge at our fingertips and every person empowered to participate ‚Äì as if the internet was one big town square where all our problems could be solved and everyone helped each other.

While many news organisations saw the internet as a threat to the old hierarchies of authority, forward-looking editors like Alan Rusbridger, who led the Guardian from 1995 until 2015, embraced this hopeful new future for journalism, by investing in digital expansion ‚Äì hiring engineers and product managers ‚Äì and by understanding that journalists, in this new world, must be open to challenge and debate from their audience. From making the Guardian the first British news organisation to employ a readers‚Äô editor to launching an opinion site that inverted the traditional model of top-down newspaper commentary, he put the Guardian at the forefront of digital innovation and the changed relationships of this new era. As I wrote four years ago in my essay The Rise of the Reader, the open web created genuinely new possibilities for journalism ‚Äì and journalists who resisted the technological revolution would damage both their own interests and the interests of good journalism.

But it has become clear that the utopian mood of the early 2000s did not anticipate all that technology would enable. Our digital town squares have become mobbed with bullies, misogynists and racists, who have brought a new kind of hysteria to public debate. Our movements and feelings are constantly monitored, because surveillance is the business model of the digital age. Facebook has become the richest and most powerful publisher in history by replacing editors with algorithms ‚Äì shattering the public square into millions of personalised news feeds, shifting entire societies away from the open terrain of genuine debate and argument, while they make billions from our valued attention.

This shift presents big challenges for liberal democracy. But it presents particular problems for journalism.

The transition from print to digital did not initially change the basic business model for many news organisations ‚Äì that is, selling advertisements to fund the journalism delivered to readers. For a time, it seemed that the potentially vast scale of an online audience might compensate for the decline in print readers and advertisers. But this business model is currently collapsing, as Facebook and Google swallow digital advertising; as a result, the digital journalism produced by many news organisations has become less and less meaningful.

Publishers that are funded by algorithmic ads are locked in a race to the bottom in pursuit of any audience they can find ‚Äì desperately binge-publishing without checking facts, pushing out the most shrill and most extreme stories to boost clicks. But even this huge scale can no longer secure enough revenue.

On some sites, journalists who learned in training that ‚Äúnews is something that someone, somewhere doesn‚Äôt want published‚Äù churn out 10 commodified stories a day without making a phone call. ‚ÄúWhere once we had propaganda, press releases, journalism, and advertising,‚Äù the academic Emily Bell has written, ‚Äúwe now have ‚Äòcontent‚Äô.‚Äù Readers are overwhelmed: bewildered by the quantity of ‚Äúnews‚Äù they see every day, nagged by intrusive pop-up ads, confused by what is real and what is fake, and confronted with an experience that is neither useful nor enjoyable.

How technology disrupted the truth | Katharine Viner Read more

Many people get most of their news from Facebook, which means that information arrives in one big stream ‚Äì which may contain fact-based independent journalism from transparent sources alongside invented stories from a click farm, or content funded by malevolent actors to influence an election. The Richmond Standard, a website in California‚Äôs Bay Area, describes itself as a ‚Äúcommunity-driven daily news source‚Äù. If you see one of its headlines in your news feed, you couldn‚Äôt possibly know that it is owned by the multinational oil giant Chevron ‚Äì which, according to the Financial Times, also owns ‚Äúthe Richmond refinery that in August 2012 caught fire, spewing plumes of black smoke over the city and sending more than 15,000 residents to hospital for medical help‚Äù. Such arrangements are no longer remarkable: the Australian Football League employs about 30 journalists to write friendly stories. Many free local newspapers in the UK are funded by the very councils they should be holding to account. It is asking a lot of individuals to sift the real from the fake when they are bombarded by information ‚Äì how do they know who to trust?

Trust in all kinds of established institutions ‚Äì including the media ‚Äì is at an historic low. This is not a blip, and it should not be a surprise, when so many institutions have failed the people who trusted them and responded to criticism with contempt. As a result, people feel outraged but powerless ‚Äì nothing they do seems to stop these things happening, and nobody seems to be listening to their stories.

This has created a crisis for public life, and particularly for the press, which risks becoming wholly part of the same establishment that the public no longer trusts. At a moment when people are losing faith in their ability to participate in politics and make themselves heard, the media can play a critical role in reversing that sense of alienation.

‚ÄúIf mistrust in institutions is changing how people participate in civics, news organisations might need to change as well,‚Äù the MIT professor Ethan Zuckerman has argued. ‚ÄúWe could rethink our role as journalists as helping people ‚Ä¶ find the places where they, individually and collectively, can be the most effective and powerful.‚Äù

To do this well, journalists must work to earn the trust of those they aim to serve. And we must make ourselves more representative of the societies we aim to represent. Members of the media are increasingly drawn from the same, privileged sector of society: this problem has actually worsened in recent decades. According to the government‚Äôs 2012 report on social mobility in the UK, while most professions are still ‚Äúdominated by a social elite‚Äù, journalism lags behind medicine, politics and even law in opening its doors to people from less well-off backgrounds. ‚ÄúIndeed,‚Äù the report concludes, ‚Äújournalism has had a greater shift towards social exclusivity than any other profession.‚Äù

This matters because people from exclusive, homogenous backgrounds are unlikely to know anyone adversely affected by the crises of our era, or to spend time in the places where they are happening. Media organisations staffed largely by people from narrow backgrounds are less likely to recognise the issues that people notice in their communities every day as ‚Äúnews‚Äù; the discussions inside such organisations will inevitably be shaped by the shared privilege of the participants.

After 71 people died in the devastating Grenfell Tower fire in west London ‚Äì which residents had forewarned for years ‚Äì the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow said that the failure to attend to these warnings showed that the media was ‚Äúcomfortably with the elite, with little awareness, contact or connection with those not of the elite.‚Äù As Gary Younge, the Guardian editor-at-large, has put it: ‚Äú‚ÄòThey‚Äô are not ‚Äòus‚Äô ‚Äì ‚Äòtheir‚Äô views are not often heard in newsrooms, and they know it.‚Äù

If journalists become distant from other people‚Äôs lives, they miss the story, and people don‚Äôt trust them. The Guardian is not at all exempt from these challenges, and our staff is not diverse enough. Because of our history, values and purpose, we are committed to addressing these issues ‚Äì but there is still a long way to go.

Meanwhile, those in power have exploited distrust of the media to actively undermine the role of journalism in the public interest in a democracy ‚Äì from Donald Trump calling the ‚Äúfake news‚Äù media ‚Äúthe enemy of the American people‚Äù to a British cabinet member suggesting that broadcasters should be ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù in their Brexit reporting. All over the world ‚Äì in Turkey, Russia, Poland, Egypt, China, Hungary, Malta and many other countries ‚Äì powerful interests are on the march against free speech. Journalists are undermined, attacked, even murdered.

In these disorientating times, championing the public interest ‚Äì which has always been at the heart of the Guardian‚Äôs mission ‚Äì has become an urgent necessity. People are understandably anxious in the face of crises that are global, national, local and personal. At the global level, these crises are overwhelming: climate change, the refugee crisis, the rise of a powerful super-rich who bestride the global economy. It is easy to feel that humanity is facing a great shift, about which we were not consulted. Overwhelming technological, environmental, political and social change has precipitated what the philosopher Timothy Morton memorably describes as ‚Äúa traumatic loss of co-ordinates‚Äù for all of us.

These global upheavals have plainly destabilised national politics, producing the shocks and surprises of the past two years: the unexpected result of the Brexit referendum, which leaves Britain facing a deeply uncertain future; the stunning election of Donald Trump; the collapse of support for traditional parties across Europe, and the unexpected rise of Emmanuel Macron. These events confounded the experts and the insiders who confidently declared them impossible. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to have torn up the rulebook that had governed electoral politics for two decades ‚Äì finding a surge of support in the June snap election, particularly with young people, by promoting socialist ideas that had long been dismissed. Bernie Sanders tapped into a similar mood in the US Democratic primary.

Skyrocketing inequality between the rich and poor has bred resentment at the political and economic establishment. In October it was revealed that the world‚Äôs super-rich now hold the greatest concentration of wealth for 120 years ‚Äì many of them taking elaborate steps to avoid tax in the process, as the Paradise Papers showed.

Paradise Papers leak reveals secrets of the world elite's hidden wealth Read more

What is becoming clear is that the way things have been run is unsustainable. We are at a turning point in which, in writer Naomi Klein‚Äôs words, ‚Äúthe spell of neoliberalism has been broken, crushed under the weight of lived experience and a mountain of evidence‚Äù. (Klein defines neoliberalism as ‚Äúshorthand for an economic project that vilifies the public sphere‚Äù.) Perhaps the markets don‚Äôt have all the answers after all. The Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, who says that many had not understood how ‚Äúradical the implications‚Äù of worsening inequality would be, suggests that the political backlash to globalisation could possibly produce a ‚Äúfundamental transformation of the world ‚Äì at least as significant as the one that brought about the first world war and the Russian revolution.‚Äù

In many local areas, in our neighbourhoods and our communities, we see the collapse of civic life, from public space sold off cheaply to developers to the closing of libraries to the underfunding of schools and hospitals. It is not hard to imagine what has produced the growing tide of resentment that has shaken our politics. It is painful to see the rich getting away with it in the big cities while you‚Äôre struggling in your small town. Older people lament the loss of community life; younger people are unlikely to be able to find a good job or afford somewhere decent to live.

All of these dislocations have led to another set of crises at a personal level. This year, the World Health Organisation announced that cases of depression had ballooned in the past decade, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide. Loneliness is now being recognised as an epidemic throughout the west.

Our lives are increasingly atomised, but you can see the pleasure that comes from communal or civic participation. People long to help each other, to be together, to share experiences, to be part of a community, to influence the powers that control their lives. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If we once emphasised the revolutionary idea that ‚Äúcomment is free‚Äù, today our priority is to ensure that ‚Äúfacts are sacred‚Äù.

The stark message from Ant√≥nio Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: ‚ÄúHumanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back ‚Äì and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes ‚Ä¶ Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.‚Äù

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) ‚Äì which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible ‚Äì and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

‚ÄúMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,‚Äù he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. ‚ÄúIt must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. ‚ÄúThis is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test ‚Ä¶ We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.‚Äù

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable ‚Äì even in rich countries ‚Äì were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Ni√±a weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: ‚ÄúI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year ‚Äì the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.‚Äù

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to ‚Äúflick the green switch‚Äù while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days‚Äô time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: ‚ÄúWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.‚Äù

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. ‚ÄúNext year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,‚Äù he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. ‚ÄúThere is no vaccine against climate warming,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúBut there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.‚Äù

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

‚ÄúMoney, money, money,‚Äù said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. ‚ÄúThe question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.‚Äù

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK‚Äôs spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host‚Äôs leverage in bringing developing countries together.

‚ÄúA country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
573,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"An alleged ‚Äúbribery for pardon‚Äù scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered ‚Äúa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence‚Äù.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the ‚Äúbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äù, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the ‚Äúsubject or target‚Äù of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. ‚ÄúPardon investigation is Fake News!‚Äù he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‚Äòbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äô is.‚Äù

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro tweeted: ‚ÄúIn 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day ‚Äì but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a ‚Äúpre-emptive pardon‚Äù. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives‚Äô intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt presume ‚Äì and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

‚ÄúIt may be someone that we‚Äôve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.‚Äù

575,'I saw people dying on the road': Tigray's traumatised war refugees,[],"When Ethiopia‚Äôs army shelled Humera, a small agricultural city in Tigray, in mid-November, 54-year-old Gush Tela rushed his wife and three children to safety in a nearby town.

A few days later, he felt compelled to find out what had become of his home. As he approached the city on his motorbike, riding through the arid countryside, he said the stench of countless dead bodies filled the air.

Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said.

‚ÄúI saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,‚Äù Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.‚Äù

Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia‚Äôs prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region‚Äôs ruling party, the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies.

Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents ‚Äì and who was responsible.

On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia‚Äôs government had signed a deal to allow ‚Äúunimpeded‚Äù humanitarian access to Tigray ‚Äì at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people.

Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. ‚ÄúI was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never felt this situation would ever happen.‚Äù



Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba.

Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces.

At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia‚Äôs governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency.

About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted.

Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies.

Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost two crisis on top of each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.‚Äù

Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility.



Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù Tigrayans.

The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes.



Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia.

For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. ‚ÄúIt was very successful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.‚Äù

Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. ‚ÄúBut those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,‚Äù he said.

With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet.

He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we‚Äôre serving 200 patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of drugs every time, so we‚Äôre using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.‚Äù

Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. ‚ÄúRespiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.‚Äù

Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. ‚ÄúWe were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,‚Äù he said.

Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren‚Äôt accessing treatment.

Women‚Äôs reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap.

Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray‚Äôs leadership.

Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias. She accused Abiy of exploiting ethnic divisions and fuelling resentment. ‚ÄúIt is purely ethnic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe country was fair but Abiy wanted all the power. The government made it seem that the problems with Ethiopia were because of Tigray.‚Äù

The rest of her family remains in Tigray. ‚ÄúMy life is there, my family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just waiting to see if things improve.‚Äù

576,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc‚Äôs chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as ‚Äúderisory‚Äù by Downing Street.

On the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

‚ÄúBarnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rush?‚Äô‚Äù said one senior EU diplomat. ‚ÄúAmbassadors for every country bordering the UK ‚Äì 11 all in all ‚Äì raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.‚Äù

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. ‚ÄúThe EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,‚Äù a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in ‚Äúembryo‚Äù.

An EU diplomat said: ‚ÄúWe are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

‚ÄúAs we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.‚Äù

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe‚Äôs coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

577,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain‚Äôs hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,‚Äù he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI want to make sure we‚Äôre going to fight like hell by investing in America first.‚Äù He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America‚Äôs domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden‚Äôs priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his ‚Äúgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China‚Äôs abusive practices ‚Äì that‚Äôs stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations‚Äù and forcing ‚Äútech transfers‚Äù from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. ‚ÄúThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our ‚Äì or at least what used to be our ‚Äì allies on the same page. It‚Äôs going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.‚Äù

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.‚Äù He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal ‚Äúwith the nuclear programme‚Äù.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. ‚ÄúAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,‚Äù he said.

Then, Biden added: ‚ÄúIn consultation with our allies and partners, we‚Äôre going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran‚Äôs nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.‚Äù He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal ‚Äì France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China ‚Äì to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
578,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja‚Äôi Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband‚Äôs aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: ‚ÄúThe procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.‚Äù

The UN said he had been ‚Äúreportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process‚Äù and then ‚Äúforced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras‚Äù.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilm√®s, Belgium‚Äôs deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to ‚Äúdiscuss consular issues‚Äù on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

579,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation‚Äôs special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada‚Äôs so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada‚Äôs elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

The Canadian soldiers took horrific ‚Äútrophy‚Äù photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada‚Äôs own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada‚Äôs defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette ‚Äì who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take ‚Äì said that in Canada‚Äôs case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking at the experience that we had, where there were ‚Ä¶ war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn‚Äôt think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it‚Äôs actually worked out.‚Äù

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

‚ÄúIn a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn‚Äôt seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,‚Äù Collenette said.

He said Canada‚Äôs approach ‚Äì disbandment coupled with major organisational reform ‚Äì has been ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù.

No Canadian government ‚Äì conservative or liberal ‚Äì has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

‚ÄúIt was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we‚Äôd fought in world wars, and we‚Äôd never had anything like this.‚Äù

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

‚ÄúEven when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,‚Äù Collenette said. ‚ÄúWe did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it‚Äôs 25 years after the fact.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
580,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has condemned the behaviour of MEP J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Sz√°jer‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúWhat our representative, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,‚Äù said Orb√°n on Wednesday evening. He said Sz√°jer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orb√°n‚Äôs government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Sz√°jer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary‚Äôs constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium‚Äôs coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Sz√°jer‚Äôs resignation. ‚ÄúHe made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,‚Äù it read.

Prior to Orb√°n‚Äôs intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

‚ÄúMr Sz√°jer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,‚Äù said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Sz√°jer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region‚Äôs deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him ‚Äúfleeing along the gutter‚Äù to escape the raid.

Sz√°jer admitted he had been at a ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Sz√°jer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Sz√°jer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. ‚ÄúI always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something ‚Äì just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,‚Äù he said. He added that guests had been ‚Äúcompletely naked‚Äù at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Sz√°jer for possession of drugs. But the ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Sz√°jer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Sz√°jer boasted that he had drafted Hungary‚Äôs new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as ‚Äúa 21st-century constitution‚Äù when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Sz√°jer said: ‚ÄúIt depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don‚Äôt think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.‚Äù

In the intervening decade, Orb√°n‚Äôs government has gone further in its ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orb√°n‚Äôs government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, ‚Äúthe mother is a woman and the father is a man‚Äù. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government‚Äôs justification for the amendment explained that ‚Äúnew, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development‚Äù.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Sz√°jer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making ‚Äúa huge political deal out of a sex scandal‚Äù and praised Sz√°jer‚Äôs statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary‚Äôs government.

581,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 13 and a half months over protest,[],"The high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong will spend more than a year in jail over an unauthorised protest outside police headquarters in June last year, a court in the city has ruled.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong‚Äôs recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

‚ÄúThe court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court‚Äôs view, made the case more serious,‚Äù the judge said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: ‚ÄúEveryone hang in there, add oil,‚Äù using a phrase of encouragement meaning ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: ‚ÄúI will hang in there.‚Äù

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù in his stomach, according to a post on the activist‚Äôs social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday‚Äôs sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted ‚Äúanother blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong‚Äù.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. ‚ÄúI urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,‚Äù he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong‚Äôs arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù and described it as ‚Äúanother example of HK authorities targeting activists‚Äù.

Wong has maintained a defiant approach during the court case, saying last week: ‚ÄúI am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.‚Äù

He also urged people to focus on the plight of the ‚ÄúHong Kong 12‚Äù, the detained group accused of attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat in August. They have been held in a mainland detention centre ever since, with their families accusing authorities of denying the group access to lawyers, visitors, or medical treatment.

Chow, who gave up her British citizenship to run in Hong Kong elections, was one of the first Demosisto politicians barred from standing for office because the party advocated ‚Äúself-determination‚Äù.

One of her most successful roles has been bringing international attention to Hong Kong‚Äôs democracy movement, aided by her fluency in English, Cantonese and Japanese. She built a huge social media following in Japan in particular. Chow was arrested in August under the national security law, on the vague suspicion of ‚Äúcolluding with foreign forces‚Äù.

At least 31 people have been arrested under the national security law imposed by Beijing in late June, which outlaws a broad range of acts as sedition, secession, foreign collusion, and terrorism.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
582,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim‚Äôs daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother‚Äôs death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: ‚ÄúDirect fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.‚Äù

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had ‚Äúfractures of the entire right hemifacial bone‚Äù. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim‚Äôs chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane‚Äôs apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded ‚Äúthe weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police‚Äù. It added: ‚ÄúThere is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired‚Äù, and concluded the grenade had ‚Äúhit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection‚Äù.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that ‚Äúthere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas‚Äù. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

‚ÄúThere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,‚Äù the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: ‚ÄúIt was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.‚Äù

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. ‚ÄúShe was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,‚Äù Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

‚ÄúThe police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.‚Äù

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

‚ÄúThis is a political issue. It‚Äôs important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

‚ÄúMr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.‚Äù

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by ‚Äúscientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts‚Äù who had examined the ‚Äúangle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,‚Äù he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
583,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November‚Äôs presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

‚ÄúNot a day goes by where there‚Äôs not a crowd outside,‚Äù Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump‚Äôs election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù was Giuliani‚Äôs response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani‚Äôs 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

Others have requested selfies with the business‚Äôs branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

‚ÄúThis is a construction yard, that‚Äôs a liability,‚Äù Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

‚ÄúIt did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‚ÄòWho knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?‚Äô‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians‚Äô incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a ‚ÄúPowerBall‚Äù number of 10 were the South African national lottery‚Äôs winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (¬£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

‚ÄúCongratulations to tonight‚Äôs 20 winners of PowerBall draw,‚Äù the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThese numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.‚Äù

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a ‚Äúmob attorney‚Äù.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump‚Äôs claims, ‚Äúwas the most secure in American history‚Äù.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit ‚Äì and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

‚ÄúAnybody who thinks the election went well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.‚Äù

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to ‚Äúundermine democracy ‚Ä¶ to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people‚Äù.

Trump called that interview ‚Äúridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke‚Äù.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president‚Äôs disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump‚Äôs legal team was ‚Äútalking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I‚Äôve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre going to have to be dealt with politically. It‚Äôs the only way you deal with these people.‚Äù

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden‚Äôs win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThreats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It‚Äôs behavior befitting a mob attorney.‚Äù

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made ‚Äúa retaliatory threat involving Krebs‚Äô official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351‚Äù.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and DiGenova should ‚Äúface disbarment at least‚Äù.

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors ‚Äì violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president‚Äôs aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady‚Äôs spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, ‚Äúwhile providing the safest environment possible.‚Äù She said that would include smaller guest lists, that ‚Äúmasks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending the parties will be a very personal choice,‚Äù she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

‚ÄúIf the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,‚Äù Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms‚Äô content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a ‚Äúmust-pass‚Äù because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won‚Äôt agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he ‚Äúmight have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical‚Äù about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúLost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American tragedy and it‚Äôs essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world‚Äôs population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths ‚Äì more than 268,000 ‚Äì with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: ‚ÄúThe team I‚Äôm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.‚Äù

His ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: ‚ÄúReward hard work in America, not wealth. It‚Äôs time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It‚Äôs time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.‚Äù

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Neera a long time,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.‚Äù

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that‚Äôs dumb.‚Äù

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders‚Äôs 2020 campaign, tweeted: ‚ÄúEverything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.‚Äù

For Biden, Tuesday‚Äôs sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump‚Äôs false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden‚Äôs victory, meaning Trump‚Äôs legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

The electoral college, which selects the president based on state-by-state results, is scheduled to meet on 14 December. Biden will take office on 20 January.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
588,Wisconsin and Arizona certify Biden wins in yet another blow to Trump,[],"Joe Biden‚Äôs victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump‚Äôs longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden‚Äôs nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

‚ÄúToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,‚Äù Wisconsin‚Äôs governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.‚Äù

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden‚Äôs lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin‚Äôs Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.‚Äù

Kaul noted that Trump‚Äôs recount targeted only the state‚Äôs two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. ‚ÄúI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn‚Äôt a game of gotcha.‚Äù

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state‚Äôs 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden‚Äôs overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump‚Äôs legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden‚Äôs narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

The 2020 election is over again, with certifications today in Arizona and Wisconsin. After last week's certifications in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. all of the states where Trump has launched spurious claims against the outcome have now certified Biden's victory. ‚Äî Susan Glasser (@sbg1) November 30, 2020

Arizona‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

‚ÄúWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,‚Äù Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election ‚Äúwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona‚Äôs laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary‚Äù.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump‚Äôs lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the ‚Äúgreatest scam ever perpetrated against our country‚Äù. When he mentioned Ducey‚Äôs name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of ‚Äúrushing to sign‚Äù papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: ‚ÄúArizona won‚Äôt forget what Ducey just did.‚Äù

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.‚Äù

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone‚Äôs ringtone for calls from the White House is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

Trump‚Äôs denials of political reality have left him increasingly isolated as a growing number of Republicans acknowledge the transition and Biden moves ahead with naming appointments to his administration.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.

Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes programme on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere is no foreign power that is flipping votes. There‚Äôs no domestic actor flipping votes. I did it right. We did it right. This was a secure election.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
589,Coronavirus live news: Germany extends restrictions to 10 January; Putin orders start of mass inoculation,[],"18:01

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
590,Mexico: L√≥pez Obrador says pandemic lockdowns fashionable among dictators,[],"Mexicos‚Äôs President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador suggested on Wednesday that politicians who impose lockdowns or curfews to limit Covid-19 are acting like dictators.

The comments came as L√≥pez Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask, saying it was a question of liberty.

The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people‚Äôs movements are ‚Äúfashionable among authorities ‚Ä¶ who want to show they are heavy-handed, dictatorship.

‚ÄúA lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúthe fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty.‚Äù

L√≥pez Obrador‚Äôs comments came a day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Mexico was ‚Äúin bad shape‚Äù with the pandemic and urged its leaders to take the coronavirus seriously.

‚ÄúThe number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,‚Äù said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In his commments on Wednesday, it was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries, or the mainly opposition-party local leaders in Mexico.

Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes, something L√≥pez Obrador has fiercely resisted doing, arguing some people live day-to-day on what they earn on the streets.

Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement, which resulted in scandals of abusive behavior by police.

L√≥pez Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary.

‚ÄúEveryone is free. Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so,‚Äù L√≥pez Obrador said.

The Mexican government has gone against the grain of international anti-virus practices in two ways. It has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks, and has described mass testing as wasteful and pointless.

Mexico has seen almost 107,000 test-confirmed deaths so far, the fourth-highest toll in the world, but Mexico does relatively little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is closer to 150,000.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for rollout next week Read more

It said the pandemic had already triggered ‚Äúunprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour‚Äù and warned of a new wave of criminal activity ‚Äúin relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs ‚Äúplan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives‚Äù, the Interpol secretary general, J√ºrgen Stock, said.

‚ÄúIt is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of ‚Äúunauthorised and falsified‚Äù coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

592,France will carry out border checks to stop skiers from spreading Covid,[],"France will carry out random border checks over the holiday season targeting French skiers on their way to and from foreign resorts ‚Äì particularly Switzerland and Spain ‚Äì where slopes stay open, the prime minister, Jean Castex, has said.

‚ÄúThe goal is to avoid French citizens getting contaminated. That will be done by performing random checks at the borders,‚Äù Castex told French television, adding that returning holidaymakers would be ordered to quarantine for seven days.

While Alpine resorts in France will technically be open over Christmas, ski lifts and other essential winter sports infrastructure, as well as bars and restaurants, will not as the country strives to avoid fuelling a third wave of the coronavirus.

Italy and Germany share the French position and have indicated, to the fury of many local businesses, that their pistes will remain in effect closed over the Christmas and new year periods, which can account for up to 20% of some resorts‚Äô income.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, last week joined Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in calling for a Europe-wide shutdown of winter sports until 10 January.

Coronavirus clusters in Alpine resorts such as Austria‚Äôs Ischgl played a key role in the spread of the virus during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, with holidaymakers bringing Covid-19 back home following ski trips abroad.

Austria also said on Wednesday that while skiing could resume on 24 December, lift capacity would be limited, bars, restaurants, and hotels would remain largely closed until January, and people entering the country from abroad would have to quarantine.

The measures in effect mean skiiing will only be possible over the holiday season for locals who live close to the slopes. The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it should be possible ‚Äúfor a large part of our population to go skiing at least for the day‚Äù.

Conte asked Italians not to take to the slopes at all during the Christmas holidays, and called on all other European countries with major winter sports sectors to agree common rules to prevent cases being imported if Italy‚Äôs pistes stayed closed.

‚ÄúIt will not be possible to allow winter sports holidays this year, we cannot afford it,‚Äù the Italian prime minister said, arguing that despite a strict safety protocol devised by operators, ‚Äúeverything revolving around holidays on the snow is uncontrollable‚Äù.

Switzerland and Spain, however, have so far proved reluctant to impose restrictions. The Swiss interior minister, Alain Berset, said last week the country was ‚Äúautonomous. We can decide for ourselves whether we leave ski areas open. But we know what‚Äôs at stake.‚Äù

The Swiss government is expected to formally announce its position on limiting foreign visitors on Friday, while the Spanish government is still consulting with its autonomous regions on what measures to take.

Castex said on Wednesday that Switzerland and Spain were ‚Äúnot thus far falling into line‚Äù, but that ‚Äúdiplomatic action is continuing ‚Äì the die has not been completely cast‚Äù. He said he would continue ‚Äúto protect my fellow citizens by preventing them from going to contaminate themselves‚Äù, adding that the French measures were also ‚Äúabout being fair to French resort managers‚Äù.

One French resort, Ch√¢tel in the Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area, has draped Swiss flags around the village in protest against France‚Äôs stance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem with a French government that shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,‚Äù the mayor, Nicolas Rubin, said.

Macron had indicated on Tuesday that the French government was considering taking ‚Äúrestrictive and dissuasive measures‚Äù to prevent the French from going abroad to ski, especially in Switzerland, over the holiday period.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said this week that the risk of catching Covid-19 while actually skiing was minimal. ‚ÄúI suspect many people won‚Äôt be infected barrelling down the slopes on their skis,‚Äù he said.

But he said the real risks ‚Äúare going to come at airports, tour buses taking people to and from ski resorts, ski lifts ... and places where people come together‚Äù. The WHO was advising all countries to ‚Äúlook at their ski season‚Äù, he said, warning that indoor socialising after skiing might pose a particular threat.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.‚Äù

There were still ‚Äúimmense logistical challenges‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúSo it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it‚Äôs all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we‚Äôre not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.‚Äù

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning‚Äôs press conference announcing the vaccine‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAnd what a momentous ‚Ä¶ journey and international effort it has been,‚Äù Van-Tam said. ‚ÄúDiscovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.‚Äù

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. ‚ÄúIf we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‚ÄòOh, the vaccine‚Äôs here, let‚Äôs abandon caution,‚Äô all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.‚Äù

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a ‚Äúcomplex product‚Äù and ‚Äúreally tricky to handle‚Äù, explaining: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.‚Äù

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was ‚Äúgoing to eradicate coronavirus ever‚Äù, but we may get to the point where it becomes ‚Äúa seasonal problem‚Äù like flu. He added: ‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us,‚Äô like the end of the war? No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

594,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to ‚Äúsure and certain knowledge that we will succeed‚Äù after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel ‚Äúquite emotional‚Äù.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected ‚Äì including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions ‚Äì it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

‚ÄúBecause of Brexit, we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,‚Äù Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK ‚Äì and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law ‚Äì but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,‚Äù he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid ‚Äúoveroptimism‚Äù and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England‚Äôs lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

‚ÄúIt will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,‚Äù he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it‚Äôs going to be with humankind forever,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us!‚Äô like the end of the war?

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt. I think those kind of habits, that we‚Äôve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ‚Ä¶ on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called ‚Äúa real cause for concern‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,‚Äù he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said ‚Äúeveryone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut‚Äù in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.‚Äù

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

‚ÄúThis authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
595,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own ‚Äúrobust‚Äù approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, contrasting the UK approach with the ‚Äúpace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly‚Äù.

The EMA said the bloc‚Äôs member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the ‚Äúappropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens‚Äô access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns‚Äù.

Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. ‚ÄúWe have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.‚Äù

The EMA‚Äôs statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included ‚Äúessential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign‚Äù.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation ‚Äúare not expected to affect significantly vaccines‚Äô availability‚Äù. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. ‚ÄúIn years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity‚Äôs charge against this disease,‚Äù he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: ‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don‚Äôt think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.‚Äù

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: ‚ÄúWe may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.‚Äù

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: ‚ÄúIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.‚Äù

596,Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans,[],"Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a ‚Äúsuper-spreader event‚Äù.

The gathering, called ‚ÄúNaughty in N‚Äôawlins‚Äù saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event‚Äôs organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

‚ÄúIf I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,‚Äù Hannaford wrote.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.‚Äù

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N‚Äôawlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

‚ÄúWhen we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,‚Äù Hannaford said.

‚ÄúIn almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‚ÄòFuck it, it‚Äôs our last day‚Äô and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.‚Äù

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

‚ÄúWe did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‚ÄòNo Dancing‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn‚Äôt really outlaw dancing.

‚ÄúBut seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

‚ÄúPeople bounced and moved by their tables, and even though people were more spread out, I saw a lot more eye contact and positive acknowledgment of short flirts and teases.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
597,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan‚Äôs Princess Mako ‚Äì the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne ‚Äì and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom‚Äôs mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan‚Äôs royals; it has also brought the country‚Äôs succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro‚Äôs mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako‚Äôs father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

‚ÄúI approve of them getting married,‚Äù he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. ‚ÄúThe constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.‚Äù

But, he added, Komuro‚Äôs family needed to make a ‚Äúvisible‚Äù response to his mother‚Äôs financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I don‚Äôt think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]‚Äù ‚Äì adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor‚Äôs daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan‚Äôs succession laws, no female member of the imperial family ‚Äì not even the emperor‚Äôs 19-year-old daughter, Aiko ‚Äì can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako‚Äôs younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other ‚Äúirreplaceable‚Äù, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as ‚Äúsomeone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
598,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it‚Äôs been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK‚Äôs first female prime minister?

It‚Äôs a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council‚Äôs controversial decision to underwrite a ¬£100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: ‚ÄúWe find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúShe was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country‚Äôs has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.‚Äù

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long hard road. There‚Äôs been a few knocks and bumps along the way,‚Äù Schonhut said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see things finally coming to fruition.‚Äù

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit like a mini Brexit,‚Äù she said. She hopes it‚Äôll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . ‚ÄúIn the area we‚Äôre living in we‚Äôre seeing a huge number of homeless people, we‚Äôre seeing food banks springing up all over the place.‚Äù

Burgess added that given Thatcher‚Äôs controversial legacy it was a ‚Äúpoorly judged decision‚Äù to push ahead with the statue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.‚Äù

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

‚ÄúI appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it‚Äôs a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.‚Äù

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. ‚ÄúThe first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
599,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, ‚Äúa lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?‚Äù Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry ‚Äì but rarely their male counterparts ‚Äì have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt find a mother as appealing‚Äù. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had ‚Äúunderestimated this whole mommy thing‚Äù.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry‚Äôs disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children‚Äôs perspective on her last album (‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre going but you don‚Äôt say how long for / You say it‚Äôs work, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US ‚Äúnearly tore me apart‚Äù, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds ‚Äì leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms ‚Äì moving from the ‚Äúfemale pop star‚Äù category to the even more restrictive ‚Äúmum‚Äù box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

‚ÄúI hardly ever get asked about being a father,‚Äù says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter‚Äôs future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly‚Äôs Tom Fletcher ‚Äì whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I‚Äôm a Celebrity ‚Ä¶ contestant Giovanna Fletcher ‚Äì says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

‚ÄòWe knew we could have a support structure‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Thurston Moore and daughter Coco in 1995. Photograph: John Zich/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another human being.‚Äô So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.‚Äù Hot Chip‚Äôs Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children ‚Äúget upset when I am about to go away‚Äù, they ‚Äúunderstand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not only their own family‚Äôs financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for ‚Äì their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to let anyone down by saying, ‚Äòit would be great to do that festival, but we can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt,‚Äô‚Äù he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. ‚ÄúI think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it‚Äôs our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.‚Äù

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician‚Äôs living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by ‚Äúspeeding back during the night‚Äù after shows, and then ‚Äúdoing the school run in the morning‚Äù. Do his peers see that as normal? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúThey think that‚Äôs mad!‚Äù Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives‚Äô respective due dates, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a band, people expect to see you on stage,‚Äù says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,‚Äù he later said. Fletcher ‚Äì who had his first child ‚Äútwo weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career‚Äù ‚Äì was equally untroubled by the experience. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.‚Äù

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. ‚ÄúAbout 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live ‚Äì we drove our family car with him,‚Äù he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife‚Äôs mother) travelled ‚Äúall around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe‚Äù, an undertaking he describes as ‚Äúpretty easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot too hectic‚Äù.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth‚Äôs huge success during the decade: ‚ÄúWe made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.‚Äù Any earlier ‚Äúwould have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. ‚ÄúEveryone was there to give us everything we needed.‚Äù

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. ‚ÄúThe only person who would ever do that is a band‚Äôs manager and they might say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs going to impact on our finances‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù says Goddard. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.‚Äù The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. ‚ÄúHot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,‚Äù Goddard says. ‚ÄúThe band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.‚Äù Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules ‚Äúpretty challenging‚Äù, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out‚Äù.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of ‚Äúmum guilt‚Äù ‚Äì the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children ‚Äì men have the much milder husband guilt. ‚ÄúMy worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,‚Äù says Spearman, with Goddard adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have ‚Äì my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn‚Äôt have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.‚Äù

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,‚Äù says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn‚Äôt mind him taking paternity leave, ‚Äúif a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that‚Äôs different.‚Äù Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop ‚Äì ‚Äúthere are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older‚Äù ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúthe hormones, what happens to your body‚Äù that men don‚Äôt experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don‚Äôt have any children: ‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt really get those questions: ‚ÄòAre you going to settle down and have a child?‚Äô Women must be asked about it all the time.‚Äù When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. ‚ÄúI would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‚ÄòI probably will have some kids.‚Äô‚Äù

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon‚Äôs work ‚Äúwas going to be interrupted‚Äù. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be focused, but it‚Äôs also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It‚Äôs not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.‚Äù Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact ‚Äì albeit only temporarily. ‚ÄúHaving a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything ‚Äì what my daughter would think in years to come.‚Äù

Little monsters of rock ‚Ä¶ Ozzy Osbourne with son Jack, 1985. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.‚Äù Ghetts says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood‚Äôs cool, fatherhood‚Äôs sick‚Äù.

Goddard is more ambivalent. ‚ÄúMy coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.‚Äù Spearman says Everything Everything didn‚Äôt want to mention fatherhood ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in the press release for their new album, ‚Äúbecause it makes us look a bit old. And it‚Äôs a bit of cliche to be like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve written a record about having a kid,‚Äô which is not what our record is about. We don‚Äôt want to overstate it.‚Äù

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven‚Äôt noticed any real-world implications yet. ‚ÄúWe got playlisted on Radio 1,‚Äù he says happily. ‚ÄúNot bad for a dad band!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
600,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite ‚Äì it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It‚Äôs the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I‚Äôve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I‚Äôve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali‚Äôs fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis‚Äô days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone‚Äôs view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn‚Äôt show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I‚Äôd show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn‚Äôt have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy ‚Äì most photographers don‚Äôt hang around the magazine‚Äôs photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn‚Äôt mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali‚Äôs head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali‚Äôs next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you‚Äôd ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there ‚Äì I went with him once. They‚Äôd wind him up saying: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!‚Äù He‚Äôd reply: ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôd have had him in two rounds!‚Äù

I can count on one hand the athletes I‚Äôve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson‚Äôs disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist‚Äôs ear ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We‚Äôd do a studio shot and he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you 20 minutes‚Äù ‚Äì then an hour later he‚Äôd still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better ‚Äì maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I‚Äôve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

601,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. ‚ÄúTo come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,‚Äù he said.

Watt‚Äôs photographs of the forest ‚Äì and the grim aftermath of logging ‚Äì are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the ‚Äúgraveyard of stumps‚Äù in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we‚Äôre allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people are shocked that that‚Äôs still happening here. It‚Äôs not illegal. The government sanctions it.‚Äù

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province‚Äôs southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island‚Äôs original old growth forests ‚Äì where Watt shot his before-and-after series ‚Äì are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) ‚Äì or about 1% of the deferred areas ‚Äì is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,‚Äù said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. ‚ÄúThat means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.‚Äù

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep taking these ‚Äòbefore‚Äô photos,‚Äù said Watt. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs up to politicians if there‚Äôs going to be an ‚Äòafter‚Äô shot.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
602,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan‚Äôs Netflix epic. Firstly, it‚Äôs just as well The Crown isn‚Äôt on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation‚Äôs enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman‚Äôs Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia ‚Äì not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there‚Äôs nothing. Well, there‚Äôs Prince Charles but Josh O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons‚Äô Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn‚Äôt so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen‚Äôs children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana‚Äôs arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù on offer. It‚Äôs a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts ‚Äì for example, there‚Äôs no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II‚Äôs sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn‚Äôt they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling ‚Äì which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed ‚Äúfairytale‚Äù wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it‚Äôs simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there‚Äôs no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures ‚Äì such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II‚Äôs successor refusing to sign a bill into law ‚Äì or mined Britain‚Äôs deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV‚Äôs Victoria and BBC/Showtime‚Äôs The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you‚Äôre watching. In the latest series, there‚Äôs a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew ‚Äì then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal ‚Äì talks to the Queen about his private life. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù she later reflects to her husband. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt change ‚Ä¶‚Äù The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function ‚Äì and the aesthetics ‚Äì of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple‚Äôs courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4‚Äôs comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show‚Äôs writers have recognised that she doesn‚Äôt belong in that world ‚Äì a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it‚Äôs obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there‚Äôs a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic ‚Äì the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period ‚Äì the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there‚Äôs a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan‚Äôs withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations ‚Äì of royals and commoners alike ‚Äì might well wonder whether it‚Äôs all worth it.

603,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you‚Äôre going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They‚Äôve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It‚Äôs too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That‚Äôs fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs not right. They‚Äôve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don‚Äôt have all the best words to do this because I‚Äôm angry. And the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job ‚Ä¶ in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he‚Äôs one of the better ones they‚Äôve got. His family‚Äôs getting harassed now. There‚Äôs a noose out there with his name on it, and it‚Äôs just not right.

I‚Äôve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It‚Äôs just wrong. I can‚Äôt begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

Mr President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We‚Äôre investigating, there‚Äôs always a possibility, I get it. You have the rights to go to the courts. What you don‚Äôt have the ability to do ‚Äì and you need to step up and say this ‚Äì is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed, and it‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs not right ‚Ä¶ all of this is wrong.

DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former US attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better. Mr President, as the secretary said yesterday, people aren‚Äôt giving you the best advice of what‚Äôs actually going on on the ground. It‚Äôs time to look forward. If you want to run for re-election in four years, fine ‚Äì do it. But everything we‚Äôre seeing right now, there‚Äôs not a path. Be the bigger man here, and step in. Tell your supporters: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be violent. Don‚Äôt intimidate.‚Äù All that‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs un-American.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
604,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government‚Äôs ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It‚Äôs both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I‚Äôve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I‚Äôm torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year‚Äôs Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn‚Äôt going to stop transmission. It‚Äôs best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you‚Äôre likely to smell the smoke. It‚Äôs the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area ‚Äì the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you‚Äôre not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they‚Äôre not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government‚Äôs decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn‚Äôt worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I‚Äôm less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
605,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever ‚Äúour‚Äù is and whenever that ‚Äúday‚Äù might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: ‚ÄúOh God, we‚Äôre doing anarchism at the moment ‚Äì it‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism‚Äôs central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there‚Äôs a T-shirt slogan there, I‚Äôm sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father‚Äôs wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. ‚ÄúOf course she wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening‚Äôs source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter‚Äôs adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

‚ÄúHow are you doing, Ryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù he said happily. ‚ÄúLiving the dream.‚Äù

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself ‚Äúto the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active‚Äù. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a ‚Äúmisconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There‚Äôs definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we‚Äôve got a few Thatcherites in our class.‚Äù

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren‚Äôt born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs everything, isn‚Äôt it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.‚Äù Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this ¬£17,000-a-year establishment, she said: ‚ÄúThere were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I‚Äôve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.‚Äù No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that‚Äôs quite a start. ‚ÄúThings have deteriorated quite significantly since then,‚Äù he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it‚Äôs never like that.‚Äù

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of ‚Äúreal‚Äù politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it ‚Äúinteresting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.‚Äù

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view ‚Äì or those of your tribe ‚Äì and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: ‚ÄúNothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.‚Äù

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

606,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it,[],"When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday‚Äôs news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours ‚Äì a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn‚Äôt really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government‚Äôs proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone ‚Äì regardless of nationality or political affiliation ‚Äì is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
607,The Guardian view on Poland‚Äôs Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Krak√≥w, Marek Jƒôdraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the European Union‚Äôs Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù clause, Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a ‚Äúneo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God‚Äôs kingdom‚Äù. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender ‚Äúideology‚Äù in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October‚Äôs controversial abortion ruling by Poland‚Äôs constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops‚Äô conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS‚Äôs leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, called on Poles to ‚Äúdefend the church at any price‚Äù. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church‚Äôs authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II‚Äôs judgment was criticised in last month‚Äôs Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope‚Äôs secretary, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church‚Äôs steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczy≈Ñski, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to ‚Äúabandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance‚Äù. Their statement denounced attempts to ‚Äúexploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party‚Äù. If the country‚Äôs ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, umm ‚Ä¶ got really into jigsaws for a bit.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a ‚Äúsign of a life falling apart‚Äù to something I was doing ‚Äúfor the moral good of the country and the world as a whole‚Äù, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I‚Äôd thrive in the ambient boredom of prison ‚Äì not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I‚Äôd get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That‚Äôs not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one ‚Äì no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing ‚Äì but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it‚Äôs psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it‚Äôs possibly even worse that we‚Äôve worn boredom down to the bone. If we‚Äôve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself ‚Äì someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something ‚Äì the answer can only be ‚Äúchaos‚Äù.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won‚Äôt be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much ‚Äì stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it‚Äôs hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We‚Äôre all tiptoeing around the idea that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It‚Äôs hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I‚Äôm certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

609,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we‚Äôve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world‚Äôs human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We‚Äôve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some ¬£1.5bn of the UK‚Äôs commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it‚Äôs coming under threat from the government‚Äôs proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don‚Äôt yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map ‚Äì it‚Äôs also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged ¬£7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world‚Äôs most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested ¬£12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed ¬£120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network‚Äôs priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We‚Äôve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, ‚ÄúAntimicrobial resistance ‚Ä¶ threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily‚Äù. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK‚Äôs track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government‚Äôs decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

610,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you‚Äôve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of ‚ÄúDivine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.‚Äù

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn‚Äôt include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for those who haven‚Äôt seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit ‚Äì it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there ‚Äì but somehow it didn‚Äôt really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone‚Äôs accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%‚Äôs mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren‚Äôt one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It‚Äôs weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on ‚Äì giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
611,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found the game cathartic",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix‚Äôs series The Queen‚Äôs Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I‚Äôd ever played anyone, I‚Äôd lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I‚Äôm more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I‚Äôd never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it‚Äôs exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I‚Äôve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other ‚Äì sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny‚Äôs funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they‚Äôd ever known.

But it isn‚Äôt always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny‚Äôs escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was ‚Äì he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I‚Äôd been playing chess for a few months ‚Äì first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online ‚Äì I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I‚Äôd started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He‚Äôs the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It‚Äôs a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

617,Fans are back! But avoid using toilets during peak times,[],"THE RETURN OF PROPER FOOTBALL

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage ‚Äúfootball without fans is nothing‚Äù is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we‚Äôd either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we‚Äôd have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven‚Äôt done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn‚Äôt it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid ‚Äúunnecessary movement‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, without having to purchase a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal‚Äôs poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we‚Äôll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language.

The BBC‚Äôs decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúverification‚Äù from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

‚ÄúThe shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,‚Äù a BBC spokesperson said. ‚ÄúOn this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.‚Äù

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

‚ÄúThis is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I‚Äôve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don‚Äôt vote.‚Äù

Fury‚Äôs initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury‚Äôs team offered a farmer ¬£25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements ‚Äì citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury‚Äôs team to lie. Fury‚Äôs subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as ‚Äútotal bullshit‚Äù.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury ‚Äì who earlier that year had claimed that ‚Äúthere are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.‚Äù

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill‚Äôs father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher‚Äôs F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

‚ÄúThere is a sense that some people don‚Äôt want you to have a go,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI felt like some people felt: ‚ÄòWhy is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.‚Äô It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.‚Äù

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

‚ÄúI wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad‚Äôs life and career and applied them to my racing.

‚ÄúJacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.‚Äù

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

‚ÄúIt really is tragic what happened to Michael,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.‚Äù

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

‚ÄúI have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.‚Äù

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher‚Äôs best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

‚ÄúIn a way it‚Äôs very simple ‚Äì if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
621,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed ‚Äúill-judged criticism‚Äù from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been ‚Äúconvicted of racism‚Äù.

Porto‚Äôs move came after City drew 0-0 at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as ‚Äúan opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism‚Äù.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: ‚ÄúHis tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.‚Äù

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto‚Äôs coach Sergio Concei√ß√£o accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Concei√ß√£o described Silva as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù for a tweet that followed City‚Äôs victory in which the midfielder wrote: ‚ÄúThis one felt so good!‚Äù

Porto‚Äôs newsletter claimed Guardiola had a ‚Äúbad disposition after the meeting‚Äù on Tuesday and quoted Concei√ß√£o as saying: ‚ÄúI would also be upset if I couldn‚Äôt win with the team he has and the budget he has.‚Äù

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: ‚ÄúDespite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt buy class or notion.‚Äù In response a City spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

‚ÄúIn 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.‚Äù

The incident referred to came at the Drag√£o in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City‚Äôs XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: ‚ÄúStrange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn‚Äôt going to work. Clearly selective memory, I‚Äôm sure them receiving a fine for targeting Mario in 2012 just a memory.‚Äù

James‚Äôs agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James‚Äôs contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year‚Äôs NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

625,'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration,[],"Spanish archipelago has received 20,000 migrants and refugees this year, 8,000 in the last month

'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration

In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus.

The streets of Arguinegu√≠n, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon.

Almost 15 years after the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees.

Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018.

Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguinegu√≠n. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguinegu√≠n, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309.

The people held at the temporary centre ‚Äì officially for a maximum of 72 hours ‚Äì are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms.

There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents.

Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system.

Spain‚Äôs public ombudsman has called for the Arguinegu√≠n camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people‚Äôs basic rights.

Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mog√°n, of which Arguinegu√≠n is a part.

Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island‚Äôs capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay.

While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will.

‚ÄúThis lack of humanity from the government just can‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.‚Äù

And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù in 2006.

Jos√© Segura Clavell, who was the central government‚Äôs representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the ‚Äúhumanitarian reception‚Äù to which they are entitled.

If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs behaviour is a mistake,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a clear common policy.‚Äù

The lack of a clear, common ‚Äì and fair ‚Äì approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU‚Äôs new migration and asylum proposals.

‚ÄúWe believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,‚Äù the four countries said.

‚ÄúThe frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.‚Äù

In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguinegu√≠n dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people ‚Äì including more than 455 unaccompanied children ‚Äì are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mog√°n.

But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that ‚ÄúMog√°n‚Äôs solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December‚Äù and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere.

The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after.

‚ÄúIf I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,‚Äù Jalloul said on Thursday.

‚ÄúDo you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?‚Äù

Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry ‚Äì which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible ‚Äì says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks.

Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October ‚Äúin search of a future‚Äù. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister.

But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home.

Kamara says the Canaries ‚Äì ‚Äúa great place‚Äù ‚Äì remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off.

‚ÄúI was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,‚Äù says Kamara.

Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with.

The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain.

For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp ‚Äújust goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago‚Äù.

Like many others ‚Äì not least the regional president of the Canaries ‚Äì Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, ‚Äúviews island territories as prisons‚Äù.

But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries.

In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into.

‚ÄúUntil we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we‚Äôre going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,‚Äù says Santana.

‚ÄúThere will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
626,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain‚Äôs new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her ‚Äúdelight, after many years of campaigning,‚Äù that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens‚Äô right to work and live in UK ‚Äì a key Brexit ask ‚Äì or British nationals‚Äô right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

‚ÄúIt will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,‚Äù said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. ‚ÄúI built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is ‚Ä¶ a shock.‚Äù

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell‚Äôs mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and ‚Äì like his sister ‚Äì two dual-nationality children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very settled; we have careers and families,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not thinking of going home yet.‚Äù

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. ‚ÄúMy big worry is my mother,‚Äù Frizell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fit and well, but if she needed looking after ‚Ä¶ Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now ‚Äì but not for much longer.‚Äù

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, ‚Äúalmost without restriction‚Äù.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù Godfrey said, ‚Äúif you want to come back with your non-British partner, you‚Äôll need to earn ¬£18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they‚Äôll have to meet the new points system.‚Äù

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs ‚Äì NHS surcharges, fees ‚Äì could run into thousands of pounds.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a massive change,‚Äù said Godfrey. ‚ÄúIt basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it‚Äôs asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible choice, and it‚Äôs really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.‚Äù

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. ‚ÄúThe government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.‚Äù

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. ‚ÄúThe government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúWe just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we‚Äôre not talking about a never-ending stream of people ‚Äì it‚Äôs a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It‚Äôs just nonsense.‚Äù

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home ‚Äì and if we don‚Äôt move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It‚Äôs hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.‚Äù

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship ‚Äì but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

‚ÄúIf we wanted to move back we‚Äôd have to go through so many hoops now,‚Äù Woodford said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not sure we‚Äôd meet the minimum income. It‚Äôs seems unfathomable to me ‚Ä¶ Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.‚Äù

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband ‚Äúcould not possibly decide by March 2022‚Äù whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

‚ÄúBut how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years ‚Äì she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that‚Äôs been taken away.‚Äù

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

‚ÄúBrexit means I can‚Äôt do that now, because I don‚Äôt yet have a full residence permit, so I can‚Äôt leave Greece for more than three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that‚Äôs not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.‚Äù

The couple would be ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. ‚ÄúIt just seems so sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people‚Äôs choices taken away ‚Äì all those things my generation could do ‚Ä¶ And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.‚Äù

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

‚ÄúDaniel may want to come back ‚Äì not yet, certainly, but at some stage,‚Äù Barbara said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn‚Äôt look very fair or equal to me.‚Äù

627,"'If the EU says we can‚Äôt open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni‚Äôs grandmother Adelina began the family‚Äôs ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

‚ÄúI have never not known a ski season,‚Äù said Di Bendinoni. ‚ÄúEven the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.‚Äù

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Gernot Bl√ºmel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

‚ÄúIn Italy we‚Äôre in limbo, when you don‚Äôt know what will happen from one day to the next,‚Äù said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni‚Äôs cousin and a ski instructor. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians ‚Äì if the EU says we can‚Äôt open, then they should pay for it.‚Äù

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy‚Äôs third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d‚ÄôOulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgen√®vre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about ‚Ç¨11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere‚Äôs inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

‚ÄúSome got ‚Ç¨600, others ‚Ç¨1,200,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don‚Äôt discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt carry on. We‚Äôre at that level and politicians need to understand.‚Äù

Gianni Poncet, the village‚Äôs mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,‚Äù Poncet said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants ‚Äì across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn‚Äôt begin we will lose ‚Ç¨1bn.‚Äù

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular apr√®s-ski spot, said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.‚Äù

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

‚ÄúEven if people from abroad can‚Äôt come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,‚Äù Giovanni Brasso said. ‚ÄúIn the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.‚Äù

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves ‚Ä¶ and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

'We expected to go back in days': Karabakh truce means exile for some, homecoming for others

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan‚Äôs parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan‚Äôs soldiers reached the settlement‚Äôs outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

‚ÄúWe expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,‚Äù Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. ‚ÄúNobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,‚Äù Safaryan says.

Nagorno-Karabakh: Azerbaijan troops begin retaking land from Armenia Read more

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

‚ÄúWhen we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúEven after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äô It never happened.‚Äù

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

‚ÄúI was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,‚Äù she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. ‚ÄúGeographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.‚Äù

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. ‚ÄúArmenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúWe had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn‚Äôt trustful coexistence.‚Äù

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. ‚ÄúI asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLater we learned it was about unification with Armenia.‚Äù

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. ‚ÄúWe said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúWe even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.‚Äù

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. ‚ÄúSlowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúOne day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,‚Äù Hajiyeva recalls. ‚ÄúAfter that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.‚Äù

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. ‚ÄúI opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,‚Äù she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúMy parents just woke up and realised war had begun.‚Äù

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. ‚ÄúSome days they couldn‚Äôt even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúThey were very bad, very harsh days.‚Äù

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan‚Äôs favour.

‚ÄúThe whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,‚Äù she claims. ‚ÄúThey left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.‚Äù

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh‚Äôs Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan‚Äôs parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. ‚ÄúThey are just existing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what we are going to do.‚Äù

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúSome people were saying, why have you left your city?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.‚Äù

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. ‚ÄúThe house has survived the occupation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what‚Äôs happening in my city.‚Äù

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. ‚ÄúMy friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always prepared myself that once I‚Äôll be back in Shusha, I‚Äôll start my new life from zero.‚Äù

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. ‚ÄúI cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,‚Äù Hajizada said. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.‚Äù

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm nobody now,‚Äù Safaryan says.

‚ÄúEverything I was living and fighting for ‚Äì making plans for big projects in Hadrut and every village and city in Artsakh ‚Äì and now there‚Äôs nothing. Nothing to fight for, and nothing to live for.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
629,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Parliament passes preliminary bill to dissolve itself in move seen as gambit by Benny Gantz to pass budget

Israel‚Äôs parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday‚Äôs vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz‚Äôs Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday‚Äôs bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country‚Äôs longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

‚ÄúNetanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,‚Äù Gantz said. ‚ÄúShow me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: ‚ÄúNetanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.‚Äù

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. ‚ÄúNow is not the time for elections,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúNow is the time for unity.‚Äù

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu‚Äôs ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

‚ÄúI was well aware of his track record as a ‚Äòserial promise-breaker‚Äô, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gantz said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúNetanyahu didn‚Äôt lie to me ‚Äì he lied to all of you.‚Äù

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,‚Äù Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

‚Äú[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,‚Äù wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

‚ÄúThe prime minister‚Äôs ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù slogans like ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

‚ÄúYou lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you‚Äôre actually going to get the changes you want done,‚Äù the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

‚ÄúThe key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?‚Äù Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important ‚Äúnew blood‚Äù in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äì who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president‚Äôs interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats ‚Äì including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù was not about mere words but a ‚Äúdemand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a ‚Äòslogan‚Äô,‚Äù said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge ‚Äì ultimately unsuccessfully ‚Äì the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs seat in the November election.

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù was ‚Äúnot a slogan. It‚Äôs a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Mr President ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about losing people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We‚Äôre losing our loved ones to police violence.‚Äù

The Black Lives Matter movement member‚Äôs rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police ‚Äì a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health ‚Äì factors that contribute to crime.

The former president‚Äôs comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden‚Äôs flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

‚ÄúIf you instead say ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs reform the police department so that everybody‚Äôs being treated fairly,‚Äô‚Äù Clyburn offered alternatively. ‚ÄúNot just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?‚Äô‚Äù

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

‚ÄúShe speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,‚Äù he said, adding that across political ideologies ‚Äúnew blood is always good‚Äù for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
631,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, ‚Äúproductivity score‚Äù, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators ‚Äúhelp their people get the most‚Äù from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

‚ÄúAt Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,‚Äù Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe also believe that privacy is a human right, and we‚Äôre deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.‚Äù

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren‚Äôt contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. ‚ÄúGoing forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level ‚Äì providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,‚Äù Spataro says. ‚ÄúNo one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. ‚ÄúProductivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,‚Äù Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern workforce transformation‚Äù unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

632,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don‚Äôt count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor‚Äôs note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board ‚Äúeroded the public trust in legitimate service animals‚Äù.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people ‚Äúfraudulently representing their pets as service animals‚Äù, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog‚Äôs health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can‚Äôt bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned ‚Äúpit bull type dogs‚Äù in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, ‚ÄúAt this time, there are no changes to Delta‚Äôs current service and support animal policies.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
633,"Covid could derail efforts to eradicate malaria in Pacific, health experts warn",[],"The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

‚ÄúThere are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.‚Äù

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

‚ÄúBut it is malaria that can explode the fastest ‚Äì it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‚Äòcanary in the coalmine‚Äô that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.‚Äù

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia‚Äôs interest.

And a similar proportion ‚Äì 56% ‚Äì believe that if Australia doesn‚Äôt support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

‚ÄúAs a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.‚Äù

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

‚ÄúAustralians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours ‚Ä¶ indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.‚Äù

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia ‚Äúshould these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs‚Äù.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia‚Äôs vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

‚ÄúDoes Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?‚Äù national director Sam Klintworth wrote. ‚ÄúThis equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.‚Äù

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should ‚Äúexplicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia‚Äù.

Last month, a panel of UN public health experts urged governments not to hoard vaccine supplies and called on pharmaceutical companies to share technologies and expertise so all countries can access treatments equally.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was ‚Äústressed and scared‚Äù about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister‚Äôs home in Russia.

‚ÄúI got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams ‚Ä¶ harassing me. I‚Äôm drinking a lot,‚Äù he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I was on the streets ‚Ä¶ [But] I‚Äôm not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúnot hiding‚Äù in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings ‚Äúway in excess‚Äù of the ¬£3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that ¬£3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter‚Äôs mother had become accustomed. ‚ÄúNow maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it‚Äôs different,‚Äù he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her ¬£453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the ¬£30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son‚Äôs emails.

Akhmedova‚Äôs legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband‚Äôs ¬£300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club‚Äôs owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

The case is expected to continue on Monday.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
635,"Strictly dropped us after we asked to be paid, say musicians",[],"A group of professional musicians have said they were dropped by Strictly Come Dancing after they asked to be paid for performing on the programme‚Äôs spinoff show.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day‚Äôs work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have money in the budget to pay for contributors.‚Äù Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a ‚Äúdecent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name‚Äù, which would help boost the band‚Äôs following on Instagram and Facebook.

‚ÄúHopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,‚Äù they were told by the show‚Äôs producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians‚Äô Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: ‚ÄúThe days of ‚Äòit‚Äôll give you exposure‚Äô (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won‚Äôt get any gigs these days and we won‚Äôt sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production ‚Ä¶ They want us and our expertise, but they won‚Äôt pay for it.‚Äù

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: ‚ÄúLike all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven‚Äôt raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven‚Äôt monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

‚ÄúWe do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than ¬£20,000 a year, is a pittance.‚Äù

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly‚Äôs hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: ‚ÄúExternally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.‚Äù

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: ‚ÄúAs we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn‚Äôt happen for editorial reasons.‚Äù

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: ‚ÄúHad they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
636,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste‚Äôs fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share ¬£12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured and privileged and I‚Äôm going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.‚Äù

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery‚Äôs story as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

‚ÄúToday the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

‚ÄúHowever, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

‚ÄúBernard Collaery‚Äôs story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers‚Äô lawyers are now being targeted.‚Äù

Collaery and Witness K‚Äôs cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

The council warned that the laws were protecting ‚Äúbroadly defined national security at the expense of the rights of the accused‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
637,Canadian security firm GardaWorld raises G4S takeover offer to ¬£3.7bn,[],"Investors have two weeks to decide whether to accept final offer of 235p a share in cash

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to ¬£3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at ¬£3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a ¬£770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a ¬£3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

Shares in G4S rose 7.5% to 246p on Wednesday .

GardaWorld‚Äôs chief executive and founder, St√©phan Cr√©tier, said: ‚ÄúShareholders have a simple choice: remain invested in a company which has consistently failed them and the wider community for so many years, or realise their investment in cash, at a significant and highly attractive premium.

‚ÄúG4S needs an owner-operator that understands the people-orientated nature of the sector with the resources, time and expertise to solve the many challenges faced by the business.‚Äù

G4S investors now have until 16 December to decide whether they want to accept GardaWorld‚Äôs final offer.

Last month, G4S said it would start paying a dividend again and claimed the group could reach revenue growth of between 4% and 6% a year if it remained independent.

But the firm reported a ¬£91m loss for 2019 after it was forced to write down the value of its cash handling business. It has also announced plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs to reduce costs.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‚ÄúG4S management have been pushing back for some time against GardaWorld; however, with Allied Universal Security also lurking in the background, G4S shareholders are likely to find this new offer compelling, especially since the shares are up over 50% since the initial September bid.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
638,Nike Japan ad on teenage bullying and racism sparks debate,[],"Two-minute film draws support as ‚Äòamazing‚Äô while others accused company of creating a false impression of Japan

A video made by Nike Japan that explores bullying and racism using three schoolgirl footballers has sparked praise and outrage online, including calls to boycott the company‚Äôs products.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù and beautiful,‚Äù but others were less impressed.

While the film‚Äôs message clearly riled members of Japan‚Äôs online right ‚Äì many of whom commented using pseudonyms ‚Äì more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

‚ÄúIs Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you‚Äôre creating a false impression of Japan,‚Äù said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: ‚ÄúNowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that‚Äôs prejudiced is Nike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so much fun to blame Japan?‚Äù another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country‚Äôs multiracial rugby team at last year‚Äôs world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn‚Äôt Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the ‚Äúzainichi problem‚Äù ‚Äì a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are ‚Äústaying in Japan‚Äù.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world‚Äôs highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka‚Äôs sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she ‚Äúlooked sunburned‚Äù and ‚Äúneeded some bleach‚Äù.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

‚ÄúWe have long listened to minority voices, supported and spoken for causes that fit our values,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe believe sports have the power to show what a better world looks like, to bring people together and encourage action in their respective communities.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
639,World is ‚Äòdoubling down‚Äô on fossil fuels despite climate crisis ‚Äì UN report,[],"The world‚Äôs governments are ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid ‚Äúsevere climate disruption‚Äù. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThe pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,‚Äù said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

‚ÄúAlas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of zombie energy.‚Äù

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: ‚ÄúWith governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year‚Äôs devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,‚Äù said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (¬£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world‚Äôs fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we‚Äôre beginning to see that happen,‚Äù said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: ‚ÄúWorking together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.‚Äù

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: ‚ÄúGovernments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies ‚Äì this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we‚Äôre going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.‚Äù

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to ‚Äúshow climate leadership‚Äù by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: ‚ÄúThe world ‚Äì and its people ‚Äì are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
640,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‚Äòone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äô and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called ‚Äúone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äù.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised ‚Äúthe devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire‚Äù.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the ‚Äúalarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity‚Äù including the decline in New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and MƒÅori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must ‚Äúact with urgency‚Äù.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

‚ÄúThis declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.‚Äù

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service‚Äôs buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the ‚Äúsignificant progress on meeting the challenge‚Äù by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation ‚Äì which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äì made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and had become ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. ‚ÄúThe irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.‚Äù

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: ‚Äú[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs declaration also said the government will ‚Äúdemonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government‚Äôs own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025‚Äù.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs all very well to declare an emergency but there‚Äôs no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,‚Äù Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government‚Äôs fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation‚Äôs biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand‚Äôs pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
641,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world‚Äôs coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world‚Äôs biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries ‚Äì Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal ‚Äì will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction ‚Äì known as exclusive economic zones ‚Äì are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.‚Äù

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: ‚ÄúAustralians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods ‚Ä¶ When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.‚Äù

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world‚Äôs oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was ‚Äúa really big deal‚Äù and could restore the health of the world‚Äôs oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

‚ÄúWhat you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it‚Äôs not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant ‚Äì business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe oceans are in a very sorry state right now.‚Äù

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.‚Äù

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: ‚ÄúIf we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.‚Äù

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world‚Äôs oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of ‚Äúghost‚Äù fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a ‚Äúcircular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik √ñsterblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: ‚Äú[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.‚Äù

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world‚Äôs oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ‚ÄúThe UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
642,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing ‚Äì a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other‚Äôs perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls ‚Äì meaning that they push their joypad‚Äôs thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen ‚Äì the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not per se a topic we‚Äôd study in our lab, we‚Äôd had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,‚Äù explains Corbett. ‚ÄúThis was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.‚Äù

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? ‚ÄúGenerally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúThere are no right or wrong answers in these tasks ‚Äì we‚Äôre interested in how people might perform differently. We‚Äôll obtain one or two measures ‚Äì for example, average reaction time, average accuracy ‚Äì from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.‚Äù

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual‚Äôs visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. ‚ÄúFor example,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.‚Äù

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúMost research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can‚Äôt really process more than a few details at once. There‚Äôs a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.‚Äù

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what‚Äôs on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

‚ÄúSuch findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‚Äòreal‚Äô flight consoles,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúIn a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.‚Äù

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

‚Ä¢ Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

643,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace ‚Äì review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain ‚Äì and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens ‚Äì all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don‚Äôt ‚Äì because, obviously, they weren‚Äôt allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen‚Äôs pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art ‚Äì and this collection ‚Äì to HM using the term ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù. This old school art snob would no more have said ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù than he‚Äôd have said ‚Äútaken to Twitter‚Äù. He‚Äôd have said ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù or ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen‚Äôs Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection‚Äôs finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I‚Äôve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt‚Äôs rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam‚Äôs Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar‚Äôs anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he‚Äôs studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They‚Äôre consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing ‚Ä¶ Rembrandt‚Äôs Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / ¬© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I‚Äôll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It‚Äôs hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here‚Äôs the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He‚Äôd recently lost his wife. A friend ‚Äì thought to be William, Lord Crofts ‚Äì is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck‚Äôs mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer‚Äôs surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they‚Äôre in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It‚Äôs either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens‚Äôs personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There‚Äôs a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi‚Äôs Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show ‚Äì she painted it for Charles I ‚Äì and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection‚Äôs virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I‚Äôm grateful that some of the royal family‚Äôs treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It‚Äôs hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

644,Laura Davis: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet),[],"Hello, I‚Äôm Laura Davis. I‚Äôm an Australian comedian who normally lives in London, but I‚Äôve ended up unexpectedly trapped in New Zealand this year on my way back to Australia. Well, as much as you can be trapped in one of the safest places in the world.

I‚Äôve spent most of 2020 walking around in the woods alone in the day, and scrolling through the internet to check the rest of the world is still there at night. It‚Äôs been nice but I am probably getting a bit of a Jack Torrance vibe.

London and New Zealand are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I haven‚Äôt been home to Australia in years and by now I‚Äôm homesick enough that I‚Äôd probably fall to my knees at the mere waft of a sausage. In the spirit of patriotism, I‚Äôve quarantined this list to the Aussie corner of the internet. (Full disclosure, these internet people are all my real-life friends, but at the moment this is the only way I get to see them too.)

1) This sketch from Mad as Hell that I wish was for a real show

‚ÄòThis country is facing an existential crisis.‚Äô

Writing on Mad As Hell was one of the best jobs I‚Äôve ever gotten to do and I miss working with the team and cast. I‚Äôve really loved watching how they tackled 2020 restrictions and I‚Äôm extremely glad that they were allowed to keep producing the show this year. This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

Engineering numbers.

Speaking of Mad As Hell, Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews are two of the best sketch writers I‚Äôve ever gotten to work with. This is the intro clip for their show MAGMA, which you can go and watch on demand here https://sospresents.com/ along with other incredible Australian comedians like Double Denim and Jude Perl.

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‚ÄòI will just warn you before I go any further ...‚Äô

As a comic it‚Äôs hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She‚Äôs just so good.

4) Steve Irwin being bitten by a snake three seconds after he says it won‚Äôt bite

‚ÄòThe only reason I‚Äôm doing this is because this one‚Äôs a python ...‚Äô

The only not-stand-up clip that I‚Äôve included. The snake has impressive comic timing considering it‚Äôs a snake. Steve Irwin is such a gentleman with beautiful manners. Take a moment to appreciate the dedication of the puppeteer and the host‚Äôs brave gaze. I don‚Äôt know what else you could want.

5) Danielle Walker‚Äôs joke about her grandad‚Äôs grave

‚ÄòHe calls it his man grave.‚Äô

Probably one of the bits I try and retell badly to people the most. Sorry for butchering it at dinner parties, Danielle.

6) This clip from Kirsty Webeck

‚ÄòI had a little nibble.‚Äô

Kirsty has such a delightful energy. This clip was a nice surprise 2020 treat the other week when it came through my feed.

7) Alice Fraser

‚ÄòA bit testerical are we?‚Äô

Alice has a plethora of amazing comedy available online, but this is a great intro if you haven‚Äôt seen her work before. The punchline count in this four and a half minutes is genuinely incredible.

8) Jude Perl‚Äôs Hungry and Horny

‚ÄòProudly brought to you by ...‚Äô

Jude is just plain talented. If I‚Äôm ever having a bad day I put on her albums for an instant boost.

9) Jack Druce ‚Äì just Jack Druce in general

‚ÄòSay what you will about a single bed ...‚Äô

Jack is the most unique joke writer I can think of and I really love his work. It was pretty hard to select my favourite clip so I really recommend watching the full show on his channel. He‚Äôs also got a great newsletter that you can‚Äôt see on the internet unless you sign up for it here.

645,Godmothered review ‚Äì Disney remixes Enchanted ‚Ä¶ minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There‚Äôs the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles ‚Äì swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

It‚Äôs impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney‚Äôs 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor‚Äôs career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland‚Äôs closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams‚Äôs Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there‚Äôs winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom ‚Äì Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor‚Äôs preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor‚Äôs self-centered ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù feels earned. But Godmothered‚Äôs tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother‚Äôs overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there‚Äôs one ‚Äì co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) ‚Äì within reach), but its shoehorned revelation ‚Äì that true loves comes in many forms ‚Äì is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious ‚Äì unrealistic in the parts where it‚Äôs trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor‚Äôs misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a bumpy, underwhelming ride ‚Äì not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
646,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world ‚Äì it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‚ÄòLast night,‚Äù says Laima Leyton, ‚ÄúI went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramoviƒá. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn‚Äôt have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.‚Äù

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists ‚Äì Leyton among them ‚Äì about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly‚Äôs condemnation of petty domesticity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall‚Äù ‚Äì and Tracey Emin‚Äôs oft-quoted line: ‚ÄúThere are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.‚Äù

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,‚Äù painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer‚Äôs wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report‚Äôs data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that‚Äôs not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists‚Äô careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn‚Äôt factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world ‚Äì motherhood. My resulting essay ‚Äì Full, Messy and Beautiful ‚Äì was published alongside this year‚Äôs report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

‚ÄúMy experience,‚Äù Anna Perach told me, ‚Äúis that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‚Äòsold out‚Äô or joined the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.‚Äù

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with ‚Äúthe holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids‚Äù, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can‚Äôt be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn‚Äôt come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn‚Äôt have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? ‚ÄúPaying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,‚Äù said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There‚Äôs now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities ‚Äì buzz, aura, image ‚Äì there is quite simply a problem of perception. ‚ÄúWomen artists are marginalised generally,‚Äù as Jemima Burrill put it. ‚ÄúMothers are almost beyond the pale.‚Äù

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are ‚Äì and have been ‚Äì great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù that a woman cannot excel as both.

647,"Faith review ‚Äì compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains ‚Äúwarrior monks‚Äù in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks‚Äô daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white ‚Äì it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn‚Äôt help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there‚Äôs no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions ‚Äì five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken ‚Äì to fuel his narcissism and ego, I‚Äôd say.

648,‚ÄòAs consumers we all have tremendous impact‚Äô: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we‚Äôre on if we‚Äôre to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you‚Äôre a climate science denier, you‚Äôll be familiar with ‚Äì and anxious to see something done about ‚Äì a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive ‚Äì going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚Äì the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it‚Äôs from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The ‚Äúnatural carbon storage‚Äù of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft‚Äôs target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it‚Äôs a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs a mindset,‚Äù says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. ‚ÄúWe decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We‚Äôre embracing the challenge.‚Äù

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations ‚Äì ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it‚Äôs the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion‚Äôs share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,‚Äô says Henkel‚Äôs Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company‚Äôs direct influence presents challenges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúTake our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can‚Äôt make you switch your energy supplier. But it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.‚Äù

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel‚Äôs global carbon footprint ‚Äì just 2% compared with Ikea‚Äôs 11%, for example ‚Äì the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.‚Äù

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites ‚Äì both thermal and photovoltaic ‚Äì any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company‚Äôs plans.

‚ÄúIf we have the right energy infrastructure in place ‚Äì similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montorn√®s del Vall√®s in Spain, for example ‚Äì we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,‚Äù says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory ‚Äì so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúToday, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It‚Äôs quite a dramatic progress.‚Äù Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: ‚ÄúThe classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it‚Äôs too easy to do right now.‚Äù Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. ‚ÄúThe capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,‚Äù Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. ‚ÄúWe have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,‚Äù says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: ‚ÄúOur products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers ‚Äì and ultimately consumers ‚Äì save energy and carbon.‚Äù

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. ‚ÄúYou, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúDo I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?‚Äù

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. ‚ÄúVideo-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,‚Äù says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. ‚ÄúLaundry won‚Äôt complain if you wash it cold, so that‚Äôs easier. Your clothes will last longer and your electricity bill will be lower,‚Äù says Bergmann, adding that decades of research has enabled Henkel to produce detergents that function at these lower temperatures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about generating a good value proposition ‚Äì the behavioural change will follow.‚Äù

For all the company‚Äôs good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat. The first step to combating this is having a clear breakdown of our own carbon footprints. ‚ÄúThis transparency enables us to make informed choices,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe all need to take gradual steps, rather than just seeing an overwhelming target that we‚Äôll struggle to achieve.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
649,‚ÄòThe holy grail of packaging recycling‚Äô: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there‚Äôs one thing the British public likes to complain about, it‚Äôs recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn‚Äôt, where it ends up and who‚Äôs paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn‚Äôt always straightforward. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really hard to identify what kind of material it is,‚Äù says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. ‚ÄúIf the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it‚Äôs covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,‚Äù he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it‚Äôs vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies ‚Äì essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‚ÄòThe objective is to increase farmer incomes‚Äô: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer‚Äôs bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. ‚ÄúThis means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,‚Äù says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it‚Äôs a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. ‚ÄúIt makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today‚Äôs problems in sorting and recycling packaging,‚Äù says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. ‚Äú[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.‚Äù

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product‚Äôs website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. ‚ÄúMaybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],‚Äù he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. ‚ÄúWe are in a very early pioneering phase,‚Äù he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. ‚ÄúEven with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.‚Äù

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold‚Äôs mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. ‚ÄúIt brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,‚Äù he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. ‚ÄúThis means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.‚Äù

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this testing to the next level.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. ‚ÄúI think it was my children,‚Äù he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. ‚ÄúAs they‚Äôve gotten older, they‚Äôve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.‚Äù

In the salon‚Äôs new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There‚Äôs a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He‚Äôs also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he‚Äôs already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there‚Äôs been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs added a real buzz to the salon,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú[Clients] feel they‚Äôre doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what‚Äôs going on [in the world].‚Äù

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. ‚ÄúA big turning point was David Attenborough‚Äôs The Blue Planet,‚Äù she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. ‚ÄúI had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green.‚Äô‚Äù

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than ¬£5,000 a year. ‚ÄúThere are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we‚Äôve found a lot of win-wins,‚Äù Baden says. ‚Äú[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients‚Äô behaviour. They‚Äôre connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.‚Äù

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai G√∂rlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel‚Äôs brands. ‚ÄúWe truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,‚Äù he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, G√∂rlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf‚Äôs Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children‚Äôs Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. ‚ÄúHairdressing is a skill, a craft ‚Äì it‚Äôs teachable,‚Äù Ellis says. ‚ÄúSo we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.‚Äù Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. ‚ÄúShe ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed my life.‚Äô It‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. ‚ÄúI felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.‚Äù Many will go on to set up their own businesses ‚Äì Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‚ÄúHe said that it‚Äôs such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,‚Äù G√∂rlitz says of Son. ‚ÄúIn 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.‚Äù And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, G√∂rlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel‚Äôs Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. ‚ÄúShaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.‚Äù

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he‚Äôs felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever, we‚Äôve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That‚Äôs incredible. There‚Äôs been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
651,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue ‚Äì its stickiness ‚Äì is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 ‚Äì the 2020 target is 60% ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind‚Äôs environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: ‚ÄúThe issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.‚Äù

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It‚Äôs things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes ‚Äì generally, anything that doesn‚Äôt spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. ‚ÄúIt costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn‚Äôt collect and sort it,‚Äù he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex‚Äôs goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK‚Äôs circular economy package ‚Äì an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value ‚Äì will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It‚Äôs all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we‚Äôll see a change for flexible packaging then. ‚ÄúWhen the EPR system is launched in 2023, we‚Äôre hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,‚Äù he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won‚Äôt be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time ‚Äì let‚Äôs say cardboard ‚Äì and also for plastics,‚Äù says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel‚Äôs projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. ‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?‚Äô He said he‚Äôd worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!‚Äù

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer ‚Äì often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec‚Äôs technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. ‚ÄúThe debonding allows you to recover more [materials],‚Äù Bankmann says. ‚ÄúIt will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.‚Äù

The adhesives developed with Saperatec‚Äôs recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel‚Äôs RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. ‚ÄúAs the targets go up and we‚Äôre increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,‚Äù he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
652,17 delicious loaf tin recipes (that aren‚Äôt banana bread),[],"A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost ¬£2 ‚Äì even the cheapest model will set you back about ¬£2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough ‚Äì about 900g.

So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity ‚Äì any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin ‚Äì some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner‚Äôs lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin ‚Äì and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.

A good place to start is plain old bread ‚Äì specifically, Dan Lepard‚Äôs sour cream sandwich loaf. While it is possible to knock up endless free-form, rustic loaves at home, the point of the tin is to make bread that in some way resembles the stuff you buy in a shop: sharp-cornered, sandwich friendly, toaster ready. Lepard‚Äôs method relies on a quick knead ‚Äì about 10 seconds ‚Äì repeated at 10 minute intervals, plus a final rise in the tin. In this, and in every recipe here, you would be wise first to line your tin with greaseproof paper, even if the loaf tin in question is non-stick. If you like living dangerously, feel free to ignore this warning and accept the consequences.

Claire Thomson‚Äôs porridge bread makes good use of leftover cold porridge, mixed in with the white flour. For a darker, gluten-free bread, Lepard offers multiseed and molasses bread. Besides molasses (or black treacle), the recipe requires a mix of potato starch, cornflour, rice flour, psyllium husk, egg white and a selection of seeds. But because there is no gluten, there is no need to knead: you end up with a sort of batter that firms itself up as it rises.

Loaf tins are not just for bread ‚Äì you can also use them to make loaf-shaped cakes, a pound cake being one of the best and simplest. Traditionally, pound cake contained a pound of each of the four main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs), but you don‚Äôt need a maths degree to realise that this would overwhelm a 2lb tin. Instead, try this recipe for vanilla pound cake, which calls for 200g of each (that means three eggs), along with a teaspoon of untraditional, but wholly welcome, baking powder.

Drizzle cake is another loaf tin standard. Felicity Cloake‚Äôs perfect version is a close relative to pound cake, with some ground almonds and lemon zest thrown in and, of course, the drizzle. Fergus Henderson‚Äôs seed cake, meanwhile, is one of the few dedicated elevenses recipes out there, best administered with a glass of something while lunch is still a distant prospect. The seed in question is caraway; the something should be madeira.

Rachel Roddy‚Äôs marmalade cake is yet another variation ‚Äì the proportions are the same as for pound cake, although the amounts here suggest a 1lb loaf tin may be a more suitable size. Tamal Ray‚Äôs blood orange syrup loaf is a gluten-free option, using polenta instead of flour. In an emergency, you could profitably employ regular oranges.

Ruby Tandoh‚Äôs blueberry loaf cake is made with yoghurt and almond oil (although she says sunflower oil, with a little added vanilla, works as a substitute). Delia Smith has a recipe for dark Jamaican gingerbread that will allow you to get more use out of that tin of black treacle or molasses you bought to make Lepard‚Äôs bread.

Your loaf tin can also serve as a mould for savoury dishes, most famously meatloaf. There are countless wildly different variations on this classic American dish and I have hit on a few bad ones while trying to recreate the kind my mother made. As ever, it is wisest to rely on Cloake‚Äôs definitive version: after some experimentation, she settles on a recipe containing, among other things, spinach, yoghurt, eggs, garlic, brown sugar and ketchup. If you are looking for something elementary ‚Äì and very much in the humble, no-nonsense spirit of the dish ‚Äì you could have a go at this five-ingredient meatloaf: mince, bacon, sage-and-onion stuffing mix, a beef stock cube and sunflower oil. If you don‚Äôt like the sound of that list, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt like meatloaf.

As far as I am concerned, a terrine tin and a loaf tin are the same thing ‚Äì if you have one, you have both. This means that as soon as you have turned out your bread you can use the tin to whip up a pat√© de campagne. Once again, I am passing on Cloake‚Äôs hard-won expertise, alongside a warning that this will amount to rather more than a lazy afternoon‚Äôs work. Plus, you may have to source some caul fat. Another option is this festive-sounding duck and pork terrine with cranberries and pistachios, which has the advantage of being rather easier to pull together.

A terrine need not be a savoury dish ‚Äì your loaf tin can give shape to all sorts of desserts and puddings. This coffee ice-cream terrine, for example, is made up of layers of coffee and vanilla ice-cream, cemented together with chocolate sauce and left to set hard in the freezer.

Chocolate caramel terrine is another layered pudding ‚Äì this time a caramel, mascarpone, chocolate and cream mixture interspersed with caramel wafers cut to fit your loaf tin. More impressive still is Liam Charles‚Äôs rhubarb and honey panna cotta terrine: a blondie biscuit base with rhubarb jelly on top and panna cotta in between. If you feel uncomfortable making something like that in the same loaf tin you used for meatloaf last week, then I am with you.

653,How to make cullen skink ‚Äì recipe,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there‚Äôs anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it‚Äôs the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it‚Äôs too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked ‚Äì to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it‚Äôs not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool ‚Äì take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums ‚Ä¶

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 ‚Ä¶ and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them unless they‚Äôre very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice ‚Äì small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink ‚Äì white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury‚Ä¶

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns ‚Äì steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself ‚Äì making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

‚ÄúI started to get those feelings last week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible uneasiness. There‚Äôs this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there‚Äôs a feeling of complete hopelessness.‚Äù There are physical sensations, too ‚Äì her heart races, and she feels hot. ‚ÄúAnd just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.‚Äù Although it‚Äôs tough to experience, it is, she says, ‚Äúa godsend that I know what‚Äôs happening now‚Äù.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, ‚Äúthe usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out‚Äù. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious‚Äù.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we‚Äôre not around the people who might spot something is off ‚Äì our family, friends or colleagues ‚Äì and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

‚ÄòIf you are feeling very sad, you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment.‚Äô Photograph: LaylaBird/Getty Images

‚ÄúFor instance, if you are feeling very sad,‚Äù says Robinson, ‚Äúyou would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you‚Äôre not looking forward to anything in the future. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.‚Äù Instead, says Robinson, ‚Äúask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to‚Äù.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. ‚ÄúNormally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut everyone‚Äôs finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can‚Äôt concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?‚Äù

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we‚Äôre living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? ‚ÄúSo ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?‚Äù Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. ‚ÄúSo the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself ‚Äì and in a limited, more muted way than previously ‚Äì am I still able to motivate myself to see people?‚Äù

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. ‚ÄúAgain, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that‚Äôs a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúBut if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can‚Äôt get things done that need to get done, you can‚Äôt get the shopping in, you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat or you‚Äôre overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can‚Äôt function, these would be warning signs to seek help.‚Äù

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you‚Äôre being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and ‚Äúwhether people find that they‚Äôre excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That‚Äôs a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.‚Äù

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there‚Äôs a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.‚Äù

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about ‚Äúthriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there‚Äôs that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There‚Äôs more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there‚Äôs an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.‚Äù

The core symptoms of depression, he says, ‚Äúare a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that there‚Äôs definitely a mental health condition.‚Äù It‚Äôs when it becomes pervasive and has an ‚Äúimpact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we‚Äôre becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.‚Äù However, he points out, ‚Äúeverybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what‚Äôs normal for you?‚Äù

‚ÄòI found I wasn‚Äôt reading, and I thought: ‚ÄúThis is very odd.‚Äù‚Äô Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images (Posed by model)

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, ‚ÄúI found that suddenly I wasn‚Äôt reading and I thought: ‚ÄòThis is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?‚Äô I‚Äôd start and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a book.‚Äù A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the guitar since lockdown. It‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, but I can‚Äôt kind of get around to doing it.‚Äù During low periods, ‚ÄúI tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I‚Äôll find excuses why I can‚Äôt see them. So I know that I‚Äôve got to force myself to do something.‚Äù Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people ‚Äúand just be silly‚Äù, but obviously it hasn‚Äôt been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it‚Äôs not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise ‚Äì particularly walking ‚Äì works for her, ‚Äúand cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve failed again, you‚Äôre going back to where you were.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like: ‚ÄòNo, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.‚Äù She would seek help, she says, ‚Äúif it got to the point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage it myself‚Äù.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. ‚ÄúThe charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.‚Äù There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. ‚ÄúI would emphasise that it‚Äôs been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,‚Äù says Obuaya. ‚ÄúTherefore we shouldn‚Äôt make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they‚Äôve got a major mental health problem.‚Äù But, he stresses, there is ‚Äúa range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111. In the US, Mental Health America is available on 800-273-8255. In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978

",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
655,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you‚Äôve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It‚Äôs most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, ‚Äúlife‚Äù is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I‚Äôve been targeted with ads for ‚Äúface yoga‚Äù, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize ‚Äì $25

Who doesn‚Äôt want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 ‚Äúreps‚Äù a day for 30 days. The beginners‚Äô version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you‚Äôve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a ‚ÄúChad‚Äù ‚Äì a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix ‚Äì $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No ‚Äì she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night‚Äôs sleep.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don‚Äôt suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn‚Äôt stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn‚Äôt to say such strips can‚Äôt be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don‚Äôt think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.‚Äù Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it‚Äôs no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it‚Äôs probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good ‚Äì the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you‚Äôve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

‚ÄúMy first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it‚Äôs not too expensive, it‚Äôs very reasonable to try.‚Äù

So can they work? ‚ÄúIn terms of its actual efficacy it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúReally, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.‚Äù However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth a shot‚Äù.

Upright Go 2 ‚Äì $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you‚Äôve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They‚Äôre right, of course, but it‚Äôs also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you‚Äôve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can‚Äôt roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I‚Äôd recommend it the most.

Manly app ‚Äì $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It‚Äôs simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly‚Äôs suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it‚Äôs been stuffed full of sausages.

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they‚Äôve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are. Meanwhile the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I‚Äôm quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you‚Äôre one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre ‚Äì like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people‚Äôs body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we‚Äôre all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it‚Äôs editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it‚Äôs something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
656,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an ‚Äúexclusively English environment‚Äù.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: ‚ÄúAmongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting ‚Ä¶ and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‚Äòcultural habit‚Äô of visiting ‚Ä¶ There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.‚Äù

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show‚Äôs presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country ‚Äì regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland‚Äôs peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

‚ÄúI found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit ‚Äì I imagine it was all three ‚Äì but it was tough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained ‚Ä¶ but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.‚Äù

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

‚ÄúI realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I‚Äôd come back feeling refreshed ‚Äì ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.‚Äù

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

‚ÄúPeople look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it‚Äôs consistently pointed out to you that you don‚Äôt fit in, or when you don‚Äôt see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn‚Äôt be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.‚Äù

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

‚ÄúPosting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it‚Äôs not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.‚Äù

Rhiane Fatinikun, 33, Bolton: founder of Black Girls Hike

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go ‚Äì her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and ‚Äúdoing something really physical‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,‚Äù she said.

I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

‚ÄúI needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn‚Äôt just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.‚Äù

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

‚ÄúMany people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside ‚Äì the last bastions of whiteness ‚Äì where it is even less diverse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.‚Äù

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton ‚Äì one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

‚ÄúThere are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.‚Äù

Omie Dale, 23, south London: Black Swimming Association; Pride in Water volunteer

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in ‚Äúgrubby holiday homes‚Äù, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn‚Äôt and so it was kind of non-negotiable ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake ‚Äì we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSometimes I didn‚Äôt even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.‚Äù

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

‚ÄúWith swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you‚Äôve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents ‚Äì all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

‚ÄúThere are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
657,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a ‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is ‚Äútrust‚Äù. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life ‚Äì finances, work, household, even grooming ‚Äì so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that ‚Äúagreement‚Äù would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would ‚Äì how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent ‚Äì including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established ‚Äúswingers‚Äù community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

659,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a ‚Äúfertility specialist‚Äù in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City‚Äôs first women‚Äôs hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband‚Äôs sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm‚Äôs daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff‚Äôs office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn‚Äôt heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada‚Äôs doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families ‚Äì 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor‚Äôs treatments ‚Äì shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, ‚Äúthe idea of closure is really impossible,‚Äù Hannah Olson, the film‚Äôs director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how ‚Äúpainful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence‚Äù.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records ‚Äì birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives ‚Äì sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora‚Äôs box of secrets. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn‚Äôt the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn‚Äôt the person they thought he was,‚Äù she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized ‚Äì ‚Äúthis was a phenomenon.‚Äù

Baby God initially follows Babst‚Äôs personal investigation, as she retraces her mother‚Äôs steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier‚Äôs former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality ‚Äì a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable ‚Äì has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier‚Äôs previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. ‚ÄúI feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn‚Äôt violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,‚Äù he says in the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still struggling with that. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up.‚Äù

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. ‚ÄúAt first it was like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get all the facts, we‚Äôre going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,‚Äô‚Äù said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction ‚Äì one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier ‚Äì make the doctor‚Äôs deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù attitude, belief that women don‚Äôt need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn‚Äôt become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, ‚Äúwe ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,‚Äù said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film‚Äôs second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier‚Äôs two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline‚Äôs descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case‚Äôs larger, more unsettling questions. ‚ÄúLooking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it‚Äôs always been illegal. It‚Äôs battery, it‚Äôs malpractice, you can‚Äôt put something in someone‚Äôs body without their consent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTowards the end, it became about making peace with one‚Äôs parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?‚Äù The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a ‚Äúvery bizarre case‚Äù to ‚Äúilluminate something that may be universal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just trying to make peace with our parents.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
660,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It‚Äôs the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It‚Äôs now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it‚Äôs honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It‚Äôs a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum‚Äôs executive director.

‚ÄúEven though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,‚Äù said Horsford. ‚ÄúIt can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.‚Äù

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. ‚ÄúThey think, oh we‚Äôre in the north, that wasn‚Äôt an issue here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it‚Äôs a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.‚Äù

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. ‚ÄúPeople who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don‚Äôt say much more,‚Äù she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it‚Äôs a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

‚ÄúWe wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we‚Äôre talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,‚Äù adds Horsford. ‚ÄúWe never want to say: ‚Äòthese people were just slaves,‚Äô because there‚Äôs so much to the story than just that.‚Äù

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm‚Äôs former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

‚ÄúI wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today‚Äôs generations, are human,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.‚Äù

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

‚ÄúWe must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúNot just select people.‚Äù

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the ‚Äúfront parlor‚Äù, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information ‚Äúrelating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room‚Äù, said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúThese images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.‚Äù

Sydlowski‚Äôs work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, ‚Äúcreated specifically for those who were enslaved‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.‚Äù

It captures an ongoing battle. ‚ÄúNew York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,‚Äù said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúMy installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.‚Äù

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúHighlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,‚Äù said Prevost.

‚ÄúToday, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúFollowing our recent election, we‚Äôve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
661,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn‚Äôt know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry‚Äôs book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we‚Äôve diligently followed Barry‚Äôs class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute ‚Äúattendance card‚Äù, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I‚Äôve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

During the pandemic, many activities I love (eating out, visiting friends) are forbidden. I‚Äôm often too anxious to read for any length of time, and writing‚Äôs a challenge. With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn‚Äôt believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn‚Äôt bear to give away. It‚Äôs meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work ‚Äì writing, reporting, teaching ‚Äì I never worry if I‚Äôm doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we‚Äôve exhausted Lynda Barry‚Äôs attendance cards. Now we‚Äôve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity‚Äôs sake, and it‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that‚Äôs unpredictable ‚Äì will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? ‚Äì it feels good to let go of the ‚Äúperfect drawing‚Äù and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who‚Äôd burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I‚Äôd no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn‚Äôt quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I‚Äôm a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I‚Äôm floating in outer space, miles above Earth‚Äôs problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

662,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' ‚Äì the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. ‚ÄúIt seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn‚Äôt believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?‚Äù says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee‚Äôs Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called ‚Äúblack vernacular art‚Äù. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was ‚Äúgoing to change art history‚Äù. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with ‚Äúsongs of sorrow‚Äù from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion ‚Äì quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. ‚ÄúThat the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,‚Äù said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett‚Äôs son, Matt. ‚ÄúThe rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.‚Äù

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett ‚Äì like all the quilters ‚Äì was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt ‚Äì a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 ‚Äì now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters‚Äô work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee‚Äôs Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours ‚Äì typical of the period ‚Äì make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie‚Äôs daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a ‚Äúblock style‚Äù that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. ‚ÄúAs a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they‚Äôd let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,‚Äù she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, ‚Äúbut it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.‚Äù It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee‚Äôs Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw ‚Äì now director of Texas Southern University Museum ‚Äì captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created ‚Äúbetween picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband ‚Ä¶ [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.‚Äù

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts ‚Äì like Qunnie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHousetop‚Äù ‚Äì after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. ‚ÄúNormally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,‚Äù says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. ‚ÄúI do believe that the intentions were good, but I don‚Äôt think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,‚Äù she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It‚Äôs not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren‚Äôt many quilters among the younger generations, she says ‚Äì at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, ‚Äúbut our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
663,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano‚Äôs 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier‚Äôs pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,‚Äù Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado‚Äôs Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

‚ÄúThis is some of the worst work in the world,‚Äù said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park‚Äôs rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement ‚Äì and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers‚Äô lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill‚Äôs toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel‚Äôs Landing in Utah‚Äôs Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

‚ÄúIf I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out ‚Ä¶ and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,‚Äù Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill‚Äôs toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren‚Äôt cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they‚Äôre not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag ‚Äì often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell ‚Äì or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah‚Äôs Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won‚Äôt degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

‚ÄúPeople are really opening up to the idea,‚Äù Henry said.

Plastic bags aren‚Äôt a perfect fix ‚Äì they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don‚Äôt want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don‚Äôt have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

‚ÄúOnce you get eight miles into the backcountry, it‚Äôs up to you to dig a hole,‚Äù Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
664,Cabaret's Joel Grey: 'Life is tough. But it's also beautiful',[],"‚ÄúShame on you! How could you bring that up? You wanna see a grown man cry?‚Äù Joel Grey is berating me on Zoom. All I wanted to know was how he got the nickname Mr Porno when filming his role as the Emcee, the smirking ringleader he created on Broadway in Kander and Ebb‚Äôs Weimar musical Cabaret. Mercifully, he is teasing me.

It‚Äôs not for the first time in our chat. There is a glint in his eye when he impersonates a ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy, breaks into a snippet of Sixteen Going on Seventeen from The Sound of Music (he once auditioned to play Rolf) and punctuates answers with a high-pitched exhalation that sounds like air escaping from a balloon. When he asks if I want to go to the Oscars I half-believe he‚Äôll take me. His party piece turns out to be an impression of Diana Ross, who handed him his statuette for best supporting actor for Cabaret at the Academy Awards in 1973. ‚ÄúListen to this,‚Äù he says, coming closer to the screen. ‚ÄúAnd the Oscar goes to,‚Äù he half-whispers in a breathy, suspenseful sigh. ‚ÄúJoel ‚Ä¶ Grey!‚Äù

Grey is 88 going on 18. In a pale pink shirt and clear frame glasses, he pops up not with the Emcee‚Äôs willkommen or bienvenue but a perky ‚ÄúHiya! How are ya?‚Äù He is in the office of his New York loft apartment, overlooking Hudson River park. The Oscar can be glimpsed in profile on the windowsill, alongside a Tony award for Cabaret. I‚Äôve already taken a virtual tour of his loft ‚Äì where his own photographs hang among artworks by Robert Rauschenberg and Duane Michals ‚Äì as it was featured in an interior design video online. I compliment him on his airy bathroom where a giant photograph of Machu Picchu hangs next to a monolithic tub. ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre not going in there today,‚Äù he replies briskly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good place for an interview.‚Äù

He has spent the morning making french toast and compiling a personal scrapbook of old pictures. It may be the next in his series of photography books, which have included a volume of vibrant closeup portraits of flowers. One of his lockdown hobbies is buying blooms at a nearby shop, then spending hours ‚Äúpulling them apart and looking deep inside‚Äù. He disappears to fetch a large print of purple petals and holds it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a face,‚Äù he says from behind the photograph. ‚ÄúA scary, beautiful thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs true: the flower resembles a glowing skull, somehow both richly flamboyant and ethereal. The picture remains held up, filling the screen. There is a silence. Do I talk to the flower? ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Grey chuckles from behind it.

With Broadway‚Äôs theatres closed by the pandemic, what has Grey been doing for entertainment? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at TikTok,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that? Everybody is doing it. My grandchild is doing it. And I don‚Äôt know what it is!‚Äù Has he been going out much? ‚ÄúLess and less. I live across the street from the river and there‚Äôs a beautiful park. When we go there, it‚Äôs jammed with people ‚Äì with masks mostly, but I get nervous.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot to fit into Grey‚Äôs scrapbook. He has been acting for almost 80 years. His professional debut, aged nine, was in his home town of Cleveland in On Borrowed Time, a macabre comedy about death. The experience ‚Äúgrabbed my throat and held me to the fire‚Äù, he remembers. ‚ÄúI knew I was an actor.‚Äù It resonated so strongly that he staged a revival of On Borrowed Time a few years ago and, this year, directed a Zoom reading of it. He has returned to Cabaret, too, reprising the Emcee on stage in the 80s. It will always be his most famous role, but there have been many others on Broadway: as the showman George M Cohan (in George M!, the closure of which was blamed on Richard Nixon visiting backstage); the Wizard of Oz in the hit Wicked; luckless ‚ÄúMr Cellophane‚Äù Amos Hart in Chicago, also from Kander and Ebb; and most recently, wistful servant Firs in The Cherry Orchard in 2016.

A year earlier, Grey made headlines when he came out in People magazine at the age of 82. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like labels,‚Äù he told his interviewer, ‚Äúbut if you have to put a label on it, I‚Äôm a gay man.‚Äù It had taken time, he said, to ‚Äúembrace that other part of who I always was‚Äù. In his 2016 memoir, Master of Ceremonies, he wrote about how, since his youth, he had felt forced to hide his sexuality. Grey detailed early relationships, including with a bellboy at the residential hotel where his family lived in an apartment, and described a permanent hyper-alertness about being ‚Äúsmall, sissy, Jewish‚Äù. It is frequently a painful read: his mother is disgusted when he comes out to her as a teenager by telling her about a threesome he had with a cantor from their temple. When he tells his wife, Jo Wilder, about his past gay experiences it deepens a void between them that ends their 24-year marriage in the early 80s. Their children are the actor Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing) and James, a chef. Grey describes how important it was for them both to see him play a gay man on stage, in Larry Kramer‚Äôs landmark Aids drama The Normal Heart, to better understand their father.

One of Grey‚Äôs first film roles (as a smirking law student in Come September in 1961) was opposite Rock Hudson, who was leading his own double life as a gay man in Hollywood. Grey remembers him as ‚Äúa really nice, funny guy‚Äù. When Hudson died of complications from Aids in 1985, it increased awareness of an epidemic that for many was ‚Äútoo horrible to accept or think through‚Äù, Grey says. Denial and misinformation were rife. One scene in The Normal Heart required him to kiss another man. ‚ÄúA friend of mine said, you ought to find out from a doctor whether or not you are putting yourself at risk,‚Äù remembers Grey. ‚ÄúI called this doctor who was taking care of Rock Hudson. He said: ‚ÄòDo you have to kiss the actor?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòYeah, it‚Äôs important in the script.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòThen I wouldn‚Äôt do the play.‚Äô‚Äù Grey wrestled with it and chose the play and the kiss. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI need to tell this story. As an actor it‚Äôs my job.‚Äô And it‚Äôs what I live for.‚Äù He remembers Kramer, who died this year, as a ‚Äútough audience‚Äù, but ‚Äúvery supportive of my work‚Äù.

It is theatre, rather than film or TV, that has been Grey‚Äôs passion since his childhood debut. Back then he was Joel Katz. His grandparents were eastern European Jews who settled in Cleveland. Joel was the first of two sons born to Mickey, a musician and comedian who found fame with his Jewish revue the Borscht Capades, and Grace, who named him after her favourite actor, Joel McCrea, and hungered for him to become famous.

A pair of contrasting scenes in Grey‚Äôs memoir find him alone as a boy. In one, his mother takes him to New York for an audition that never materialises, and leaves him scared in their hotel room when she goes out with a man. In the other, he is accidentally abandoned in the theatre after hours but is unafraid and revels in its backstage magic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want anybody to come and get me,‚Äù he tells me.

At nine, Grey craved a serious theatre career. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I cared about.‚Äù But after appearing in his dad‚Äôs revue, he became a nightclub performer and was spotted by the entertainer Eddie Cantor who gave him a spot on his TV show in 1951 when Grey was 18. His whirlwind routine is on YouTube: wide-eyed and elfin-featured, Grey cracks jokes, barks like a seal, does the charleston and dances like a dream. It‚Äôs a five-minute delight but the result, he says, was that ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get any parts in plays. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòOh no, he‚Äôs a TV guy‚Äô or ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a nightclub guy.‚Äô It kind of got in the way of my legitimacy.‚Äù His nightclub years included playing the London Palladium on a bill with Johnnie Ray, whose more fervent admirers threw Ray their underwear. ‚ÄúSometimes they forgot to clear the stage,‚Äù recalls Grey, who then had to dance a path between the knickers.

He was considering giving up acting when Cabaret came along. Where would he have gone? ‚ÄúAn art gallery,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúOr a hotdog stand.‚Äù The impish Emcee was the first theatre role he was offered without an audition. The songs may have been great but when he first read the script, he was alarmed that he had no dialogue and no direct involvement with the plot. The role was essentially a metaphor for seduction and corruption. ‚ÄúI was worried that it was one-dimensional, that he was a nightclub performer doing numbers.‚Äù That was precisely what Grey had been trying to escape. ‚ÄúI had to find out the psychology [of the Emcee] and who he was off stage so that hopefully I could bring that biography into those numbers.‚Äù

Six-year-old Jennifer would accompany him to the theatre, watching from the wings and even getting made up as one of the Kit Kat Girls in the seedy club. Elements of the Emcee‚Äôs look, notably the neatly combed hair and the bow tie, mirrored how Grey‚Äôs mother had dressed him as a child. Some of the makeup he used was his wife‚Äôs. His co-star Lotte Lenya ‚Äì celebrated chanteuse, ex-wife of Kurt Weill, and James Bond‚Äôs nemesis Rosa Klebb ‚Äì helped him with the German accent. Jill Haworth was Sally Bowles, the club dancer who longs for a gig at a respectable film studio ‚Äì surely a feeling Grey could relate to.

What made Cabaret so groundbreaking? ‚ÄúFirst of all, it was about a heinous and terrifying subject: the Holocaust. There were a lot of people who just wanted to forget about it. They tried to write it out of textbooks.‚Äù The musical‚Äôs unflinching account of antisemitism and persecution remains horribly current, much like Fiddler on the Roof, which Grey recently directed in a Yiddish version at New York‚Äôs Museum of Jewish Heritage. In the years immediately after the second world war, Mickey Katz had had hits with Yiddish parodies of popular songs (Haim Afen Range, for example, after Home on the Range). His father was, Grey wrote proudly in his memoir, ‚Äúinserting Jews into pop culture, so that we belonged, too‚Äù.

Grey says he and the producer-director, Hal Prince, were in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù creating Cabaret together on Broadway. But when Bob Fosse came to direct the film version he did not want to inherit Grey‚Äôs Emcee. ‚ÄúThere was a total standoff.‚Äù It was Fosse who called him Mr Porno, but Grey insists: ‚ÄúHe was the original Mr Porno! He was in burlesque backstage when he was a teenager. He saw all that bizarreness as a kid and was attracted to it.‚Äù Grey came to believe that Fosse‚Äôs animosity towards him was because he wanted to play the Emcee himself. ‚ÄúHe was an excellent performer,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúHe could have done it.‚Äù

At the Oscars, Grey beat three actors from The Godfather ‚Äì James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino ‚Äì and The Heartbreak Kid‚Äôs Eddie Albert. I imagine the Godfather mob glowering at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve forgiven me!‚Äù he laughs.

Cabaret matched its Tony awards tally of eight wins ‚Äì including best director for Fosse and best actress for Liza Minnelli. When Grey‚Äôs name was read out at the Oscars ceremony, there was Minnelli behind him, dressed in canary yellow, rocking wildly with delight. She was a great choice to play Bowles, he thinks, and her own irresistible sense of fun came with a vulnerability, too. Minnelli would fall asleep on his shoulder on the early morning taxi drives from the hotel to the set. The pair went on to launch a nightclub act in Vegas that they toured around the US. One night, she introduced him on stage before he was ready but he strolled on trouser-less regardless. They performed separately and together, with a set list including Cabaret songs.

Decades later, people are still quoting the Emcee to him. Is it an albatross in any way? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù He advances to the screen. ‚ÄúLet me come closer to you: just ‚Ä¶ great!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only boundary-breaking musical he has worked on. Grey has a small but joyous scene in Lars von Trier‚Äôs Dancer in the Dark, tap-dancing in a courtroom with Bj√∂rk. That looked like fun, I suggest. ‚ÄúWrong,‚Äù he barks back. ‚ÄúHard! The two of them [Bj√∂rk and Von Trier] were not connecting. [We] were in the midst of doing something very unique, and the star and the director weren‚Äôt talking.‚Äù

We‚Äôve rambled way beyond our allotted time and Grey has his scrapbook and his art to attend to. But he starts another story about visiting Cleveland‚Äôs art museum as a kid, finding rooms to hide in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be in the Egyptian place getting into one of those sarcophaguses. I had this idea that I could hide in one of them.‚Äù His high-pitch exhale comes back, this time turning into a full ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù I wonder what he would say to nine-year-old Joel Katz, messing around in museums and embarking on his first stage role back in Cleveland. He replies: ‚ÄúStick with it, be who you are. It‚Äôs going to be tough.‚Äù There‚Äôs a beat. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also going to be beautiful.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

676,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire ‚Äì photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria‚Äôs 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: ‚ÄúWalking through the remains of Europe‚Äôs biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.‚Äù

A Valentine‚Äôs Day mug. Valentine‚Äôs Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

‚ÄúBetween the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone‚Äôs home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.‚Äù

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

‚ÄúThe owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.‚Äù

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

‚ÄúThis is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.‚Äù

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child‚Äôs shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

England‚Äôs new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The ‚Äúrule of six‚Äù will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm ‚Äì with last orders at 10pm ‚Äì only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas ‚Äì from 23 December to 27 December ‚Äì there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

682,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London‚Äôs Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: ‚ÄúWithout the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

‚ÄúPolice took a measured response. You, however, didn‚Äôt engage with police ‚Äì police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.‚Äù

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge ‚Äì meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment ‚Äì after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park‚Äôs Speakers‚Äô Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by ‚Äúaddressing the gathering and encouraging ‚Ä¶ others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,‚Äù the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a ‚Äúlight-touch policing‚Äù approach by encouraging the gatherings to ‚Äúdisperse without the necessity for enforcement action‚Äù.

But Corbyn, he added, had ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù participated in the gathering ‚Äúby way of making public addresses‚Äù and that he allegedly ‚Äúdisregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period‚Äù.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 ‚Äúis not a pandemic‚Äù and argue that ‚Äúif it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us‚Äù.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: ‚ÄúThis case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers‚Äô Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

‚ÄúMr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.‚Äù

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A ‚Äúblanket ban‚Äù on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a tremendous result.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
683,'It's lovely to be back': on the streets of three-tier England as lockdown lifts,[],"England‚Äôs second national lockdown lifted on Wednesday, with 99% of the population placed under the second and third tiers of a three-tier regime. However, non-essential shops are allowed to open under every tier, giving shop owners hope for a much-needed high street boost ahead of Christmas. The Guardian went out on Wednesday to take the mood across the different zones.

Tier 1: St Ives

The Three Ferrets pub in the Cornish harbour-side town of St Ives was buzzing with chatter and laughter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lovely to be back,‚Äù said Richard Cockling, 83, a retired merchant seaman and fisherman as he sipped on a celebratory gin and tonic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed this place. The latest lockdown has been the worst ‚Äì long and boring. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back into this place.‚Äù

Keith Tickner, 59, a cleaner, settled down in his usual cosy spot in front of the blazing fire with a group of friends. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how much you miss your mates and your routine until you‚Äôre allowed back,‚Äù he said.

St Ives, a long-beloved retreat for artists, beach lovers and surfers, was recently judged the happiest place to live in the UK. On the day it and the rest of Cornwall became the only area in mainland England to begin life in tier 1 it felt a jolly town to be in.

From first light, the town was packed with delivery lorries restocking the shops, cafes and restaurants. Bleary-eyed kitchen staff emerged from furlough to begin prepping for dinner time while shopkeepers polished windows and scrubbed floors.

‚ÄúLook at that cobweb,‚Äù said Paul Clegg, a potter who specialises in lucky Cornish piskies, his take on the leprechaun, as he buffed his windows. ‚ÄúThis is the best place in the country anyway. So many people who live here came on holiday, then just decided to stay because it‚Äôs so nice. But it does feel a particularly good day today.‚Äù

Opposite, Sarah Allen was putting up Christmas lights outside her cafe, Sky‚Äôs Diner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù She expected to be busy. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get visitors coming from all over the country who want a taste of life in tier 1,‚Äù she said.

Cornwall council‚Äôs leader, Julian German, called it a ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù for the county but asked people not to drop their guard. ‚ÄúCovid doesn‚Äôt care what tier we‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòWe live in a bit of a bubble here‚Äô: Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor shop. Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian

The advantages of living in tier 1 include being allowed to have a drink in a pub without a meal and to meet in a group of up to six indoors as well as outside.

People from tier 3 areas have been urged by the council not to visit Cornwall and the police this week revealed that up to 10 extra cars would be patrolling Devon and Cornwall to deal with Covid rule-breakers.

The council said people from tier 2 areas should bring the restrictions they are subject to at home with them ‚Äúlike hand luggage‚Äù. For example, those in tier 2, should have a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù with their pub drink.

Of course, enforcing such rules are difficult. The Pilchard Press, a real ale pub tucked up an alley near the harbour, was taking no chances. It had fixed a notice to its railings reading: ‚ÄúCornwall residents only‚Äù.

At the Golden Lion pub, licensee Matt Squires said he would be politely asking people where they are from if he did not recognise them. ‚ÄúWe plan to keep people from different tiers separate,‚Äù he said. Locals will be able to use the front bar looking on to the street, visitors the back bar.

Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor clothes shop, said that tier 1 living would not change much for many people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the shops but actually we live in a bit of a bubble here, close to nature and the water. It‚Äôs why people like it.‚Äù SM

Tier 2: Liverpool

‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt seem as scared to come out‚Äô: Rob Pritchard, manager at vintage clothes shop Resurrection in Liverpool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

Vans lined up outside the independent shops and restaurants on Liverpool‚Äôs Bold Street in the morning drizzle to deliver stock to eager staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling festive, we‚Äôve got our Christmas music on and our twinkly lights on,‚Äù said Nicki Whatling, a manager at Rennie‚Äôs Arts and Crafts, as picture frames were unloaded into the store.

While the shop has only 23 days to make up the bulk of lost sales over lockdown, she said she was hopeful the business could ‚Äúhave a fairly decent December‚Äù.

As the day wore on, Whatling‚Äôs wishes began to look more likely, with throngs of Christmas shoppers trickling up and down the city‚Äôs streets. At the vintage clothes store Resurrection, where students were sifting through leisurewear and parents were picking out gifts, the director Rob Pritchard said there had ‚Äúbeen a buzz about the place‚Äù in the middle of the day.

Usually, he said, the store would be much quieter in early December after the Black Friday sales weekend, but he predicted the store would continue to be busy throughout this month. ‚ÄúA lot of people are saying they‚Äôre taking the chance to get back into the city again. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that today,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhen we ended the last lockdown some people were still too scared to come out. This time maybe because the infection rates have fallen so much in Liverpool, they don‚Äôt seem as scared to come.‚Äù

Meanwhile, at the pizza restaurant Crust, the manager Antonio Fornaro was grateful the venue had been able to open ahead of Christmas. ‚ÄúWhen they announced it, I had calls from all my colleagues saying, ‚ÄòYes! We‚Äôre going to be able to open‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Throughout England‚Äôs second national lockdown, takeaway sales had dropped off as people reigned in spending, said Fornaro. But on Wednesday afternoon, the reduced tables and chairs in the restaurant were full once again.

Outside the trainer store Size?, university student Adam Macholc, 18, was one of a small socially distanced group of sneakerheads waiting for the latest Adidas drop as staff inside got ready to open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying them for myself,‚Äù he said, adding that despite a turbulent first term, ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a bit more hope‚Äù after the news that the UK had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

In Liverpool‚Äôs main commercial shopping district, around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, other shoppers seemed to be feeling confident too. A queue snaked around the city‚Äôs Primark store, while shoppers trickled in and out of Debenhams to pick up a bargain.

Willing some of them to stop for a substantial meal and a drink on their way home, was the manager of the Doctor Duncan‚Äôs pub, Amy McCarthy. Under tier 2 regulations, a key difference with tier 1 is alcohol cannot be served without food and there must be no multiple household mixing in venues like Doctor Duncan‚Äôs. The pub, located away from the main shopping centre next to Liverpool Lime Street station, had a quiet day with only a handful of customers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next to the bus stops where people usually head to football games and are known for being the first and the last stop. So it‚Äôs different territory for us having to emphasise our pub grub,‚Äù she said. AW

Tier 3: Nottingham

After a month cooped up indoors, shoppers in Nottingham seized the opportunity to return to the city centre on Wednesday.

The east Midlands city is back in tier 3, and is therefore subject to England‚Äôs toughest coronavirus restrictions. Shops, hair salons and gyms have been allowed to reopen, but hospitality venues must offer takeaway or delivery only.

In the city centre, stallholders were preparing for this weekend‚Äôs opening of the Christmas market on Old Market Square, in the heart of the city.

The prime location is overlooked by an imposing six-storey stone building which houses the department store Debenhams, and on the other side of the square is a Dorothy Perkins and a Burton ‚Äì brands that are part of Philip Green‚Äôs Arcadia empire. Both Debenhams and Arcadia are living on borrowed time, having collapsed into administration on consecutive days this week

If Arcadia‚Äôs brands do not find a buyer, Nottingham will feel the impact of store closures keenly. The city is home to nine Arcadia stores ‚Äì .

Tallulah Harries-Pugh, 29, was holding a Topshop carrier bag, but with an item to return rather than a new purchase.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with Sir Philip Green‚Äôs ethics, and I try not to shop [at Arcadia brands],‚Äù said Tallulah. But she said she was worried about the staff, and what more store closures would mean for the high street.

The scars of another recent retail collapse are clearly visible in Nottingham city centre. One of the city‚Äôs two shopping centres, Broadmarsh, was half-demolished with plans under way for a multimillion pound redevelopment, when its owner, the retail property company Intu, collapsed in June.

The city council has been handed the keys to the development and has already spent ¬£19m on the project. Councillor Sam Webster, whose ward covers the city centre, concedes it won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. The project is probably the biggest regeneration in a core city in the country‚Äù.

In the short-term, however, Nottingham‚Äôs businesses have to contend with tier 3 restrictions.

Prof David Paton from Nottingham University business school warns that retailers will feel the impact of cafe, pub and restaurant closures. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of interlinkage between high street hospitality and shops. Nottingham is going to face that, as all tier 3 will.‚Äù

In a normal year the nine stainless steel fermenting vessels at the Castle Rock brewery near the city‚Äôs train station would be full, ahead of the expected peak in demand during the festive season. This December they are empty.

‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas‚Äô: Colin Wilde, MD of Castle Rock brewery in Nottingham. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas,‚Äù said the managing director, Colin Wilde. The brewer and pub operator has 22 sites in Nottingham and across the east Midlands, all in tier 3.

The company now offers takeaway alcohol from its brewery and pubs, but it brings in less than 10% of normal trade, and Wilde said the closed pubs ‚Äúleak cash‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a sector, we feel like canaries in a cage. It feels like politicians are testing things out on the hospitality sector and don‚Äôt think it matters if it dies.‚Äù JP",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
684,No 10 and regulator contradict Hancock's 'because of Brexit' Covid vaccine claim,[],"Both Downing Street and the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator have contradicted a claim by Matt Hancock that Brexit helped the UK become the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus.

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK‚Äôs decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. ‚ÄúWe have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,‚Äù said June Raine, the MHRA‚Äôs chief executive.

Timeline UK Covid-19 restrictions: the key political dates ahead Show Hide Here are some of the key dates ahead for the UK's Covid-19 restrictions. The current lockdown in England ends, and the new strengthened tier system comes into force with nearly 99% of England headed for the strictest two tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day ‚Äì decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs‚Äô approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock‚Äôs stated view, Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

‚ÄúI think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,‚Äù he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it‚Äôs obviously incredibly positive news.‚Äù

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat job of working with the company to look at that data as it‚Äôs come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would‚Äù.

Hancock continued: ‚ÄúThe second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

‚ÄúWe do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they‚Äôre done because of Brexit.‚Äù

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing ‚Äúfast and loose with the facts‚Äù over the vaccine. The party‚Äôs health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim ‚Äúis not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look‚Äù.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock‚Äôs department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA‚Äôs ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as ‚Äúpart of wider conversations‚Äù about the MHRA‚Äôs lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA‚Äôs role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

686,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from Ant√≥nio Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: ‚ÄúHumanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back ‚Äì and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes ‚Ä¶ Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.‚Äù

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) ‚Äì which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible ‚Äì and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

‚ÄúMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,‚Äù he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. ‚ÄúIt must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. ‚ÄúThis is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test ‚Ä¶ We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.‚Äù

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable ‚Äì even in rich countries ‚Äì were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Ni√±a weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: ‚ÄúI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year ‚Äì the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.‚Äù

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to ‚Äúflick the green switch‚Äù while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days‚Äô time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: ‚ÄúWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.‚Äù

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. ‚ÄúNext year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,‚Äù he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. ‚ÄúThere is no vaccine against climate warming,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúBut there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.‚Äù

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

‚ÄúMoney, money, money,‚Äù said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. ‚ÄúThe question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.‚Äù

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK‚Äôs spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host‚Äôs leverage in bringing developing countries together.

‚ÄúA country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
687,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"An alleged ‚Äúbribery for pardon‚Äù scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered ‚Äúa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence‚Äù.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the ‚Äúbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äù, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the ‚Äúsubject or target‚Äù of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. ‚ÄúPardon investigation is Fake News!‚Äù he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‚Äòbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äô is.‚Äù

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro tweeted: ‚ÄúIn 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day ‚Äì but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a ‚Äúpre-emptive pardon‚Äù. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives‚Äô intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt presume ‚Äì and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

‚ÄúIt may be someone that we‚Äôve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.‚Äù

Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said.

‚ÄúI saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,‚Äù Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.‚Äù

Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia‚Äôs prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region‚Äôs ruling party, the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies.

Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents ‚Äì and who was responsible.

On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia‚Äôs government had signed a deal to allow ‚Äúunimpeded‚Äù humanitarian access to Tigray ‚Äì at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people.

Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. ‚ÄúI was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never felt this situation would ever happen.‚Äù



Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba.

Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces.

At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia‚Äôs governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency.

About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted.

Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies.

Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost two crisis on top of each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.‚Äù

Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility.



Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù Tigrayans.

The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes.



Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia.

For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. ‚ÄúIt was very successful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.‚Äù

Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. ‚ÄúBut those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,‚Äù he said.

With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet.

He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we‚Äôre serving 200 patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of drugs every time, so we‚Äôre using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.‚Äù

Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. ‚ÄúRespiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.‚Äù

Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. ‚ÄúWe were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,‚Äù he said.

Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren‚Äôt accessing treatment.

Women‚Äôs reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap.

Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray‚Äôs leadership.

Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias. She accused Abiy of exploiting ethnic divisions and fuelling resentment. ‚ÄúIt is purely ethnic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe country was fair but Abiy wanted all the power. The government made it seem that the problems with Ethiopia were because of Tigray.‚Äù

The rest of her family remains in Tigray. ‚ÄúMy life is there, my family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just waiting to see if things improve.‚Äù

690,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc‚Äôs chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as ‚Äúderisory‚Äù by Downing Street.

On the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

‚ÄúBarnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rush?‚Äô‚Äù said one senior EU diplomat. ‚ÄúAmbassadors for every country bordering the UK ‚Äì 11 all in all ‚Äì raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.‚Äù

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. ‚ÄúThe EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,‚Äù a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in ‚Äúembryo‚Äù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

An EU diplomat said: ‚ÄúWe are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

‚ÄúAs we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.‚Äù

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe‚Äôs coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

He tweeted: ‚ÄúWe are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

691,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain‚Äôs hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,‚Äù he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI want to make sure we‚Äôre going to fight like hell by investing in America first.‚Äù He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America‚Äôs domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden‚Äôs priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his ‚Äúgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China‚Äôs abusive practices ‚Äì that‚Äôs stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations‚Äù and forcing ‚Äútech transfers‚Äù from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. ‚ÄúThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our ‚Äì or at least what used to be our ‚Äì allies on the same page. It‚Äôs going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.‚Äù

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.‚Äù He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal ‚Äúwith the nuclear programme‚Äù.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. ‚ÄúAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,‚Äù he said.

Then, Biden added: ‚ÄúIn consultation with our allies and partners, we‚Äôre going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran‚Äôs nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.‚Äù He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal ‚Äì France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China ‚Äì to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
692,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja‚Äôi Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband‚Äôs aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: ‚ÄúThe procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.‚Äù

The UN said he had been ‚Äúreportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process‚Äù and then ‚Äúforced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras‚Äù.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilm√®s, Belgium‚Äôs deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to ‚Äúdiscuss consular issues‚Äù on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

Wilm√®s also condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last Friday. Iran claimed on Thursday to have identified the individuals responsible for bringing weapons into the country, but gave no details.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
693,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation‚Äôs special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada‚Äôs so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada‚Äôs elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

The Canadian soldiers took horrific ‚Äútrophy‚Äù photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada‚Äôs own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada‚Äôs defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette ‚Äì who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take ‚Äì said that in Canada‚Äôs case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking at the experience that we had, where there were ‚Ä¶ war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn‚Äôt think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it‚Äôs actually worked out.‚Äù

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

‚ÄúIn a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn‚Äôt seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,‚Äù Collenette said.

He said Canada‚Äôs approach ‚Äì disbandment coupled with major organisational reform ‚Äì has been ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù.

No Canadian government ‚Äì conservative or liberal ‚Äì has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

‚ÄúIt was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we‚Äôd fought in world wars, and we‚Äôd never had anything like this.‚Äù

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

‚ÄúEven when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,‚Äù Collenette said. ‚ÄúWe did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it‚Äôs 25 years after the fact.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
694,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has condemned the behaviour of MEP J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Sz√°jer‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúWhat our representative, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,‚Äù said Orb√°n on Wednesday evening. He said Sz√°jer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orb√°n‚Äôs government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Sz√°jer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary‚Äôs constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium‚Äôs coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Sz√°jer‚Äôs resignation. ‚ÄúHe made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,‚Äù it read.

Prior to Orb√°n‚Äôs intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

‚ÄúMr Sz√°jer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,‚Äù said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Sz√°jer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region‚Äôs deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him ‚Äúfleeing along the gutter‚Äù to escape the raid.

Sz√°jer admitted he had been at a ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Sz√°jer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Sz√°jer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. ‚ÄúI always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something ‚Äì just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,‚Äù he said. He added that guests had been ‚Äúcompletely naked‚Äù at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Sz√°jer for possession of drugs. But the ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Sz√°jer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Sz√°jer boasted that he had drafted Hungary‚Äôs new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as ‚Äúa 21st-century constitution‚Äù when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Sz√°jer said: ‚ÄúIt depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don‚Äôt think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.‚Äù

In the intervening decade, Orb√°n‚Äôs government has gone further in its ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orb√°n‚Äôs government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, ‚Äúthe mother is a woman and the father is a man‚Äù. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government‚Äôs justification for the amendment explained that ‚Äúnew, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development‚Äù.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Sz√°jer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making ‚Äúa huge political deal out of a sex scandal‚Äù and praised Sz√°jer‚Äôs statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary‚Äôs government.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong‚Äôs recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

‚ÄúThe court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court‚Äôs view, made the case more serious,‚Äù the judge said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: ‚ÄúEveryone hang in there, add oil,‚Äù using a phrase of encouragement meaning ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: ‚ÄúI will hang in there.‚Äù

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù in his stomach, according to a post on the activist‚Äôs social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday‚Äôs sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted ‚Äúanother blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong‚Äù.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. ‚ÄúI urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,‚Äù he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong‚Äôs arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù and described it as ‚Äúanother example of HK authorities targeting activists‚Äù.

Wong has maintained a defiant approach during the court case, saying last week: ‚ÄúI am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.‚Äù

He also urged people to focus on the plight of the ‚ÄúHong Kong 12‚Äù, the detained group accused of attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat in August. They have been held in a mainland detention centre ever since, with their families accusing authorities of denying the group access to lawyers, visitors, or medical treatment.

Chow, who gave up her British citizenship to run in Hong Kong elections, was one of the first Demosisto politicians barred from standing for office because the party advocated ‚Äúself-determination‚Äù.

One of her most successful roles has been bringing international attention to Hong Kong‚Äôs democracy movement, aided by her fluency in English, Cantonese and Japanese. She built a huge social media following in Japan in particular. Chow was arrested in August under the national security law, on the vague suspicion of ‚Äúcolluding with foreign forces‚Äù.

At least 31 people have been arrested under the national security law imposed by Beijing in late June, which outlaws a broad range of acts as sedition, secession, foreign collusion, and terrorism.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
696,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim‚Äôs daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother‚Äôs death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: ‚ÄúDirect fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.‚Äù

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had ‚Äúfractures of the entire right hemifacial bone‚Äù. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim‚Äôs chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane‚Äôs apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded ‚Äúthe weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police‚Äù. It added: ‚ÄúThere is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired‚Äù, and concluded the grenade had ‚Äúhit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection‚Äù.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that ‚Äúthere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas‚Äù. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

‚ÄúThere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,‚Äù the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: ‚ÄúIt was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.‚Äù

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. ‚ÄúShe was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,‚Äù Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

‚ÄúThe police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.‚Äù

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

‚ÄúThis is a political issue. It‚Äôs important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

‚ÄúMr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.‚Äù

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by ‚Äúscientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts‚Äù who had examined the ‚Äúangle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,‚Äù he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
697,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November‚Äôs presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

‚ÄúNot a day goes by where there‚Äôs not a crowd outside,‚Äù Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump‚Äôs election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù was Giuliani‚Äôs response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani‚Äôs 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business‚Äôs branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

‚ÄúThis is a construction yard, that‚Äôs a liability,‚Äù Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

‚ÄúIt did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‚ÄòWho knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?‚Äô‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians‚Äô incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

I woke up early, still laughing at Rudy Giuliani spewing bullshit from an industrial lot between a crematorium and dildo shop, having booked a press conference into the Four Seasons...wait for it...Total Landscaping.

Trump himself lent weight to the idea of mistaken identity when he tweeted, then deleted, that the press conference was at ‚ÄúFour Seasons, Philadelphia‚Äù.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

‚ÄúI gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

‚ÄúThe response is overwhelming, that there‚Äôs still so, so many good people in the world, and they got to laugh with this,‚Äù Siravo said.

698,"Six in a row: winning numbers in South African lottery are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10",[],"An unusual sequence of numbers drawn by South Africa‚Äôs national lottery has left players dumbfounded and sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a ‚ÄúPowerBall‚Äù number of 10 were the South African national lottery‚Äôs winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (¬£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

‚ÄúCongratulations to tonight‚Äôs 20 winners of PowerBall draw,‚Äù the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThese numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.‚Äù

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

‚ÄúLotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,‚Äù posted one Twitter user. ‚Äú20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,‚Äù ventured another. ‚ÄúAbsolutely no way in hell that‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma‚Äôs nine-year tenure.

South Africa‚Äôs National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review ‚Äúand if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo we are in the process of doing that currently.‚Äù

699,Trump lawyer: ex-election security chief Krebs should be 'taken out and shot',[],"A former head of US election security who said Donald Trump‚Äôs defeat by Joe Biden was not subject to voter fraud should be ‚Äútaken out at dawn and shot‚Äù, a Trump campaign lawyer said.

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a ‚Äúmob attorney‚Äù.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump‚Äôs claims, ‚Äúwas the most secure in American history‚Äù.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit ‚Äì and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

‚ÄúAnybody who thinks the election went well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.‚Äù

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to ‚Äúundermine democracy ‚Ä¶ to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people‚Äù.

Trump called that interview ‚Äúridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke‚Äù.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president‚Äôs disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump‚Äôs legal team was ‚Äútalking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I‚Äôve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre going to have to be dealt with politically. It‚Äôs the only way you deal with these people.‚Äù

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden‚Äôs win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThreats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It‚Äôs behavior befitting a mob attorney.‚Äù

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made ‚Äúa retaliatory threat involving Krebs‚Äô official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351‚Äù.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and DiGenova should ‚Äúface disbarment at least‚Äù.

Trump‚Äôs comments appeared to acknowledge that he thought he could have lost the election. While speculation about a presidential run in 2024 has been rife, and many US politics watchers expect him to declare a bid soon, he has not spoken publicly about it before.

The video was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee of the party, Pam Pollard, who is national committee member for the Oklahoma GOP. The footage showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks. Coughing could be heard.

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors ‚Äì violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president‚Äôs aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady‚Äôs spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, ‚Äúwhile providing the safest environment possible.‚Äù She said that would include smaller guest lists, that ‚Äúmasks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending the parties will be a very personal choice,‚Äù she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

‚ÄúIf the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,‚Äù Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms‚Äô content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a ‚Äúmust-pass‚Äù because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won‚Äôt agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

Joe Biden, the US president-elect, formally introduced his top economic advisers on Tuesday, as his incoming administration prepares to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Bipartisan group pitches $908bn Covid-19 relief to break deadlock in Congress Read more

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to create a recovery for everybody,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúOur message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he ‚Äúmight have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical‚Äù about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúLost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American tragedy and it‚Äôs essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world‚Äôs population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths ‚Äì more than 268,000 ‚Äì with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: ‚ÄúThe team I‚Äôm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.‚Äù

His ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: ‚ÄúReward hard work in America, not wealth. It‚Äôs time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It‚Äôs time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.‚Äù

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Neera a long time,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.‚Äù

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that‚Äôs dumb.‚Äù

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders‚Äôs 2020 campaign, tweeted: ‚ÄúEverything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.‚Äù

For Biden, Tuesday‚Äôs sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump‚Äôs false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden‚Äôs victory, meaning Trump‚Äôs legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

The electoral college, which selects the president based on state-by-state results, is scheduled to meet on 14 December. Biden will take office on 20 January.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
702,Wisconsin and Arizona certify Biden wins in yet another blow to Trump,[],"Joe Biden‚Äôs victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump‚Äôs longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden‚Äôs nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

‚ÄúToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,‚Äù Wisconsin‚Äôs governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.‚Äù

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden‚Äôs lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin‚Äôs Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.‚Äù

Kaul noted that Trump‚Äôs recount targeted only the state‚Äôs two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. ‚ÄúI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn‚Äôt a game of gotcha.‚Äù

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state‚Äôs 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden‚Äôs overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump‚Äôs legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden‚Äôs narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

The 2020 election is over again, with certifications today in Arizona and Wisconsin.

Arizona‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

‚ÄúWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,‚Äù Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election ‚Äúwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona‚Äôs laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary‚Äù.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump‚Äôs lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the ‚Äúgreatest scam ever perpetrated against our country‚Äù. When he mentioned Ducey‚Äôs name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of ‚Äúrushing to sign‚Äù papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: ‚ÄúArizona won‚Äôt forget what Ducey just did.‚Äù

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.‚Äù

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone‚Äôs ringtone for calls from the White House is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

Trump‚Äôs denials of political reality have left him increasingly isolated as a growing number of Republicans acknowledge the transition and Biden moves ahead with naming appointments to his administration.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.

Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes programme on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere is no foreign power that is flipping votes. There‚Äôs no domestic actor flipping votes. I did it right. We did it right. This was a secure election.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
703,Coronavirus live news: Germany extends restrictions to 10 January; Putin orders start of mass inoculation,[],"18:01

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
704,Mexico: L√≥pez Obrador says pandemic lockdowns are the tactic of dictators,[],"Mexicos‚Äôs President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador suggested on Wednesday that politicians who impose lockdowns or curfews to limit Covid-19 are acting like dictators.

The comments came as L√≥pez Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask, saying it was a question of liberty.

The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people‚Äôs movements are ‚Äúfashionable among authorities ‚Ä¶ who want to show they are heavy-handed, dictatorship.

‚ÄúA lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúthe fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty.‚Äù

L√≥pez Obrador‚Äôs comments came a day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Mexico was ‚Äúin bad shape‚Äù with the pandemic and urged its leaders to take the coronavirus seriously.

‚ÄúThe number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,‚Äù said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In his commments on Wednesday, it was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries, or the mainly opposition-party local leaders in Mexico.

Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes, something L√≥pez Obrador has fiercely resisted doing, arguing some people live day-to-day on what they earn on the streets.

Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement, which resulted in scandals of abusive behavior by police.

L√≥pez Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary.

‚ÄúEveryone is free. Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so,‚Äù L√≥pez Obrador said.

The Mexican government has gone against the grain of international anti-virus practices in two ways. It has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks, and has described mass testing as wasteful and pointless.

Mexico has seen almost 107,000 test-confirmed deaths so far, the fourth-highest toll in the world, but Mexico does relatively little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is closer to 150,000.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
705,"Beware fake coronavirus vaccines, says Interpol",[],"Agency warns police forces to prepare for criminal gangs to try to sell illicit vaccines

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

UK approves Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine for rollout next week Read more

It said the pandemic had already triggered ‚Äúunprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour‚Äù and warned of a new wave of criminal activity ‚Äúin relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs ‚Äúplan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives‚Äù, the Interpol secretary general, J√ºrgen Stock, said.

‚ÄúIt is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of ‚Äúunauthorised and falsified‚Äù coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

‚ÄúIt is important to be vigilant, sceptical and safe, as offers which appear too good to be true usually are,‚Äù the agency said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
706,France will carry out border checks to stop skiers from spreading Covid,[],"France will carry out random border checks over the holiday season targeting French skiers on their way to and from foreign resorts ‚Äì particularly Switzerland and Spain ‚Äì where slopes stay open, the prime minister, Jean Castex, has said.

‚ÄúThe goal is to avoid French citizens getting contaminated. That will be done by performing random checks at the borders,‚Äù Castex told French television, adding that returning holidaymakers would be ordered to quarantine for seven days.

While Alpine resorts in France will technically be open over Christmas, ski lifts and other essential winter sports infrastructure, as well as bars and restaurants, will not as the country strives to avoid fuelling a third wave of the coronavirus.

Italy and Germany share the French position and have indicated, to the fury of many local businesses, that their pistes will remain in effect closed over the Christmas and new year periods, which can account for up to 20% of some resorts‚Äô income.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, last week joined Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in calling for a Europe-wide shutdown of winter sports until 10 January.

Coronavirus clusters in Alpine resorts such as Austria‚Äôs Ischgl played a key role in the spread of the virus during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, with holidaymakers bringing Covid-19 back home following ski trips abroad.

Austria also said on Wednesday that while skiing could resume on 24 December, lift capacity would be limited, bars, restaurants, and hotels would remain largely closed until January, and people entering the country from abroad would have to quarantine.

The measures in effect mean skiiing will only be possible over the holiday season for locals who live close to the slopes. The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it should be possible ‚Äúfor a large part of our population to go skiing at least for the day‚Äù.

Conte asked Italians not to take to the slopes at all during the Christmas holidays, and called on all other European countries with major winter sports sectors to agree common rules to prevent cases being imported if Italy‚Äôs pistes stayed closed.

‚ÄúIt will not be possible to allow winter sports holidays this year, we cannot afford it,‚Äù the Italian prime minister said, arguing that despite a strict safety protocol devised by operators, ‚Äúeverything revolving around holidays on the snow is uncontrollable‚Äù.

Switzerland and Spain, however, have so far proved reluctant to impose restrictions. The Swiss interior minister, Alain Berset, said last week the country was ‚Äúautonomous. We can decide for ourselves whether we leave ski areas open. But we know what‚Äôs at stake.‚Äù

The Swiss government is expected to formally announce its position on limiting foreign visitors on Friday, while the Spanish government is still consulting with its autonomous regions on what measures to take.

Castex said on Wednesday that Switzerland and Spain were ‚Äúnot thus far falling into line‚Äù, but that ‚Äúdiplomatic action is continuing ‚Äì the die has not been completely cast‚Äù. He said he would continue ‚Äúto protect my fellow citizens by preventing them from going to contaminate themselves‚Äù, adding that the French measures were also ‚Äúabout being fair to French resort managers‚Äù.

One French resort, Ch√¢tel in the Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area, has draped Swiss flags around the village in protest against France‚Äôs stance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem with a French government that shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,‚Äù the mayor, Nicolas Rubin, said.

Macron had indicated on Tuesday that the French government was considering taking ‚Äúrestrictive and dissuasive measures‚Äù to prevent the French from going abroad to ski, especially in Switzerland, over the holiday period.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said this week that the risk of catching Covid-19 while actually skiing was minimal. ‚ÄúI suspect many people won‚Äôt be infected barrelling down the slopes on their skis,‚Äù he said.

But he said the real risks ‚Äúare going to come at airports, tour buses taking people to and from ski resorts, ski lifts ... and places where people come together‚Äù. The WHO was advising all countries to ‚Äúlook at their ski season‚Äù, he said, warning that indoor socialising after skiing might pose a particular threat.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that ‚Äúthe scientists have done it‚Äù, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with ‚Äúover-optimism‚Äù, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.‚Äù

There were still ‚Äúimmense logistical challenges‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúSo it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it‚Äôs all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we‚Äôre not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.‚Äù

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning‚Äôs press conference announcing the vaccine‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAnd what a momentous ‚Ä¶ journey and international effort it has been,‚Äù Van-Tam said. ‚ÄúDiscovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.‚Äù

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. ‚ÄúIf we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‚ÄòOh, the vaccine‚Äôs here, let‚Äôs abandon caution,‚Äô all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.‚Äù

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a ‚Äúcomplex product‚Äù and ‚Äúreally tricky to handle‚Äù, explaining: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.‚Äù

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was ‚Äúgoing to eradicate coronavirus ever‚Äù, but we may get to the point where it becomes ‚Äúa seasonal problem‚Äù like flu. He added: ‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us,‚Äô like the end of the war? No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

708,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to ‚Äúsure and certain knowledge that we will succeed‚Äù after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel ‚Äúquite emotional‚Äù.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected ‚Äì including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions ‚Äì it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

‚ÄúBecause of Brexit, we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,‚Äù Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK ‚Äì and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law ‚Äì but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,‚Äù he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid ‚Äúoveroptimism‚Äù and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England‚Äôs lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

‚ÄúIt will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,‚Äù he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it‚Äôs going to be with humankind forever,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us!‚Äô like the end of the war?

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt. I think those kind of habits, that we‚Äôve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ‚Ä¶ on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called ‚Äúa real cause for concern‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,‚Äù he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said ‚Äúeveryone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut‚Äù in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.‚Äù

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

‚ÄúThis authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
709,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own ‚Äúrobust‚Äù approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, contrasting the UK approach with the ‚Äúpace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly‚Äù.

The EMA said the bloc‚Äôs member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the ‚Äúappropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens‚Äô access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns‚Äù.

Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. ‚ÄúWe have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.‚Äù

The EMA‚Äôs statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included ‚Äúessential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign‚Äù.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation ‚Äúare not expected to affect significantly vaccines‚Äô availability‚Äù. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. ‚ÄúIn years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity‚Äôs charge against this disease,‚Äù he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: ‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don‚Äôt think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.‚Äù

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: ‚ÄúWe may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.‚Äù

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: ‚ÄúIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.‚Äù

710,Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans,[],"Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a ‚Äúsuper-spreader event‚Äù.

The gathering, called ‚ÄúNaughty in N‚Äôawlins‚Äù saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event‚Äôs organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

‚ÄúIf I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,‚Äù Hannaford wrote.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.‚Äù

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N‚Äôawlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

‚ÄúWhen we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,‚Äù Hannaford said.

‚ÄúIn almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‚ÄòFuck it, it‚Äôs our last day‚Äô and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.‚Äù

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

‚ÄúWe did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‚ÄòNo Dancing‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn‚Äôt really outlaw dancing.

‚ÄúBut seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

711,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan‚Äôs Princess Mako ‚Äì the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne ‚Äì and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom‚Äôs mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan‚Äôs royals; it has also brought the country‚Äôs succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro‚Äôs mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako‚Äôs father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

‚ÄúI approve of them getting married,‚Äù he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. ‚ÄúThe constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.‚Äù

But, he added, Komuro‚Äôs family needed to make a ‚Äúvisible‚Äù response to his mother‚Äôs financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I don‚Äôt think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]‚Äù ‚Äì adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor‚Äôs daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan‚Äôs succession laws, no female member of the imperial family ‚Äì not even the emperor‚Äôs 19-year-old daughter, Aiko ‚Äì can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako‚Äôs younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

712,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it‚Äôs been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK‚Äôs first female prime minister?

It‚Äôs a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council‚Äôs controversial decision to underwrite a ¬£100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: ‚ÄúWe find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúShe was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country‚Äôs has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.‚Äù

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long hard road. There‚Äôs been a few knocks and bumps along the way,‚Äù Schonhut said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see things finally coming to fruition.‚Äù

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit like a mini Brexit,‚Äù she said. She hopes it‚Äôll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . ‚ÄúIn the area we‚Äôre living in we‚Äôre seeing a huge number of homeless people, we‚Äôre seeing food banks springing up all over the place.‚Äù

Burgess added that given Thatcher‚Äôs controversial legacy it was a ‚Äúpoorly judged decision‚Äù to push ahead with the statue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.‚Äù

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

‚ÄúI appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it‚Äôs a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.‚Äù

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. ‚ÄúThe first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
713,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, ‚Äúa lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?‚Äù Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry ‚Äì but rarely their male counterparts ‚Äì have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt find a mother as appealing‚Äù. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had ‚Äúunderestimated this whole mommy thing‚Äù.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry‚Äôs disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children‚Äôs perspective on her last album (‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre going but you don‚Äôt say how long for / You say it‚Äôs work, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US ‚Äúnearly tore me apart‚Äù, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds ‚Äì leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms ‚Äì moving from the ‚Äúfemale pop star‚Äù category to the even more restrictive ‚Äúmum‚Äù box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

‚ÄúI hardly ever get asked about being a father,‚Äù says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter‚Äôs future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly‚Äôs Tom Fletcher ‚Äì whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I‚Äôm a Celebrity ‚Ä¶ contestant Giovanna Fletcher ‚Äì says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

‚ÄòWe knew we could have a support structure‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Thurston Moore and daughter Coco in 1995. Photograph: John Zich/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another human being.‚Äô So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.‚Äù Hot Chip‚Äôs Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children ‚Äúget upset when I am about to go away‚Äù, they ‚Äúunderstand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not only their own family‚Äôs financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for ‚Äì their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to let anyone down by saying, ‚Äòit would be great to do that festival, but we can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt,‚Äô‚Äù he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. ‚ÄúI think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it‚Äôs our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.‚Äù

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician‚Äôs living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by ‚Äúspeeding back during the night‚Äù after shows, and then ‚Äúdoing the school run in the morning‚Äù. Do his peers see that as normal? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúThey think that‚Äôs mad!‚Äù Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives‚Äô respective due dates, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a band, people expect to see you on stage,‚Äù says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,‚Äù he later said. Fletcher ‚Äì who had his first child ‚Äútwo weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career‚Äù ‚Äì was equally untroubled by the experience. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.‚Äù

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. ‚ÄúAbout 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live ‚Äì we drove our family car with him,‚Äù he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife‚Äôs mother) travelled ‚Äúall around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe‚Äù, an undertaking he describes as ‚Äúpretty easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot too hectic‚Äù.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth‚Äôs huge success during the decade: ‚ÄúWe made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.‚Äù Any earlier ‚Äúwould have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. ‚ÄúEveryone was there to give us everything we needed.‚Äù

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. ‚ÄúThe only person who would ever do that is a band‚Äôs manager and they might say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs going to impact on our finances‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù says Goddard. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.‚Äù The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. ‚ÄúHot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,‚Äù Goddard says. ‚ÄúThe band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.‚Äù Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules ‚Äúpretty challenging‚Äù, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out‚Äù.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of ‚Äúmum guilt‚Äù ‚Äì the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children ‚Äì men have the much milder husband guilt. ‚ÄúMy worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,‚Äù says Spearman, with Goddard adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have ‚Äì my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn‚Äôt have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.‚Äù

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,‚Äù says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn‚Äôt mind him taking paternity leave, ‚Äúif a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that‚Äôs different.‚Äù Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop ‚Äì ‚Äúthere are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older‚Äù ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúthe hormones, what happens to your body‚Äù that men don‚Äôt experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don‚Äôt have any children: ‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt really get those questions: ‚ÄòAre you going to settle down and have a child?‚Äô Women must be asked about it all the time.‚Äù When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. ‚ÄúI would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‚ÄòI probably will have some kids.‚Äô‚Äù

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon‚Äôs work ‚Äúwas going to be interrupted‚Äù. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be focused, but it‚Äôs also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It‚Äôs not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.‚Äù Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact ‚Äì albeit only temporarily. ‚ÄúHaving a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything ‚Äì what my daughter would think in years to come.‚Äù

Little monsters of rock ‚Ä¶ Ozzy Osbourne with son Jack, 1985. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.‚Äù Ghetts says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood‚Äôs cool, fatherhood‚Äôs sick‚Äù.

Goddard is more ambivalent. ‚ÄúMy coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.‚Äù Spearman says Everything Everything didn‚Äôt want to mention fatherhood ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in the press release for their new album, ‚Äúbecause it makes us look a bit old. And it‚Äôs a bit of cliche to be like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve written a record about having a kid,‚Äô which is not what our record is about. We don‚Äôt want to overstate it.‚Äù

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven‚Äôt noticed any real-world implications yet. ‚ÄúWe got playlisted on Radio 1,‚Äù he says happily. ‚ÄúNot bad for a dad band!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
714,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite ‚Äì it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It‚Äôs the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I‚Äôve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I‚Äôve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali‚Äôs fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis‚Äô days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone‚Äôs view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn‚Äôt show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I‚Äôd show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn‚Äôt have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy ‚Äì most photographers don‚Äôt hang around the magazine‚Äôs photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn‚Äôt mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali‚Äôs head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali‚Äôs next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you‚Äôd ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there ‚Äì I went with him once. They‚Äôd wind him up saying: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!‚Äù He‚Äôd reply: ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôd have had him in two rounds!‚Äù

I can count on one hand the athletes I‚Äôve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson‚Äôs disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist‚Äôs ear ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We‚Äôd do a studio shot and he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you 20 minutes‚Äù ‚Äì then an hour later he‚Äôd still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better ‚Äì maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I‚Äôve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

715,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. ‚ÄúTo come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,‚Äù he said.

Watt‚Äôs photographs of the forest ‚Äì and the grim aftermath of logging ‚Äì are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the ‚Äúgraveyard of stumps‚Äù in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we‚Äôre allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people are shocked that that‚Äôs still happening here. It‚Äôs not illegal. The government sanctions it.‚Äù

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province‚Äôs southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island‚Äôs original old growth forests ‚Äì where Watt shot his before-and-after series ‚Äì are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) ‚Äì or about 1% of the deferred areas ‚Äì is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,‚Äù said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. ‚ÄúThat means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.‚Äù

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep taking these ‚Äòbefore‚Äô photos,‚Äù said Watt. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs up to politicians if there‚Äôs going to be an ‚Äòafter‚Äô shot.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
716,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan‚Äôs Netflix epic. Firstly, it‚Äôs just as well The Crown isn‚Äôt on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation‚Äôs enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman‚Äôs Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia ‚Äì not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there‚Äôs nothing. Well, there‚Äôs Prince Charles but Josh O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons‚Äô Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn‚Äôt so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen‚Äôs children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana‚Äôs arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù on offer. It‚Äôs a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts ‚Äì for example, there‚Äôs no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II‚Äôs sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn‚Äôt they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling ‚Äì which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed ‚Äúfairytale‚Äù wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it‚Äôs simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there‚Äôs no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures ‚Äì such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II‚Äôs successor refusing to sign a bill into law ‚Äì or mined Britain‚Äôs deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV‚Äôs Victoria and BBC/Showtime‚Äôs The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you‚Äôre watching. In the latest series, there‚Äôs a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew ‚Äì then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal ‚Äì talks to the Queen about his private life. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù she later reflects to her husband. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt change ‚Ä¶‚Äù The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function ‚Äì and the aesthetics ‚Äì of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple‚Äôs courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4‚Äôs comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show‚Äôs writers have recognised that she doesn‚Äôt belong in that world ‚Äì a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it‚Äôs obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there‚Äôs a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic ‚Äì the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period ‚Äì the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there‚Äôs a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan‚Äôs withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations ‚Äì of royals and commoners alike ‚Äì might well wonder whether it‚Äôs all worth it.

717,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you‚Äôre going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They‚Äôve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It‚Äôs too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That‚Äôs fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs not right. They‚Äôve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don‚Äôt have all the best words to do this because I‚Äôm angry. And the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job ‚Ä¶ in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he‚Äôs one of the better ones they‚Äôve got. His family‚Äôs getting harassed now. There‚Äôs a noose out there with his name on it, and it‚Äôs just not right.

I‚Äôve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It‚Äôs just wrong. I can‚Äôt begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

Mr President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We‚Äôre investigating, there‚Äôs always a possibility, I get it. You have the rights to go to the courts. What you don‚Äôt have the ability to do ‚Äì and you need to step up and say this ‚Äì is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed, and it‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs not right ‚Ä¶ all of this is wrong.

DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former US attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better. Mr President, as the secretary said yesterday, people aren‚Äôt giving you the best advice of what‚Äôs actually going on on the ground. It‚Äôs time to look forward. If you want to run for re-election in four years, fine ‚Äì do it. But everything we‚Äôre seeing right now, there‚Äôs not a path. Be the bigger man here, and step in. Tell your supporters: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be violent. Don‚Äôt intimidate.‚Äù All that‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs un-American.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
718,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government‚Äôs ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It‚Äôs both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I‚Äôve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I‚Äôm torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year‚Äôs Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn‚Äôt going to stop transmission. It‚Äôs best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you‚Äôre likely to smell the smoke. It‚Äôs the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area ‚Äì the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you‚Äôre not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they‚Äôre not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government‚Äôs decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn‚Äôt worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I‚Äôm less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
719,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever ‚Äúour‚Äù is and whenever that ‚Äúday‚Äù might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: ‚ÄúOh God, we‚Äôre doing anarchism at the moment ‚Äì it‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism‚Äôs central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there‚Äôs a T-shirt slogan there, I‚Äôm sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father‚Äôs wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. ‚ÄúOf course she wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening‚Äôs source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter‚Äôs adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

‚ÄúHow are you doing, Ryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù he said happily. ‚ÄúLiving the dream.‚Äù

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself ‚Äúto the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active‚Äù. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a ‚Äúmisconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There‚Äôs definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we‚Äôve got a few Thatcherites in our class.‚Äù

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren‚Äôt born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs everything, isn‚Äôt it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.‚Äù Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this ¬£17,000-a-year establishment, she said: ‚ÄúThere were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I‚Äôve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.‚Äù No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that‚Äôs quite a start. ‚ÄúThings have deteriorated quite significantly since then,‚Äù he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it‚Äôs never like that.‚Äù

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of ‚Äúreal‚Äù politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it ‚Äúinteresting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.‚Äù

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view ‚Äì or those of your tribe ‚Äì and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: ‚ÄúNothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.‚Äù

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

720,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it,[],"When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday‚Äôs news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours ‚Äì a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn‚Äôt really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government‚Äôs proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone ‚Äì regardless of nationality or political affiliation ‚Äì is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
721,The Guardian view on Poland‚Äôs Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Krak√≥w, Marek Jƒôdraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the European Union‚Äôs Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù clause, Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a ‚Äúneo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God‚Äôs kingdom‚Äù. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender ‚Äúideology‚Äù in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October‚Äôs controversial abortion ruling by Poland‚Äôs constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops‚Äô conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS‚Äôs leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, called on Poles to ‚Äúdefend the church at any price‚Äù. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church‚Äôs authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II‚Äôs judgment was criticised in last month‚Äôs Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope‚Äôs secretary, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church‚Äôs steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczy≈Ñski, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to ‚Äúabandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance‚Äù. Their statement denounced attempts to ‚Äúexploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party‚Äù. If the country‚Äôs ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
722,Covid has shown me what lies beyond boredom: post-boredom,[],"I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. ‚ÄúGood, thanks. You?‚Äù I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. ‚ÄúWhat did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, umm ‚Ä¶ got really into jigsaws for a bit. Rearranged the spare room into an office. Learned to make this one really good curry recipe from the BBC website. Uh ‚Ä¶ got 11 solo wins and about 24 duo wins on Fortnite.‚Äù Is that good?, they‚Äôll ask, and I‚Äôll have to admit that no, not particularly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game for 12-year-olds that I play compulsively,‚Äù I‚Äôll explain. ‚ÄúEvery day I log in and let adolescents embarrass me in an online world that allows them to dance joyously on the remains of my corpse.‚Äù Oh, they‚Äôll say. I think there‚Äôs something ‚Äì I think there‚Äôs something happening in the other room. I really ought to‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs important to address the fact that I am bored. I am, to my bones, bored of this. I know that in the current climate, being bored is a high luxury, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any more thrilling. In fact, I am so deep into boredom that I have burrowed beneath the previously accepted boundaries of the concept, and have now emerged, apathetically, into post-boredom.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a ‚Äúsign of a life falling apart‚Äù to something I was doing ‚Äúfor the moral good of the country and the world as a whole‚Äù, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I‚Äôd thrive in the ambient boredom of prison ‚Äì not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I‚Äôd get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That‚Äôs not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one ‚Äì no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing ‚Äì but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it‚Äôs psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it‚Äôs possibly even worse that we‚Äôve worn boredom down to the bone. If we‚Äôve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself ‚Äì someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something ‚Äì the answer can only be ‚Äúchaos‚Äù.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won‚Äôt be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much ‚Äì stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it‚Äôs hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We‚Äôre all tiptoeing around the idea that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It‚Äôs hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I‚Äôm certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

723,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we‚Äôve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world‚Äôs human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We‚Äôve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some ¬£1.5bn of the UK‚Äôs commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it‚Äôs coming under threat from the government‚Äôs proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don‚Äôt yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map ‚Äì it‚Äôs also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged ¬£7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world‚Äôs most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested ¬£12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed ¬£120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network‚Äôs priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We‚Äôve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, ‚ÄúAntimicrobial resistance ‚Ä¶ threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily‚Äù. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK‚Äôs track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government‚Äôs decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

724,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you‚Äôve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of ‚ÄúDivine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.‚Äù

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn‚Äôt include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for those who haven‚Äôt seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit ‚Äì it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there ‚Äì but somehow it didn‚Äôt really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone‚Äôs accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%‚Äôs mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren‚Äôt one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It‚Äôs weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on ‚Äì giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
725,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found chess cathartic | Nancy Jo Sales",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix‚Äôs series The Queen‚Äôs Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I‚Äôd ever played anyone, I‚Äôd lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I‚Äôm more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I‚Äôd never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it‚Äôs exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I‚Äôve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other ‚Äì sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny‚Äôs funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they‚Äôd ever known.

But it isn‚Äôt always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny‚Äôs escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was ‚Äì he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I‚Äôd been playing chess for a few months ‚Äì first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online ‚Äì I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I‚Äôd started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He‚Äôs the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It‚Äôs a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage ‚Äúfootball without fans is nothing‚Äù is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all.

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid ‚Äúunnecessary movement‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, without having to purchase a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal‚Äôs poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we‚Äôll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language.

732,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC‚Äôs decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúverification‚Äù from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

‚ÄúThe shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,‚Äù a BBC spokesperson said. ‚ÄúOn this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.‚Äù

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

‚ÄúThis is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I‚Äôve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don‚Äôt vote.‚Äù

Fury‚Äôs initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury‚Äôs team offered a farmer ¬£25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements ‚Äì citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury‚Äôs team to lie. Fury‚Äôs subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as ‚Äútotal bullshit‚Äù.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury ‚Äì who earlier that year had claimed that ‚Äúthere are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.‚Äù

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked.

The 24-year-old, who also rode her first Royal Ascot winner and became the first woman to ride five winners on the same card at odds of 899-1 at Windsor in August, said: ‚ÄúRacing can be in its own little bubble as such, so hopefully this might help to open the door to a wider audience.‚Äù

734,"Mick Schumacher's family name is blessing and a curse, says Damon Hill",[],"Damon Hill has said Mick Schumacher deserves his shot at Formula One success but has warned the son of the seven-times world champion Michael that living up to a family name can be both a blessing and a curse.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill‚Äôs father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher‚Äôs F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

‚ÄúThere is a sense that some people don‚Äôt want you to have a go,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI felt like some people felt: ‚ÄòWhy is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.‚Äô It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.‚Äù

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

‚ÄúI wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad‚Äôs life and career and applied them to my racing.

‚ÄúJacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.‚Äù

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

‚ÄúIt really is tragic what happened to Michael,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.‚Äù

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

‚ÄúI have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.‚Äù

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher‚Äôs best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

‚ÄúIn a way it‚Äôs very simple ‚Äì if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
735,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed ‚Äúill-judged criticism‚Äù from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been ‚Äúconvicted of racism‚Äù.

Porto‚Äôs move came after City drew 0-0 at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as ‚Äúan opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism‚Äù.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: ‚ÄúHis tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.‚Äù

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto‚Äôs coach Sergio Concei√ß√£o accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Concei√ß√£o described Silva as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù for a tweet that followed City‚Äôs victory in which the midfielder wrote: ‚ÄúThis one felt so good!‚Äù

Porto‚Äôs newsletter claimed Guardiola had a ‚Äúbad disposition after the meeting‚Äù on Tuesday and quoted Concei√ß√£o as saying: ‚ÄúI would also be upset if I couldn‚Äôt win with the team he has and the budget he has.‚Äù

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: ‚ÄúDespite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt buy class or notion.‚Äù In response a City spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

‚ÄúIn 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.‚Äù

The incident referred to came at the Drag√£o in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City‚Äôs XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: ‚ÄúStrange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn‚Äôt going to work.

He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year‚Äôs NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The contract extension, once it is made official, will guarantee James career earnings of $429m.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

739,'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration,[],"Spanish archipelago has received 20,000 migrants and refugees this year, 8,000 in the last month

'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration

In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus.

The streets of Arguinegu√≠n, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon.

Almost 15 years after the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees.

Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018.

Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguinegu√≠n. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguinegu√≠n, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309.

The people held at the temporary centre ‚Äì officially for a maximum of 72 hours ‚Äì are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms.

There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents.

Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system.

Spain‚Äôs public ombudsman has called for the Arguinegu√≠n camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people‚Äôs basic rights.

Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mog√°n, of which Arguinegu√≠n is a part.

Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island‚Äôs capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay.

While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will.

‚ÄúThis lack of humanity from the government just can‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.‚Äù

And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù in 2006.

Jos√© Segura Clavell, who was the central government‚Äôs representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the ‚Äúhumanitarian reception‚Äù to which they are entitled.

If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs behaviour is a mistake,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a clear common policy.‚Äù

The lack of a clear, common ‚Äì and fair ‚Äì approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU‚Äôs new migration and asylum proposals.

‚ÄúWe believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,‚Äù the four countries said.

‚ÄúThe frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.‚Äù

In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguinegu√≠n dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people ‚Äì including more than 455 unaccompanied children ‚Äì are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mog√°n.

But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that ‚ÄúMog√°n‚Äôs solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December‚Äù and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere.

The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after.

‚ÄúIf I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,‚Äù Jalloul said on Thursday.

‚ÄúDo you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?‚Äù

Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry ‚Äì which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible ‚Äì says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks.

Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October ‚Äúin search of a future‚Äù. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister.

But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home.

Kamara says the Canaries ‚Äì ‚Äúa great place‚Äù ‚Äì remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off.

‚ÄúI was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,‚Äù says Kamara.

Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with.

The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain.

For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp ‚Äújust goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago‚Äù.

Like many others ‚Äì not least the regional president of the Canaries ‚Äì Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, ‚Äúviews island territories as prisons‚Äù.

But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries.

In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into.

‚ÄúUntil we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we‚Äôre going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,‚Äù says Santana.

‚ÄúThere will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
740,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain‚Äôs new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her ‚Äúdelight, after many years of campaigning,‚Äù that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens‚Äô right to work and live in UK ‚Äì a key Brexit ask ‚Äì or British nationals‚Äô right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

‚ÄúIt will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,‚Äù said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. ‚ÄúI built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is ‚Ä¶ a shock.‚Äù

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell‚Äôs mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and ‚Äì like his sister ‚Äì two dual-nationality children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very settled; we have careers and families,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not thinking of going home yet.‚Äù

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. ‚ÄúMy big worry is my mother,‚Äù Frizell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fit and well, but if she needed looking after ‚Ä¶ Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now ‚Äì but not for much longer.‚Äù

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, ‚Äúalmost without restriction‚Äù.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù Godfrey said, ‚Äúif you want to come back with your non-British partner, you‚Äôll need to earn ¬£18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they‚Äôll have to meet the new points system.‚Äù

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs ‚Äì NHS surcharges, fees ‚Äì could run into thousands of pounds.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a massive change,‚Äù said Godfrey. ‚ÄúIt basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it‚Äôs asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible choice, and it‚Äôs really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.‚Äù

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. ‚ÄúThe government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.‚Äù

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. ‚ÄúThe government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúWe just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we‚Äôre not talking about a never-ending stream of people ‚Äì it‚Äôs a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It‚Äôs just nonsense.‚Äù

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home ‚Äì and if we don‚Äôt move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It‚Äôs hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.‚Äù

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship ‚Äì but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

‚ÄúIf we wanted to move back we‚Äôd have to go through so many hoops now,‚Äù Woodford said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not sure we‚Äôd meet the minimum income. It‚Äôs seems unfathomable to me ‚Ä¶ Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.‚Äù

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband ‚Äúcould not possibly decide by March 2022‚Äù whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

‚ÄúBut how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years ‚Äì she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that‚Äôs been taken away.‚Äù

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

‚ÄúBrexit means I can‚Äôt do that now, because I don‚Äôt yet have a full residence permit, so I can‚Äôt leave Greece for more than three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that‚Äôs not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.‚Äù

The couple would be ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. ‚ÄúIt just seems so sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people‚Äôs choices taken away ‚Äì all those things my generation could do ‚Ä¶ And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.‚Äù

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

‚ÄúDaniel may want to come back ‚Äì not yet, certainly, but at some stage,‚Äù Barbara said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn‚Äôt look very fair or equal to me.‚Äù

741,"'If the EU says we can‚Äôt open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni‚Äôs grandmother Adelina began the family‚Äôs ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

‚ÄúI have never not known a ski season,‚Äù said Di Bendinoni. ‚ÄúEven the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.‚Äù

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Gernot Bl√ºmel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

‚ÄúIn Italy we‚Äôre in limbo, when you don‚Äôt know what will happen from one day to the next,‚Äù said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni‚Äôs cousin and a ski instructor. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians ‚Äì if the EU says we can‚Äôt open, then they should pay for it.‚Äù

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy‚Äôs third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d‚ÄôOulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgen√®vre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about ‚Ç¨11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere‚Äôs inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

‚ÄúSome got ‚Ç¨600, others ‚Ç¨1,200,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don‚Äôt discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt carry on. We‚Äôre at that level and politicians need to understand.‚Äù

Gianni Poncet, the village‚Äôs mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,‚Äù Poncet said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants ‚Äì across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn‚Äôt begin we will lose ‚Ç¨1bn.‚Äù

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular apr√®s-ski spot, said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.‚Äù

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

‚ÄúEven if people from abroad can‚Äôt come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,‚Äù Giovanni Brasso said. ‚ÄúIn the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.‚Äù

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves ‚Ä¶ and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

‚ÄúWe expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,‚Äù Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. ‚ÄúNobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,‚Äù Safaryan says.

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

‚ÄúWhen we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúEven after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äô It never happened.‚Äù

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

‚ÄúI was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,‚Äù she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. ‚ÄúGeographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.‚Äù

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. ‚ÄúArmenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúWe had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn‚Äôt trustful coexistence.‚Äù

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. ‚ÄúI asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLater we learned it was about unification with Armenia.‚Äù

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. ‚ÄúWe said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúWe even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.‚Äù

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. ‚ÄúSlowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúOne day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,‚Äù Hajiyeva recalls. ‚ÄúAfter that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.‚Äù

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. ‚ÄúI opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,‚Äù she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúMy parents just woke up and realised war had begun.‚Äù

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. ‚ÄúSome days they couldn‚Äôt even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúThey were very bad, very harsh days.‚Äù

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan‚Äôs favour.

‚ÄúThe whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,‚Äù she claims. ‚ÄúThey left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.‚Äù

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh‚Äôs Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan‚Äôs parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. ‚ÄúThey are just existing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what we are going to do.‚Äù

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúSome people were saying, why have you left your city?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.‚Äù

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. ‚ÄúThe house has survived the occupation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what‚Äôs happening in my city.‚Äù

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. ‚ÄúMy friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always prepared myself that once I‚Äôll be back in Shusha, I‚Äôll start my new life from zero.‚Äù

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. ‚ÄúI cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,‚Äù Hajizada said. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.‚Äù

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm nobody now,‚Äù Safaryan says.

‚ÄúEverything I was living and fighting for ‚Äì making plans for big projects in Hadrut and every village and city in Artsakh ‚Äì and now there‚Äôs nothing. Nothing to fight for, and nothing to live for.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
743,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel‚Äôs parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday‚Äôs vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz‚Äôs Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday‚Äôs bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country‚Äôs longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

‚ÄúNetanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,‚Äù Gantz said. ‚ÄúShow me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: ‚ÄúNetanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.‚Äù

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. ‚ÄúNow is not the time for elections,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúNow is the time for unity.‚Äù

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu‚Äôs ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

‚ÄúI was well aware of his track record as a ‚Äòserial promise-breaker‚Äô, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gantz said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúNetanyahu didn‚Äôt lie to me ‚Äì he lied to all of you.‚Äù

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,‚Äù Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

‚Äú[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,‚Äù wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

‚ÄúThe prime minister‚Äôs ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù slogans like ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

‚ÄúYou lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you‚Äôre actually going to get the changes you want done,‚Äù the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

Here's what interviewing voters taught me about the slogan 'defund the police' | Danny Barefoot Read more

‚ÄúThe key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?‚Äù Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important ‚Äúnew blood‚Äù in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äì who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president‚Äôs interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats ‚Äì including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù was not about mere words but a ‚Äúdemand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a ‚Äòslogan‚Äô,‚Äù said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge ‚Äì ultimately unsuccessfully ‚Äì the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs seat in the November election.

Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) We didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a slogan.



Instead of conceding this narrative, let‚Äôs shape our own. It‚Äôs time we listen to the people, organize and build coalitions around our own message, and cast a vision that inspires us all to lead for change at the ballot box and beyond. https://t.co/mBg7wanaR6

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù was ‚Äúnot a slogan. It‚Äôs a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Mr President ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about losing people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We‚Äôre losing our loved ones to police violence.‚Äù

The Black Lives Matter movement member‚Äôs rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police ‚Äì a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health ‚Äì factors that contribute to crime.

The former president‚Äôs comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) Damn, Mr. President.



Didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúTrayvon could‚Äôve been my son?‚Äù

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden‚Äôs flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

‚ÄúIf you instead say ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs reform the police department so that everybody‚Äôs being treated fairly,‚Äô‚Äù Clyburn offered alternatively. ‚ÄúNot just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?‚Äô‚Äù

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

‚ÄúShe speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,‚Äù he said, adding that across political ideologies ‚Äúnew blood is always good‚Äù for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
745,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, ‚Äúproductivity score‚Äù, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators ‚Äúhelp their people get the most‚Äù from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

‚ÄúAt Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,‚Äù Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe also believe that privacy is a human right, and we‚Äôre deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.‚Äù

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren‚Äôt contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. ‚ÄúGoing forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level ‚Äì providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,‚Äù Spataro says. ‚ÄúNo one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. ‚ÄúProductivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,‚Äù Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern workforce transformation‚Äù unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

‚ÄúThe thing I love most about Microsoft is that when we screw up, we acknowledge the error and fix it,‚Äù Snover tweeted. ‚Äú10,000 thanks to Wolfie Christl and others for the feedback which led to this change!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
746,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don‚Äôt count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor‚Äôs note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board ‚Äúeroded the public trust in legitimate service animals‚Äù.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people ‚Äúfraudulently representing their pets as service animals‚Äù, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog‚Äôs health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can‚Äôt bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned ‚Äúpit bull type dogs‚Äù in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, ‚ÄúAt this time, there are no changes to Delta‚Äôs current service and support animal policies.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Read more

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

‚ÄúThere are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.‚Äù

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

‚ÄúBut it is malaria that can explode the fastest ‚Äì it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‚Äòcanary in the coalmine‚Äô that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.‚Äù

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia‚Äôs interest.

And a similar proportion ‚Äì 56% ‚Äì believe that if Australia doesn‚Äôt support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

‚ÄúAs a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.‚Äù

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

‚ÄúAustralians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours ‚Ä¶ indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.‚Äù

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad‚Äôs ‚Äúlieutenant‚Äù in a scheme to hide up to ¬£453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a ¬£30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was ‚Äústressed and scared‚Äù about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister‚Äôs home in Russia.

‚ÄúI got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams ‚Ä¶ harassing me. I‚Äôm drinking a lot,‚Äù he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I was on the streets ‚Ä¶ [But] I‚Äôm not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúnot hiding‚Äù in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings ‚Äúway in excess‚Äù of the ¬£3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that ¬£3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter‚Äôs mother had become accustomed. ‚ÄúNow maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it‚Äôs different,‚Äù he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her ¬£453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the ¬£30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son‚Äôs emails.

Akhmedova‚Äôs legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband‚Äôs ¬£300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club‚Äôs owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day‚Äôs work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have money in the budget to pay for contributors.‚Äù Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a ‚Äúdecent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name‚Äù, which would help boost the band‚Äôs following on Instagram and Facebook.

‚ÄúHopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,‚Äù they were told by the show‚Äôs producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians‚Äô Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: ‚ÄúThe days of ‚Äòit‚Äôll give you exposure‚Äô (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won‚Äôt get any gigs these days and we won‚Äôt sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production ‚Ä¶ They want us and our expertise, but they won‚Äôt pay for it.‚Äù

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: ‚ÄúLike all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven‚Äôt raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven‚Äôt monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

‚ÄúWe do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than ¬£20,000 a year, is a pittance.‚Äù

750,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste‚Äôs fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured and privileged and I‚Äôm going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.‚Äù

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery‚Äôs story as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

‚ÄúToday the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

‚ÄúHowever, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

‚ÄúBernard Collaery‚Äôs story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers‚Äô lawyers are now being targeted.‚Äù

Collaery and Witness K‚Äôs cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

The council warned that the laws were protecting ‚Äúbroadly defined national security at the expense of the rights of the accused‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
751,Canadian security firm GardaWorld raises G4S takeover offer to ¬£3.7bn,[],"Investors have two weeks to decide whether to accept final offer of 235p a share in cash

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to ¬£3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at ¬£3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a ¬£770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a ¬£3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

Shares in G4S rose 7.5% to 246p on Wednesday .

GardaWorld‚Äôs chief executive and founder, St√©phan Cr√©tier, said: ‚ÄúShareholders have a simple choice: remain invested in a company which has consistently failed them and the wider community for so many years, or realise their investment in cash, at a significant and highly attractive premium.

‚ÄúG4S needs an owner-operator that understands the people-orientated nature of the sector with the resources, time and expertise to solve the many challenges faced by the business.‚Äù

G4S investors now have until 16 December to decide whether they want to accept GardaWorld‚Äôs final offer.

Last month, G4S said it would start paying a dividend again and claimed the group could reach revenue growth of between 4% and 6% a year if it remained independent.

But the firm reported a ¬£91m loss for 2019 after it was forced to write down the value of its cash handling business. It has also announced plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs to reduce costs.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‚ÄúG4S management have been pushing back for some time against GardaWorld; however, with Allied Universal Security also lurking in the background, G4S shareholders are likely to find this new offer compelling, especially since the shares are up over 50% since the initial September bid.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
752,Nike Japan ad on teenage bullying and racism sparks debate,[],"A video made by Nike Japan that explores bullying and racism using three schoolgirl footballers has sparked praise and outrage online, including calls to boycott the company‚Äôs products.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù and beautiful,‚Äù but others were less impressed.

While the film‚Äôs message clearly riled members of Japan‚Äôs online right ‚Äì many of whom commented using pseudonyms ‚Äì more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

‚ÄúIs Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you‚Äôre creating a false impression of Japan,‚Äù said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: ‚ÄúNowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that‚Äôs prejudiced is Nike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so much fun to blame Japan?‚Äù another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country‚Äôs multiracial rugby team at last year‚Äôs world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn‚Äôt Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the ‚Äúzainichi problem‚Äù ‚Äì a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are ‚Äústaying in Japan‚Äù.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world‚Äôs highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka‚Äôs sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she ‚Äúlooked sunburned‚Äù and ‚Äúneeded some bleach‚Äù.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

‚ÄúWe have long listened to minority voices, supported and spoken for causes that fit our values,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe believe sports have the power to show what a better world looks like, to bring people together and encourage action in their respective communities.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
753,World is ‚Äòdoubling down‚Äô on fossil fuels despite climate crisis ‚Äì UN report,[],"The world‚Äôs governments are ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid ‚Äúsevere climate disruption‚Äù. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThe pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,‚Äù said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

‚ÄúAlas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of zombie energy.‚Äù

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: ‚ÄúWith governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year‚Äôs devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,‚Äù said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (¬£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world‚Äôs fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we‚Äôre beginning to see that happen,‚Äù said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: ‚ÄúWorking together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.‚Äù

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: ‚ÄúGovernments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies ‚Äì this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we‚Äôre going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.‚Äù

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to ‚Äúshow climate leadership‚Äù by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: ‚ÄúThe world ‚Äì and its people ‚Äì are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
754,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‚Äòone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äô and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called ‚Äúone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äù.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised ‚Äúthe devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire‚Äù.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the ‚Äúalarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity‚Äù including the decline in New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and MƒÅori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must ‚Äúact with urgency‚Äù.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

‚ÄúThis declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.‚Äù

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service‚Äôs buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the ‚Äúsignificant progress on meeting the challenge‚Äù by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation ‚Äì which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äì made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and had become ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. ‚ÄúThe irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.‚Äù

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: ‚Äú[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs declaration also said the government will ‚Äúdemonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government‚Äôs own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025‚Äù.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs all very well to declare an emergency but there‚Äôs no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,‚Äù Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government‚Äôs fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation‚Äôs biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand‚Äôs pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
755,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world‚Äôs coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world‚Äôs biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries ‚Äì Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal ‚Äì will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction ‚Äì known as exclusive economic zones ‚Äì are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.‚Äù

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: ‚ÄúAustralians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods ‚Ä¶ When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.‚Äù

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world‚Äôs oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was ‚Äúa really big deal‚Äù and could restore the health of the world‚Äôs oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

‚ÄúWhat you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it‚Äôs not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant ‚Äì business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe oceans are in a very sorry state right now.‚Äù

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.‚Äù

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: ‚ÄúIf we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.‚Äù

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world‚Äôs oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of ‚Äúghost‚Äù fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a ‚Äúcircular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik √ñsterblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: ‚Äú[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.‚Äù

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world‚Äôs oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ‚ÄúThe UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
756,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing ‚Äì a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other‚Äôs perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls ‚Äì meaning that they push their joypad‚Äôs thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen ‚Äì the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not per se a topic we‚Äôd study in our lab, we‚Äôd had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,‚Äù explains Corbett. ‚ÄúThis was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.‚Äù

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? ‚ÄúGenerally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúThere are no right or wrong answers in these tasks ‚Äì we‚Äôre interested in how people might perform differently. We‚Äôll obtain one or two measures ‚Äì for example, average reaction time, average accuracy ‚Äì from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.‚Äù

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual‚Äôs visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. ‚ÄúFor example,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.‚Äù

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúMost research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can‚Äôt really process more than a few details at once. There‚Äôs a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.‚Äù

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what‚Äôs on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

‚ÄúSuch findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‚Äòreal‚Äô flight consoles,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúIn a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.‚Äù

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

‚Ä¢ Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

757,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace ‚Äì review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain ‚Äì and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens ‚Äì all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don‚Äôt ‚Äì because, obviously, they weren‚Äôt allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen‚Äôs pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art ‚Äì and this collection ‚Äì to HM using the term ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù. This old school art snob would no more have said ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù than he‚Äôd have said ‚Äútaken to Twitter‚Äù. He‚Äôd have said ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù or ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen‚Äôs Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection‚Äôs finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I‚Äôve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt‚Äôs rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam‚Äôs Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar‚Äôs anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he‚Äôs studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They‚Äôre consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing ‚Ä¶ Rembrandt‚Äôs Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / ¬© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I‚Äôll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It‚Äôs hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here‚Äôs the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He‚Äôd recently lost his wife. A friend ‚Äì thought to be William, Lord Crofts ‚Äì is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck‚Äôs mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer‚Äôs surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they‚Äôre in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It‚Äôs either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens‚Äôs personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There‚Äôs a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi‚Äôs Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show ‚Äì she painted it for Charles I ‚Äì and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection‚Äôs virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I‚Äôm grateful that some of the royal family‚Äôs treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It‚Äôs hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

Engineering numbers.

Speaking of Mad As Hell, Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews are two of the best sketch writers I‚Äôve ever gotten to work with. This is the intro clip for their show MAGMA, which you can go and watch on demand here https://sospresents.com/ along with other incredible Australian comedians like Double Denim and Jude Perl.

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‚ÄòI will just warn you before I go any further ...‚Äô

As a comic it‚Äôs hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She‚Äôs just so good.

4) Steve Irwin being bitten by a snake three seconds after he says it won‚Äôt bite

‚ÄòThe only reason I‚Äôm doing this is because this one‚Äôs a python ...‚Äô

The only not-stand-up clip that I‚Äôve included. The snake has impressive comic timing considering it‚Äôs a snake. Steve Irwin is such a gentleman with beautiful manners. Take a moment to appreciate the dedication of the puppeteer and the host‚Äôs brave gaze. I don‚Äôt know what else you could want.

5) Danielle Walker‚Äôs joke about her grandad‚Äôs grave

‚ÄòHe calls it his man grave.‚Äô

Probably one of the bits I try and retell badly to people the most. Sorry for butchering it at dinner parties, Danielle.

6) This clip from Kirsty Webeck

‚ÄòI had a little nibble.‚Äô

Kirsty has such a delightful energy. This clip was a nice surprise 2020 treat the other week when it came through my feed.

7) Alice Fraser

‚ÄòA bit testerical are we?‚Äô

Alice has a plethora of amazing comedy available online, but this is a great intro if you haven‚Äôt seen her work before. The punchline count in this four and a half minutes is genuinely incredible.

8) Jude Perl‚Äôs Hungry and Horny

‚ÄòProudly brought to you by ...‚Äô

Jude is just plain talented. If I‚Äôm ever having a bad day I put on her albums for an instant boost.

9) Jack Druce ‚Äì just Jack Druce in general

‚ÄòSay what you will about a single bed ...‚Äô

Jack is the most unique joke writer I can think of and I really love his work. It was pretty hard to select my favourite clip so I really recommend watching the full show on his channel. He‚Äôs also got a great newsletter that you can‚Äôt see on the internet unless you sign up for it here.

759,Godmothered review ‚Äì Disney remixes Enchanted ‚Ä¶ minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There‚Äôs the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles ‚Äì swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

Superintelligence review ‚Äì Melissa McCarthy can't save unfunny AI comedy Read more

It‚Äôs impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney‚Äôs 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor‚Äôs career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland‚Äôs closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams‚Äôs Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there‚Äôs winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom ‚Äì Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor‚Äôs preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor‚Äôs self-centered ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù feels earned. But Godmothered‚Äôs tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother‚Äôs overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there‚Äôs one ‚Äì co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) ‚Äì within reach), but its shoehorned revelation ‚Äì that true loves comes in many forms ‚Äì is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious ‚Äì unrealistic in the parts where it‚Äôs trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor‚Äôs misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a bumpy, underwhelming ride ‚Äì not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
760,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world ‚Äì it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‚ÄòLast night,‚Äù says Laima Leyton, ‚ÄúI went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramoviƒá. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn‚Äôt have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.‚Äù

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists ‚Äì Leyton among them ‚Äì about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly‚Äôs condemnation of petty domesticity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall‚Äù ‚Äì and Tracey Emin‚Äôs oft-quoted line: ‚ÄúThere are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.‚Äù

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,‚Äù painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer‚Äôs wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report‚Äôs data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that‚Äôs not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists‚Äô careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn‚Äôt factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world ‚Äì motherhood. My resulting essay ‚Äì Full, Messy and Beautiful ‚Äì was published alongside this year‚Äôs report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

‚ÄúMy experience,‚Äù Anna Perach told me, ‚Äúis that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‚Äòsold out‚Äô or joined the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.‚Äù

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with ‚Äúthe holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids‚Äù, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can‚Äôt be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn‚Äôt come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn‚Äôt have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? ‚ÄúPaying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,‚Äù said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There‚Äôs now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities ‚Äì buzz, aura, image ‚Äì there is quite simply a problem of perception. ‚ÄúWomen artists are marginalised generally,‚Äù as Jemima Burrill put it. ‚ÄúMothers are almost beyond the pale.‚Äù

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are ‚Äì and have been ‚Äì great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù that a woman cannot excel as both.

761,"Faith review ‚Äì compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains ‚Äúwarrior monks‚Äù in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks‚Äô daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white ‚Äì it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn‚Äôt help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there‚Äôs no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions ‚Äì five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken ‚Äì to fuel his narcissism and ego, I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I‚Äôd like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

762,‚ÄòAs consumers we all have tremendous impact‚Äô: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we‚Äôre on if we‚Äôre to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you‚Äôre a climate science denier, you‚Äôll be familiar with ‚Äì and anxious to see something done about ‚Äì a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive ‚Äì going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚Äì the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it‚Äôs from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The ‚Äúnatural carbon storage‚Äù of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft‚Äôs target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it‚Äôs a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs a mindset,‚Äù says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. ‚ÄúWe decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We‚Äôre embracing the challenge.‚Äù

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations ‚Äì ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it‚Äôs the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion‚Äôs share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,‚Äô says Henkel‚Äôs Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company‚Äôs direct influence presents challenges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúTake our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can‚Äôt make you switch your energy supplier. But it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.‚Äù

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel‚Äôs global carbon footprint ‚Äì just 2% compared with Ikea‚Äôs 11%, for example ‚Äì the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.‚Äù

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites ‚Äì both thermal and photovoltaic ‚Äì any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company‚Äôs plans.

‚ÄúIf we have the right energy infrastructure in place ‚Äì similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montorn√®s del Vall√®s in Spain, for example ‚Äì we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,‚Äù says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory ‚Äì so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Modern concentrated detergents require far less to be used, thus saving bulk and raw materials. Photograph: RoBeDeRo/Getty Images

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúToday, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It‚Äôs quite a dramatic progress.‚Äù Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: ‚ÄúThe classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it‚Äôs too easy to do right now.‚Äù Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. ‚ÄúThe capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,‚Äù Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. ‚ÄúWe have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,‚Äù says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: ‚ÄúOur products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers ‚Äì and ultimately consumers ‚Äì save energy and carbon.‚Äù

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. ‚ÄúYou, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúDo I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?‚Äù

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. ‚ÄúVideo-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,‚Äù says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. ‚ÄúLaundry won‚Äôt complain if you wash it cold, so that‚Äôs easier. Your clothes will last longer and your electricity bill will be lower,‚Äù says Bergmann, adding that decades of research has enabled Henkel to produce detergents that function at these lower temperatures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about generating a good value proposition ‚Äì the behavioural change will follow.‚Äù

For all the company‚Äôs good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat. The first step to combating this is having a clear breakdown of our own carbon footprints. ‚ÄúThis transparency enables us to make informed choices,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe all need to take gradual steps, rather than just seeing an overwhelming target that we‚Äôll struggle to achieve.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
763,‚ÄòThe holy grail of packaging recycling‚Äô: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there‚Äôs one thing the British public likes to complain about, it‚Äôs recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn‚Äôt, where it ends up and who‚Äôs paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn‚Äôt always straightforward. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really hard to identify what kind of material it is,‚Äù says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. ‚ÄúIf the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it‚Äôs covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,‚Äù he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it‚Äôs vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies ‚Äì essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‚ÄòThe objective is to increase farmer incomes‚Äô: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer‚Äôs bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. ‚ÄúThis means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,‚Äù says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it‚Äôs a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. ‚ÄúIt makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today‚Äôs problems in sorting and recycling packaging,‚Äù says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. ‚Äú[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.‚Äù

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product‚Äôs website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. ‚ÄúMaybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],‚Äù he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. ‚ÄúWe are in a very early pioneering phase,‚Äù he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. ‚ÄúEven with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.‚Äù

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold‚Äôs mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. ‚ÄúIt brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,‚Äù he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. ‚ÄúThis means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.‚Äù

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this testing to the next level.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. ‚ÄúI think it was my children,‚Äù he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. ‚ÄúAs they‚Äôve gotten older, they‚Äôve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.‚Äù

In the salon‚Äôs new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There‚Äôs a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He‚Äôs also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he‚Äôs already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there‚Äôs been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs added a real buzz to the salon,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú[Clients] feel they‚Äôre doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what‚Äôs going on [in the world].‚Äù

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. ‚ÄúA big turning point was David Attenborough‚Äôs The Blue Planet,‚Äù she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. ‚ÄúI had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green.‚Äô‚Äù

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than ¬£5,000 a year. ‚ÄúThere are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we‚Äôve found a lot of win-wins,‚Äù Baden says. ‚Äú[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients‚Äô behaviour. They‚Äôre connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.‚Äù

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai G√∂rlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel‚Äôs brands. ‚ÄúWe truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,‚Äù he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, G√∂rlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf‚Äôs Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children‚Äôs Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. ‚ÄúHairdressing is a skill, a craft ‚Äì it‚Äôs teachable,‚Äù Ellis says. ‚ÄúSo we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.‚Äù Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. ‚ÄúShe ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed my life.‚Äô It‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. ‚ÄúI felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.‚Äù Many will go on to set up their own businesses ‚Äì Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‚ÄúHe said that it‚Äôs such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,‚Äù G√∂rlitz says of Son. ‚ÄúIn 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.‚Äù And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, G√∂rlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel‚Äôs Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. ‚ÄúShaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.‚Äù

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he‚Äôs felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever, we‚Äôve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That‚Äôs incredible. There‚Äôs been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
765,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue ‚Äì its stickiness ‚Äì is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 ‚Äì the 2020 target is 60% ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind‚Äôs environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: ‚ÄúThe issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.‚Äù

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It‚Äôs things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes ‚Äì generally, anything that doesn‚Äôt spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. ‚ÄúIt costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn‚Äôt collect and sort it,‚Äù he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex‚Äôs goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK‚Äôs circular economy package ‚Äì an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value ‚Äì will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It‚Äôs all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we‚Äôll see a change for flexible packaging then. ‚ÄúWhen the EPR system is launched in 2023, we‚Äôre hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,‚Äù he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won‚Äôt be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time ‚Äì let‚Äôs say cardboard ‚Äì and also for plastics,‚Äù says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel‚Äôs projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. ‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?‚Äô He said he‚Äôd worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!‚Äù

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer ‚Äì often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec‚Äôs technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. ‚ÄúThe debonding allows you to recover more [materials],‚Äù Bankmann says. ‚ÄúIt will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.‚Äù

The adhesives developed with Saperatec‚Äôs recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel‚Äôs RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. ‚ÄúAs the targets go up and we‚Äôre increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,‚Äù he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
766,17 delicious loaf tin recipes (that aren‚Äôt banana bread),[],"A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost ¬£2 ‚Äì even the cheapest model will set you back about ¬£2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough ‚Äì about 900g.

So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity ‚Äì any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin ‚Äì some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner‚Äôs lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin ‚Äì and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.

A good place to start is plain old bread ‚Äì specifically, Dan Lepard‚Äôs sour cream sandwich loaf. While it is possible to knock up endless free-form, rustic loaves at home, the point of the tin is to make bread that in some way resembles the stuff you buy in a shop: sharp-cornered, sandwich friendly, toaster ready. Lepard‚Äôs method relies on a quick knead ‚Äì about 10 seconds ‚Äì repeated at 10 minute intervals, plus a final rise in the tin. In this, and in every recipe here, you would be wise first to line your tin with greaseproof paper, even if the loaf tin in question is non-stick. If you like living dangerously, feel free to ignore this warning and accept the consequences.

Claire Thomson‚Äôs porridge bread makes good use of leftover cold porridge, mixed in with the white flour. For a darker, gluten-free bread, Lepard offers multiseed and molasses bread. Besides molasses (or black treacle), the recipe requires a mix of potato starch, cornflour, rice flour, psyllium husk, egg white and a selection of seeds. But because there is no gluten, there is no need to knead: you end up with a sort of batter that firms itself up as it rises.

Loaf tins are not just for bread ‚Äì you can also use them to make loaf-shaped cakes, a pound cake being one of the best and simplest. Traditionally, pound cake contained a pound of each of the four main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs), but you don‚Äôt need a maths degree to realise that this would overwhelm a 2lb tin. Instead, try this recipe for vanilla pound cake, which calls for 200g of each (that means three eggs), along with a teaspoon of untraditional, but wholly welcome, baking powder.

Drizzle cake is another loaf tin standard. Felicity Cloake‚Äôs perfect version is a close relative to pound cake, with some ground almonds and lemon zest thrown in and, of course, the drizzle. Fergus Henderson‚Äôs seed cake, meanwhile, is one of the few dedicated elevenses recipes out there, best administered with a glass of something while lunch is still a distant prospect. The seed in question is caraway; the something should be madeira.

Rachel Roddy‚Äôs marmalade cake is yet another variation ‚Äì the proportions are the same as for pound cake, although the amounts here suggest a 1lb loaf tin may be a more suitable size. Tamal Ray‚Äôs blood orange syrup loaf is a gluten-free option, using polenta instead of flour. In an emergency, you could profitably employ regular oranges.

Ruby Tandoh‚Äôs blueberry loaf cake is made with yoghurt and almond oil (although she says sunflower oil, with a little added vanilla, works as a substitute). Delia Smith has a recipe for dark Jamaican gingerbread that will allow you to get more use out of that tin of black treacle or molasses you bought to make Lepard‚Äôs bread.

Your loaf tin can also serve as a mould for savoury dishes, most famously meatloaf. There are countless wildly different variations on this classic American dish and I have hit on a few bad ones while trying to recreate the kind my mother made. As ever, it is wisest to rely on Cloake‚Äôs definitive version: after some experimentation, she settles on a recipe containing, among other things, spinach, yoghurt, eggs, garlic, brown sugar and ketchup. If you are looking for something elementary ‚Äì and very much in the humble, no-nonsense spirit of the dish ‚Äì you could have a go at this five-ingredient meatloaf: mince, bacon, sage-and-onion stuffing mix, a beef stock cube and sunflower oil. If you don‚Äôt like the sound of that list, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt like meatloaf.

As far as I am concerned, a terrine tin and a loaf tin are the same thing ‚Äì if you have one, you have both. This means that as soon as you have turned out your bread you can use the tin to whip up a pat√© de campagne. Once again, I am passing on Cloake‚Äôs hard-won expertise, alongside a warning that this will amount to rather more than a lazy afternoon‚Äôs work. Plus, you may have to source some caul fat. Another option is this festive-sounding duck and pork terrine with cranberries and pistachios, which has the advantage of being rather easier to pull together.

A terrine need not be a savoury dish ‚Äì your loaf tin can give shape to all sorts of desserts and puddings. This coffee ice-cream terrine, for example, is made up of layers of coffee and vanilla ice-cream, cemented together with chocolate sauce and left to set hard in the freezer.

Chocolate caramel terrine is another layered pudding ‚Äì this time a caramel, mascarpone, chocolate and cream mixture interspersed with caramel wafers cut to fit your loaf tin. More impressive still is Liam Charles‚Äôs rhubarb and honey panna cotta terrine: a blondie biscuit base with rhubarb jelly on top and panna cotta in between. If you feel uncomfortable making something like that in the same loaf tin you used for meatloaf last week, then I am with you. Best to buy another one for desserts ‚Äì you can get them for about ¬£2.50.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
767,How to make cullen skink ‚Äì recipe | Felicity Cloake's masterclass,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there‚Äôs anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it‚Äôs the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it‚Äôs too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked ‚Äì to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it‚Äôs not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool ‚Äì take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums ‚Ä¶

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 ‚Ä¶ and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them unless they‚Äôre very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice ‚Äì small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink ‚Äì white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury‚Ä¶

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns ‚Äì steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
768,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she‚Äôd taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. ‚ÄúAnd then the next morning, I just went: ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going out.‚Äô‚Äù She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,‚Äù she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself ‚Äì making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

‚ÄúI started to get those feelings last week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible uneasiness. There‚Äôs this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there‚Äôs a feeling of complete hopelessness.‚Äù There are physical sensations, too ‚Äì her heart races, and she feels hot. ‚ÄúAnd just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.‚Äù Although it‚Äôs tough to experience, it is, she says, ‚Äúa godsend that I know what‚Äôs happening now‚Äù.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, ‚Äúthe usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out‚Äù. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious‚Äù.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we‚Äôre not around the people who might spot something is off ‚Äì our family, friends or colleagues ‚Äì and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

‚ÄòIf you are feeling very sad, you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment.‚Äô Photograph: LaylaBird/Getty Images

‚ÄúFor instance, if you are feeling very sad,‚Äù says Robinson, ‚Äúyou would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you‚Äôre not looking forward to anything in the future. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.‚Äù Instead, says Robinson, ‚Äúask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to‚Äù.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. ‚ÄúNormally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut everyone‚Äôs finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can‚Äôt concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?‚Äù

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we‚Äôre living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? ‚ÄúSo ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?‚Äù Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. ‚ÄúSo the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself ‚Äì and in a limited, more muted way than previously ‚Äì am I still able to motivate myself to see people?‚Äù

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. ‚ÄúAgain, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that‚Äôs a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúBut if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can‚Äôt get things done that need to get done, you can‚Äôt get the shopping in, you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat or you‚Äôre overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can‚Äôt function, these would be warning signs to seek help.‚Äù

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you‚Äôre being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and ‚Äúwhether people find that they‚Äôre excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That‚Äôs a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.‚Äù

‚ÄòAsk yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to.‚Äô Photograph: Christopher Hopefitch/Getty Images

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there‚Äôs a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.‚Äù

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about ‚Äúthriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there‚Äôs that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There‚Äôs more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there‚Äôs an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.‚Äù

The core symptoms of depression, he says, ‚Äúare a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that there‚Äôs definitely a mental health condition.‚Äù It‚Äôs when it becomes pervasive and has an ‚Äúimpact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we‚Äôre becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.‚Äù However, he points out, ‚Äúeverybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what‚Äôs normal for you?‚Äù

‚ÄòI found I wasn‚Äôt reading, and I thought: ‚ÄúThis is very odd.‚Äù‚Äô Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images (Posed by model)

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, ‚ÄúI found that suddenly I wasn‚Äôt reading and I thought: ‚ÄòThis is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?‚Äô I‚Äôd start and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a book.‚Äù A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the guitar since lockdown. It‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, but I can‚Äôt kind of get around to doing it.‚Äù During low periods, ‚ÄúI tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I‚Äôll find excuses why I can‚Äôt see them. So I know that I‚Äôve got to force myself to do something.‚Äù Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people ‚Äúand just be silly‚Äù, but obviously it hasn‚Äôt been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it‚Äôs not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise ‚Äì particularly walking ‚Äì works for her, ‚Äúand cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve failed again, you‚Äôre going back to where you were.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like: ‚ÄòNo, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.‚Äù She would seek help, she says, ‚Äúif it got to the point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage it myself‚Äù.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. ‚ÄúThe charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.‚Äù There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. ‚ÄúI would emphasise that it‚Äôs been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,‚Äù says Obuaya. ‚ÄúTherefore we shouldn‚Äôt make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they‚Äôve got a major mental health problem.‚Äù But, he stresses, there is ‚Äúa range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.‚Äù

769,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you‚Äôve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It‚Äôs most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, ‚Äúlife‚Äù is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I‚Äôve been targeted with ads for ‚Äúface yoga‚Äù, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize ‚Äì $25

Who doesn‚Äôt want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 ‚Äúreps‚Äù a day for 30 days. The beginners‚Äô version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you‚Äôve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a ‚ÄúChad‚Äù ‚Äì a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix ‚Äì $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No ‚Äì she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night‚Äôs sleep.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don‚Äôt suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn‚Äôt stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn‚Äôt to say such strips can‚Äôt be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don‚Äôt think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.‚Äù Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it‚Äôs no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it‚Äôs probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good ‚Äì the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you‚Äôve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

‚ÄúMy first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it‚Äôs not too expensive, it‚Äôs very reasonable to try.‚Äù

So can they work? ‚ÄúIn terms of its actual efficacy it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúReally, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.‚Äù However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth a shot‚Äù.

Upright Go 2 ‚Äì $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you‚Äôve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They‚Äôre right, of course, but it‚Äôs also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you‚Äôve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can‚Äôt roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I‚Äôd recommend it the most.

Manly app ‚Äì $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It‚Äôs simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly‚Äôs suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it‚Äôs been stuffed full of sausages.

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they‚Äôve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are. Meanwhile the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I‚Äôm quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you‚Äôre one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre ‚Äì like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people‚Äôs body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we‚Äôre all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it‚Äôs editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it‚Äôs something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
770,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an ‚Äúexclusively English environment‚Äù.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: ‚ÄúAmongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting ‚Ä¶ and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‚Äòcultural habit‚Äô of visiting ‚Ä¶ There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.‚Äù

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show‚Äôs presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country ‚Äì regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland‚Äôs peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

‚ÄúI found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit ‚Äì I imagine it was all three ‚Äì but it was tough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained ‚Ä¶ but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.‚Äù

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

‚ÄúI realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I‚Äôd come back feeling refreshed ‚Äì ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.‚Äù

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

‚ÄúPeople look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it‚Äôs consistently pointed out to you that you don‚Äôt fit in, or when you don‚Äôt see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn‚Äôt be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.‚Äù

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

‚ÄúPosting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it‚Äôs not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.‚Äù

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go ‚Äì her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and ‚Äúdoing something really physical‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,‚Äù she said.

I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

‚ÄúI needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn‚Äôt just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.‚Äù

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

‚ÄúMany people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside ‚Äì the last bastions of whiteness ‚Äì where it is even less diverse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.‚Äù

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton ‚Äì one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

‚ÄúThere are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.‚Äù

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in ‚Äúgrubby holiday homes‚Äù, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn‚Äôt and so it was kind of non-negotiable ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake ‚Äì we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSometimes I didn‚Äôt even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.‚Äù

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

‚ÄúWith swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you‚Äôve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents ‚Äì all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

‚ÄúThere are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
771,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a ‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is ‚Äútrust‚Äù. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life ‚Äì finances, work, household, even grooming ‚Äì so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that ‚Äúagreement‚Äù would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would ‚Äì how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent ‚Äì including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established ‚Äúswingers‚Äù community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

773,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a ‚Äúfertility specialist‚Äù in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City‚Äôs first women‚Äôs hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband‚Äôs sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm‚Äôs daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff‚Äôs office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn‚Äôt heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada‚Äôs doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families ‚Äì 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor‚Äôs treatments ‚Äì shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, ‚Äúthe idea of closure is really impossible,‚Äù Hannah Olson, the film‚Äôs director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how ‚Äúpainful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence‚Äù.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records ‚Äì birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives ‚Äì sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora‚Äôs box of secrets. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn‚Äôt the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn‚Äôt the person they thought he was,‚Äù she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized ‚Äì ‚Äúthis was a phenomenon.‚Äù

Baby God initially follows Babst‚Äôs personal investigation, as she retraces her mother‚Äôs steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier‚Äôs former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality ‚Äì a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable ‚Äì has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier‚Äôs previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. ‚ÄúI feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn‚Äôt violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,‚Äù he says in the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still struggling with that. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up.‚Äù

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. ‚ÄúAt first it was like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get all the facts, we‚Äôre going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,‚Äô‚Äù said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction ‚Äì one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier ‚Äì make the doctor‚Äôs deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù attitude, belief that women don‚Äôt need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn‚Äôt become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, ‚Äúwe ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,‚Äù said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film‚Äôs second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier‚Äôs two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline‚Äôs descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case‚Äôs larger, more unsettling questions. ‚ÄúLooking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it‚Äôs always been illegal. It‚Äôs battery, it‚Äôs malpractice, you can‚Äôt put something in someone‚Äôs body without their consent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTowards the end, it became about making peace with one‚Äôs parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?‚Äù The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a ‚Äúvery bizarre case‚Äù to ‚Äúilluminate something that may be universal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just trying to make peace with our parents.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
774,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It‚Äôs the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It‚Äôs now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it‚Äôs honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It‚Äôs a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum‚Äôs executive director.

‚ÄúEven though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,‚Äù said Horsford. ‚ÄúIt can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.‚Äù

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. ‚ÄúThey think, oh we‚Äôre in the north, that wasn‚Äôt an issue here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it‚Äôs a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.‚Äù

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. ‚ÄúPeople who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don‚Äôt say much more,‚Äù she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it‚Äôs a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

‚ÄúWe wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we‚Äôre talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,‚Äù adds Horsford. ‚ÄúWe never want to say: ‚Äòthese people were just slaves,‚Äô because there‚Äôs so much to the story than just that.‚Äù

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm‚Äôs former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

‚ÄúI wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today‚Äôs generations, are human,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.‚Äù

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

‚ÄúWe must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúNot just select people.‚Äù

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the ‚Äúfront parlor‚Äù, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information ‚Äúrelating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room‚Äù, said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúThese images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.‚Äù

Sydlowski‚Äôs work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, ‚Äúcreated specifically for those who were enslaved‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.‚Äù

It captures an ongoing battle. ‚ÄúNew York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,‚Äù said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúMy installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.‚Äù

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúHighlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,‚Äù said Prevost.

‚ÄúToday, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúFollowing our recent election, we‚Äôve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
775,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn‚Äôt know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry‚Äôs book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we‚Äôve diligently followed Barry‚Äôs class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute ‚Äúattendance card‚Äù, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I‚Äôve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

During the pandemic, many activities I love (eating out, visiting friends) are forbidden. I‚Äôm often too anxious to read for any length of time, and writing‚Äôs a challenge. With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn‚Äôt believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn‚Äôt bear to give away. It‚Äôs meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work ‚Äì writing, reporting, teaching ‚Äì I never worry if I‚Äôm doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we‚Äôve exhausted Lynda Barry‚Äôs attendance cards. Now we‚Äôve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity‚Äôs sake, and it‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that‚Äôs unpredictable ‚Äì will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? ‚Äì it feels good to let go of the ‚Äúperfect drawing‚Äù and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who‚Äôd burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I‚Äôd no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn‚Äôt quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I‚Äôm a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I‚Äôm floating in outer space, miles above Earth‚Äôs problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

776,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' ‚Äì the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"They made quilts to keep the cold at bay. And their bold creations ended up being hailed as masterpieces ‚Äì the visual equivalent of jazz and blues, tokens of solace and defiance in tragic times

Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. ‚ÄúIt seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn‚Äôt believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?‚Äù says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee‚Äôs Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called ‚Äúblack vernacular art‚Äù. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was ‚Äúgoing to change art history‚Äù. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with ‚Äúsongs of sorrow‚Äù from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion ‚Äì quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. ‚ÄúThat the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,‚Äù said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett‚Äôs son, Matt. ‚ÄúThe rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.‚Äù

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett ‚Äì like all the quilters ‚Äì was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt ‚Äì a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 ‚Äì now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters‚Äô work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee‚Äôs Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours ‚Äì typical of the period ‚Äì make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie‚Äôs daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a ‚Äúblock style‚Äù that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. ‚ÄúAs a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they‚Äôd let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,‚Äù she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, ‚Äúbut it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.‚Äù It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee‚Äôs Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw ‚Äì now director of Texas Southern University Museum ‚Äì captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created ‚Äúbetween picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband ‚Ä¶ [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.‚Äù

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts ‚Äì like Qunnie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHousetop‚Äù ‚Äì after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. ‚ÄúNormally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,‚Äù says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. ‚ÄúI do believe that the intentions were good, but I don‚Äôt think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,‚Äù she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It‚Äôs not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren‚Äôt many quilters among the younger generations, she says ‚Äì at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, ‚Äúbut our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste

'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste

For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano‚Äôs 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier‚Äôs pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,‚Äù Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado‚Äôs Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

‚ÄúThis is some of the worst work in the world,‚Äù said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park‚Äôs rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement ‚Äì and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers‚Äô lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill‚Äôs toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel‚Äôs Landing in Utah‚Äôs Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

‚ÄúIf I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out ‚Ä¶ and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,‚Äù Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill‚Äôs toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren‚Äôt cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they‚Äôre not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag ‚Äì often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell ‚Äì or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah‚Äôs Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won‚Äôt degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

‚ÄúPeople are really opening up to the idea,‚Äù Henry said.

Plastic bags aren‚Äôt a perfect fix ‚Äì they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don‚Äôt want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don‚Äôt have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

‚ÄúOnce you get eight miles into the backcountry, it‚Äôs up to you to dig a hole,‚Äù Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
778,Cabaret's Joel Grey: 'Life is tough. But it's also beautiful',[],"‚ÄúShame on you! How could you bring that up? You wanna see a grown man cry?‚Äù Joel Grey is berating me on Zoom. All I wanted to know was how he got the nickname Mr Porno when filming his role as the Emcee, the smirking ringleader he created on Broadway in Kander and Ebb‚Äôs Weimar musical Cabaret. Mercifully, he is teasing me.

It‚Äôs not for the first time in our chat. There is a glint in his eye when he impersonates a ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy, breaks into a snippet of Sixteen Going on Seventeen from The Sound of Music (he once auditioned to play Rolf) and punctuates answers with a high-pitched exhalation that sounds like air escaping from a balloon. When he asks if I want to go to the Oscars I half-believe he‚Äôll take me. His party piece turns out to be an impression of Diana Ross, who handed him his statuette for best supporting actor for Cabaret at the Academy Awards in 1973. ‚ÄúListen to this,‚Äù he says, coming closer to the screen. ‚ÄúAnd the Oscar goes to,‚Äù he half-whispers in a breathy, suspenseful sigh. ‚ÄúJoel ‚Ä¶ Grey!‚Äù

Grey is 88 going on 18. In a pale pink shirt and clear frame glasses, he pops up not with the Emcee‚Äôs willkommen or bienvenue but a perky ‚ÄúHiya! How are ya?‚Äù He is in the office of his New York loft apartment, overlooking Hudson River park. The Oscar can be glimpsed in profile on the windowsill, alongside a Tony award for Cabaret. I‚Äôve already taken a virtual tour of his loft ‚Äì where his own photographs hang among artworks by Robert Rauschenberg and Duane Michals ‚Äì as it was featured in an interior design video online. I compliment him on his airy bathroom where a giant photograph of Machu Picchu hangs next to a monolithic tub. ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre not going in there today,‚Äù he replies briskly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good place for an interview.‚Äù

He has spent the morning making french toast and compiling a personal scrapbook of old pictures. It may be the next in his series of photography books, which have included a volume of vibrant closeup portraits of flowers. One of his lockdown hobbies is buying blooms at a nearby shop, then spending hours ‚Äúpulling them apart and looking deep inside‚Äù. He disappears to fetch a large print of purple petals and holds it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a face,‚Äù he says from behind the photograph. ‚ÄúA scary, beautiful thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs true: the flower resembles a glowing skull, somehow both richly flamboyant and ethereal. The picture remains held up, filling the screen. There is a silence. Do I talk to the flower? ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Grey chuckles from behind it.

With Broadway‚Äôs theatres closed by the pandemic, what has Grey been doing for entertainment? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at TikTok,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that? Everybody is doing it. My grandchild is doing it. And I don‚Äôt know what it is!‚Äù Has he been going out much? ‚ÄúLess and less. I live across the street from the river and there‚Äôs a beautiful park. When we go there, it‚Äôs jammed with people ‚Äì with masks mostly, but I get nervous.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot to fit into Grey‚Äôs scrapbook. He has been acting for almost 80 years. His professional debut, aged nine, was in his home town of Cleveland in On Borrowed Time, a macabre comedy about death. The experience ‚Äúgrabbed my throat and held me to the fire‚Äù, he remembers. ‚ÄúI knew I was an actor.‚Äù It resonated so strongly that he staged a revival of On Borrowed Time a few years ago and, this year, directed a Zoom reading of it. He has returned to Cabaret, too, reprising the Emcee on stage in the 80s. It will always be his most famous role, but there have been many others on Broadway: as the showman George M Cohan (in George M!, the closure of which was blamed on Richard Nixon visiting backstage); the Wizard of Oz in the hit Wicked; luckless ‚ÄúMr Cellophane‚Äù Amos Hart in Chicago, also from Kander and Ebb; and most recently, wistful servant Firs in The Cherry Orchard in 2016.

A year earlier, Grey made headlines when he came out in People magazine at the age of 82. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like labels,‚Äù he told his interviewer, ‚Äúbut if you have to put a label on it, I‚Äôm a gay man.‚Äù It had taken time, he said, to ‚Äúembrace that other part of who I always was‚Äù. In his 2016 memoir, Master of Ceremonies, he wrote about how, since his youth, he had felt forced to hide his sexuality. Grey detailed early relationships, including with a bellboy at the residential hotel where his family lived in an apartment, and described a permanent hyper-alertness about being ‚Äúsmall, sissy, Jewish‚Äù. It is frequently a painful read: his mother is disgusted when he comes out to her as a teenager by telling her about a threesome he had with a cantor from their temple. When he tells his wife, Jo Wilder, about his past gay experiences it deepens a void between them that ends their 24-year marriage in the early 80s. Their children are the actor Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing) and James, a chef. Grey describes how important it was for them both to see him play a gay man on stage, in Larry Kramer‚Äôs landmark Aids drama The Normal Heart, to better understand their father.

One of Grey‚Äôs first film roles (as a smirking law student in Come September in 1961) was opposite Rock Hudson, who was leading his own double life as a gay man in Hollywood. Grey remembers him as ‚Äúa really nice, funny guy‚Äù. When Hudson died of complications from Aids in 1985, it increased awareness of an epidemic that for many was ‚Äútoo horrible to accept or think through‚Äù, Grey says. Denial and misinformation were rife. One scene in The Normal Heart required him to kiss another man. ‚ÄúA friend of mine said, you ought to find out from a doctor whether or not you are putting yourself at risk,‚Äù remembers Grey. ‚ÄúI called this doctor who was taking care of Rock Hudson. He said: ‚ÄòDo you have to kiss the actor?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòYeah, it‚Äôs important in the script.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòThen I wouldn‚Äôt do the play.‚Äô‚Äù Grey wrestled with it and chose the play and the kiss. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI need to tell this story. As an actor it‚Äôs my job.‚Äô And it‚Äôs what I live for.‚Äù He remembers Kramer, who died this year, as a ‚Äútough audience‚Äù, but ‚Äúvery supportive of my work‚Äù.

It is theatre, rather than film or TV, that has been Grey‚Äôs passion since his childhood debut. Back then he was Joel Katz. His grandparents were eastern European Jews who settled in Cleveland. Joel was the first of two sons born to Mickey, a musician and comedian who found fame with his Jewish revue the Borscht Capades, and Grace, who named him after her favourite actor, Joel McCrea, and hungered for him to become famous.

A pair of contrasting scenes in Grey‚Äôs memoir find him alone as a boy. In one, his mother takes him to New York for an audition that never materialises, and leaves him scared in their hotel room when she goes out with a man. In the other, he is accidentally abandoned in the theatre after hours but is unafraid and revels in its backstage magic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want anybody to come and get me,‚Äù he tells me.

At nine, Grey craved a serious theatre career. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I cared about.‚Äù But after appearing in his dad‚Äôs revue, he became a nightclub performer and was spotted by the entertainer Eddie Cantor who gave him a spot on his TV show in 1951 when Grey was 18. His whirlwind routine is on YouTube: wide-eyed and elfin-featured, Grey cracks jokes, barks like a seal, does the charleston and dances like a dream. It‚Äôs a five-minute delight but the result, he says, was that ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get any parts in plays. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòOh no, he‚Äôs a TV guy‚Äô or ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a nightclub guy.‚Äô It kind of got in the way of my legitimacy.‚Äù His nightclub years included playing the London Palladium on a bill with Johnnie Ray, whose more fervent admirers threw Ray their underwear. ‚ÄúSometimes they forgot to clear the stage,‚Äù recalls Grey, who then had to dance a path between the knickers.

He was considering giving up acting when Cabaret came along. Where would he have gone? ‚ÄúAn art gallery,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúOr a hotdog stand.‚Äù The impish Emcee was the first theatre role he was offered without an audition. The songs may have been great but when he first read the script, he was alarmed that he had no dialogue and no direct involvement with the plot. The role was essentially a metaphor for seduction and corruption. ‚ÄúI was worried that it was one-dimensional, that he was a nightclub performer doing numbers.‚Äù That was precisely what Grey had been trying to escape. ‚ÄúI had to find out the psychology [of the Emcee] and who he was off stage so that hopefully I could bring that biography into those numbers.‚Äù

Six-year-old Jennifer would accompany him to the theatre, watching from the wings and even getting made up as one of the Kit Kat Girls in the seedy club. Elements of the Emcee‚Äôs look, notably the neatly combed hair and the bow tie, mirrored how Grey‚Äôs mother had dressed him as a child. Some of the makeup he used was his wife‚Äôs. His co-star Lotte Lenya ‚Äì celebrated chanteuse, ex-wife of Kurt Weill, and James Bond‚Äôs nemesis Rosa Klebb ‚Äì helped him with the German accent. Jill Haworth was Sally Bowles, the club dancer who longs for a gig at a respectable film studio ‚Äì surely a feeling Grey could relate to.

What made Cabaret so groundbreaking? ‚ÄúFirst of all, it was about a heinous and terrifying subject: the Holocaust. There were a lot of people who just wanted to forget about it. They tried to write it out of textbooks.‚Äù The musical‚Äôs unflinching account of antisemitism and persecution remains horribly current, much like Fiddler on the Roof, which Grey recently directed in a Yiddish version at New York‚Äôs Museum of Jewish Heritage. In the years immediately after the second world war, Mickey Katz had had hits with Yiddish parodies of popular songs (Haim Afen Range, for example, after Home on the Range). His father was, Grey wrote proudly in his memoir, ‚Äúinserting Jews into pop culture, so that we belonged, too‚Äù.

Grey says he and the producer-director, Hal Prince, were in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù creating Cabaret together on Broadway. But when Bob Fosse came to direct the film version he did not want to inherit Grey‚Äôs Emcee. ‚ÄúThere was a total standoff.‚Äù It was Fosse who called him Mr Porno, but Grey insists: ‚ÄúHe was the original Mr Porno! He was in burlesque backstage when he was a teenager. He saw all that bizarreness as a kid and was attracted to it.‚Äù Grey came to believe that Fosse‚Äôs animosity towards him was because he wanted to play the Emcee himself. ‚ÄúHe was an excellent performer,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúHe could have done it.‚Äù

At the Oscars, Grey beat three actors from The Godfather ‚Äì James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino ‚Äì and The Heartbreak Kid‚Äôs Eddie Albert. I imagine the Godfather mob glowering at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve forgiven me!‚Äù he laughs.

Cabaret matched its Tony awards tally of eight wins ‚Äì including best director for Fosse and best actress for Liza Minnelli. When Grey‚Äôs name was read out at the Oscars ceremony, there was Minnelli behind him, dressed in canary yellow, rocking wildly with delight. She was a great choice to play Bowles, he thinks, and her own irresistible sense of fun came with a vulnerability, too. Minnelli would fall asleep on his shoulder on the early morning taxi drives from the hotel to the set. The pair went on to launch a nightclub act in Vegas that they toured around the US. One night, she introduced him on stage before he was ready but he strolled on trouser-less regardless. They performed separately and together, with a set list including Cabaret songs.

Decades later, people are still quoting the Emcee to him. Is it an albatross in any way? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù He advances to the screen. ‚ÄúLet me come closer to you: just ‚Ä¶ great!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only boundary-breaking musical he has worked on. Grey has a small but joyous scene in Lars von Trier‚Äôs Dancer in the Dark, tap-dancing in a courtroom with Bj√∂rk. That looked like fun, I suggest. ‚ÄúWrong,‚Äù he barks back. ‚ÄúHard! The two of them [Bj√∂rk and Von Trier] were not connecting. [We] were in the midst of doing something very unique, and the star and the director weren‚Äôt talking.‚Äù

We‚Äôve rambled way beyond our allotted time and Grey has his scrapbook and his art to attend to. But he starts another story about visiting Cleveland‚Äôs art museum as a kid, finding rooms to hide in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be in the Egyptian place getting into one of those sarcophaguses. I had this idea that I could hide in one of them.‚Äù His high-pitch exhale comes back, this time turning into a full ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù I wonder what he would say to nine-year-old Joel Katz, messing around in museums and embarking on his first stage role back in Cleveland. He replies: ‚ÄúStick with it, be who you are. It‚Äôs going to be tough.‚Äù There‚Äôs a beat. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also going to be beautiful.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

790,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire ‚Äì photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria‚Äôs 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: ‚ÄúWalking through the remains of Europe‚Äôs biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.‚Äù

A Valentine‚Äôs Day mug. Valentine‚Äôs Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

‚ÄúBetween the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone‚Äôs home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.‚Äù

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

‚ÄúThe owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.‚Äù

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

‚ÄúThis is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.‚Äù

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child‚Äôs shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

England‚Äôs new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The ‚Äúrule of six‚Äù will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm ‚Äì with last orders at 10pm ‚Äì only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas ‚Äì from 23 December to 27 December ‚Äì there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

796,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London‚Äôs Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: ‚ÄúWithout the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

‚ÄúPolice took a measured response. You, however, didn‚Äôt engage with police ‚Äì police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.‚Äù

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge ‚Äì meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment ‚Äì after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park‚Äôs Speakers‚Äô Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by ‚Äúaddressing the gathering and encouraging ‚Ä¶ others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,‚Äù the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a ‚Äúlight-touch policing‚Äù approach by encouraging the gatherings to ‚Äúdisperse without the necessity for enforcement action‚Äù.

But Corbyn, he added, had ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù participated in the gathering ‚Äúby way of making public addresses‚Äù and that he allegedly ‚Äúdisregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period‚Äù.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 ‚Äúis not a pandemic‚Äù and argue that ‚Äúif it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us‚Äù.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: ‚ÄúThis case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers‚Äô Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

‚ÄúMr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.‚Äù

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A ‚Äúblanket ban‚Äù on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a tremendous result.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
797,'It's lovely to be back': on the streets of three-tier England as lockdown lifts,[],"England‚Äôs second national lockdown lifted on Wednesday, with 99% of the population placed under the second and third tiers of a three-tier regime. However, non-essential shops are allowed to open under every tier, giving shop owners hope for a much-needed high street boost ahead of Christmas. The Guardian went out on Wednesday to take the mood across the different zones.

Tier 1: St Ives

The Three Ferrets pub in the Cornish harbour-side town of St Ives was buzzing with chatter and laughter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lovely to be back,‚Äù said Richard Cockling, 83, a retired merchant seaman and fisherman as he sipped on a celebratory gin and tonic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed this place. The latest lockdown has been the worst ‚Äì long and boring. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back into this place.‚Äù

Keith Tickner, 59, a cleaner, settled down in his usual cosy spot in front of the blazing fire with a group of friends. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how much you miss your mates and your routine until you‚Äôre allowed back,‚Äù he said.

St Ives, a long-beloved retreat for artists, beach lovers and surfers, was recently judged the happiest place to live in the UK. On the day it and the rest of Cornwall became the only area in mainland England to begin life in tier 1 it felt a jolly town to be in.

From first light, the town was packed with delivery lorries restocking the shops, cafes and restaurants. Bleary-eyed kitchen staff emerged from furlough to begin prepping for dinner time while shopkeepers polished windows and scrubbed floors.

‚ÄúLook at that cobweb,‚Äù said Paul Clegg, a potter who specialises in lucky Cornish piskies, his take on the leprechaun, as he buffed his windows. ‚ÄúThis is the best place in the country anyway. So many people who live here came on holiday, then just decided to stay because it‚Äôs so nice. But it does feel a particularly good day today.‚Äù

Opposite, Sarah Allen was putting up Christmas lights outside her cafe, Sky‚Äôs Diner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù She expected to be busy. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get visitors coming from all over the country who want a taste of life in tier 1,‚Äù she said.

Cornwall council‚Äôs leader, Julian German, called it a ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù for the county but asked people not to drop their guard. ‚ÄúCovid doesn‚Äôt care what tier we‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòWe live in a bit of a bubble here‚Äô: Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor shop. Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian

The advantages of living in tier 1 include being allowed to have a drink in a pub without a meal and to meet in a group of up to six indoors as well as outside.

People from tier 3 areas have been urged by the council not to visit Cornwall and the police this week revealed that up to 10 extra cars would be patrolling Devon and Cornwall to deal with Covid rule-breakers.

The council said people from tier 2 areas should bring the restrictions they are subject to at home with them ‚Äúlike hand luggage‚Äù. For example, those in tier 2, should have a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù with their pub drink.

Of course, enforcing such rules are difficult. The Pilchard Press, a real ale pub tucked up an alley near the harbour, was taking no chances. It had fixed a notice to its railings reading: ‚ÄúCornwall residents only‚Äù.

At the Golden Lion pub, licensee Matt Squires said he would be politely asking people where they are from if he did not recognise them. ‚ÄúWe plan to keep people from different tiers separate,‚Äù he said. Locals will be able to use the front bar looking on to the street, visitors the back bar.

Tier 2: Liverpool

‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt seem as scared to come out‚Äô: Rob Pritchard, manager at vintage clothes shop Resurrection in Liverpool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

Vans lined up outside the independent shops and restaurants on Liverpool‚Äôs Bold Street in the morning drizzle to deliver stock to eager staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling festive, we‚Äôve got our Christmas music on and our twinkly lights on,‚Äù said Nicki Whatling, a manager at Rennie‚Äôs Arts and Crafts, as picture frames were unloaded into the store.

While the shop has only 23 days to make up the bulk of lost sales over lockdown, she said she was hopeful the business could ‚Äúhave a fairly decent December‚Äù.

As the day wore on, Whatling‚Äôs wishes began to look more likely, with throngs of Christmas shoppers trickling up and down the city‚Äôs streets. At the vintage clothes store Resurrection, where students were sifting through leisurewear and parents were picking out gifts, the director Rob Pritchard said there had ‚Äúbeen a buzz about the place‚Äù in the middle of the day.

Usually, he said, the store would be much quieter in early December after the Black Friday sales weekend, but he predicted the store would continue to be busy throughout this month. ‚ÄúA lot of people are saying they‚Äôre taking the chance to get back into the city again. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that today,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhen we ended the last lockdown some people were still too scared to come out. This time maybe because the infection rates have fallen so much in Liverpool, they don‚Äôt seem as scared to come.‚Äù

Meanwhile, at the pizza restaurant Crust, the manager Antonio Fornaro was grateful the venue had been able to open ahead of Christmas. ‚ÄúWhen they announced it, I had calls from all my colleagues saying, ‚ÄòYes! We‚Äôre going to be able to open‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Throughout England‚Äôs second national lockdown, takeaway sales had dropped off as people reigned in spending, said Fornaro. But on Wednesday afternoon, the reduced tables and chairs in the restaurant were full once again.

Outside the trainer store Size?, university student Adam Macholc, 18, was one of a small socially distanced group of sneakerheads waiting for the latest Adidas drop as staff inside got ready to open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying them for myself,‚Äù he said, adding that despite a turbulent first term, ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a bit more hope‚Äù after the news that the UK had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

In Liverpool‚Äôs main commercial shopping district, around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, other shoppers seemed to be feeling confident too. A queue snaked around the city‚Äôs Primark store, while shoppers trickled in and out of Debenhams to pick up a bargain.

Willing some of them to stop for a substantial meal and a drink on their way home, was the manager of the Doctor Duncan‚Äôs pub, Amy McCarthy. Under tier 2 regulations, a key difference with tier 1 is alcohol cannot be served without food and there must be no multiple household mixing in venues like Doctor Duncan‚Äôs. The pub, located away from the main shopping centre next to Liverpool Lime Street station, had a quiet day with only a handful of customers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next to the bus stops where people usually head to football games and are known for being the first and the last stop. So it‚Äôs different territory for us having to emphasise our pub grub,‚Äù she said. AW

Tier 3: Nottingham

After a month cooped up indoors, shoppers in Nottingham seized the opportunity to return to the city centre on Wednesday.

The east Midlands city is back in tier 3, and is therefore subject to England‚Äôs toughest coronavirus restrictions. Shops, hair salons and gyms have been allowed to reopen, but hospitality venues must offer takeaway or delivery only.

In the city centre, stallholders were preparing for this weekend‚Äôs opening of the Christmas market on Old Market Square, in the heart of the city.

The prime location is overlooked by an imposing six-storey stone building which houses the department store Debenhams, and on the other side of the square is a Dorothy Perkins and a Burton ‚Äì brands that are part of Philip Green‚Äôs Arcadia empire. Both Debenhams and Arcadia are living on borrowed time, having collapsed into administration on consecutive days this week

If Arcadia‚Äôs brands do not find a buyer, Nottingham will feel the impact of store closures keenly. The city is home to nine Arcadia stores ‚Äì .

Tallulah Harries-Pugh, 29, was holding a Topshop carrier bag, but with an item to return rather than a new purchase.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with Sir Philip Green‚Äôs ethics, and I try not to shop [at Arcadia brands],‚Äù said Tallulah. But she said she was worried about the staff, and what more store closures would mean for the high street.

The scars of another recent retail collapse are clearly visible in Nottingham city centre. One of the city‚Äôs two shopping centres, Broadmarsh, was half-demolished with plans under way for a multimillion pound redevelopment, when its owner, the retail property company Intu, collapsed in June.

The city council has been handed the keys to the development and has already spent ¬£19m on the project. Councillor Sam Webster, whose ward covers the city centre, concedes it won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. The project is probably the biggest regeneration in a core city in the country‚Äù.

In the short-term, however, Nottingham‚Äôs businesses have to contend with tier 3 restrictions.

Prof David Paton from Nottingham University business school warns that retailers will feel the impact of cafe, pub and restaurant closures. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of interlinkage between high street hospitality and shops. Nottingham is going to face that, as all tier 3 will.‚Äù

In a normal year the nine stainless steel fermenting vessels at the Castle Rock brewery near the city‚Äôs train station would be full, ahead of the expected peak in demand during the festive season. This December they are empty.

‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas‚Äô: Colin Wilde, MD of Castle Rock brewery in Nottingham. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas,‚Äù said the managing director, Colin Wilde. The brewer and pub operator has 22 sites in Nottingham and across the east Midlands, all in tier 3.

The company now offers takeaway alcohol from its brewery and pubs, but it brings in less than 10% of normal trade, and Wilde said the closed pubs ‚Äúleak cash‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a sector, we feel like canaries in a cage. It feels like politicians are testing things out on the hospitality sector and don‚Äôt think it matters if it dies.‚Äù JP",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
798,No 10 and regulator contradict Hancock's 'because of Brexit' Covid vaccine claim,[],"Both Downing Street and the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator have contradicted a claim by Matt Hancock that Brexit helped the UK become the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus.

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK‚Äôs decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. ‚ÄúWe have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,‚Äù said June Raine, the MHRA‚Äôs chief executive.

Timeline UK Covid-19 restrictions: the key political dates ahead Show Hide Here are some of the key dates ahead for the UK's Covid-19 restrictions. The current lockdown in England ends, and the new strengthened tier system comes into force with nearly 99% of England headed for the strictest two tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day ‚Äì decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs‚Äô approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock‚Äôs stated view, Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

‚ÄúI think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,‚Äù he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it‚Äôs obviously incredibly positive news.‚Äù

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat job of working with the company to look at that data as it‚Äôs come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would‚Äù.

Hancock continued: ‚ÄúThe second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

‚ÄúWe do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they‚Äôre done because of Brexit.‚Äù

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing ‚Äúfast and loose with the facts‚Äù over the vaccine. The party‚Äôs health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim ‚Äúis not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look‚Äù.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock‚Äôs department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA‚Äôs ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as ‚Äúpart of wider conversations‚Äù about the MHRA‚Äôs lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA‚Äôs role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

800,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from Ant√≥nio Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: ‚ÄúHumanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back ‚Äì and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes ‚Ä¶ Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.‚Äù

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) ‚Äì which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible ‚Äì and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

‚ÄúMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,‚Äù he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. ‚ÄúIt must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. ‚ÄúThis is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test ‚Ä¶ We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.‚Äù

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable ‚Äì even in rich countries ‚Äì were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Ni√±a weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: ‚ÄúI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year ‚Äì the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.‚Äù

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to ‚Äúflick the green switch‚Äù while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days‚Äô time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: ‚ÄúWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.‚Äù

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. ‚ÄúNext year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,‚Äù he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. ‚ÄúThere is no vaccine against climate warming,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúBut there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.‚Äù

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

‚ÄúMoney, money, money,‚Äù said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. ‚ÄúThe question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.‚Äù

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK‚Äôs spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host‚Äôs leverage in bringing developing countries together.

‚ÄúA country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
801,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"An alleged ‚Äúbribery for pardon‚Äù scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered ‚Äúa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence‚Äù.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the ‚Äúbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äù, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the ‚Äúsubject or target‚Äù of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. ‚ÄúPardon investigation is Fake News!‚Äù he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‚Äòbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äô is.‚Äù

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro tweeted: ‚ÄúIn 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day ‚Äì but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a ‚Äúpre-emptive pardon‚Äù. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives‚Äô intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt presume ‚Äì and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

‚ÄúIt may be someone that we‚Äôve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.‚Äù

803,'I saw people dying on the road': Tigray's traumatised war refugees,[],"When Ethiopia‚Äôs army shelled Humera, a small agricultural city in Tigray, in mid-November, 54-year-old Gush Tela rushed his wife and three children to safety in a nearby town.

A few days later, he felt compelled to find out what had become of his home. As he approached the city on his motorbike, riding through the arid countryside, he said the stench of countless dead bodies filled the air.

Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said.

‚ÄúI saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,‚Äù Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.‚Äù

Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia‚Äôs prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region‚Äôs ruling party, the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies.

Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents ‚Äì and who was responsible.

On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia‚Äôs government had signed a deal to allow ‚Äúunimpeded‚Äù humanitarian access to Tigray ‚Äì at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people.

Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. ‚ÄúI was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never felt this situation would ever happen.‚Äù



Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba.

Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces.

At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia‚Äôs governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency.

About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted.

Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies.

Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost two crisis on top of each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.‚Äù

Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility.



Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù Tigrayans.

The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes.



Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia.

For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. ‚ÄúIt was very successful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.‚Äù

Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. ‚ÄúBut those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,‚Äù he said.

With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet.

He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we‚Äôre serving 200 patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of drugs every time, so we‚Äôre using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.‚Äù

Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. ‚ÄúRespiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.‚Äù

Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. ‚ÄúWe were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,‚Äù he said.

Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren‚Äôt accessing treatment.

Women‚Äôs reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap.

Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray‚Äôs leadership.

Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias.

804,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc‚Äôs chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as ‚Äúderisory‚Äù by Downing Street.

On the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

‚ÄúBarnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rush?‚Äô‚Äù said one senior EU diplomat. ‚ÄúAmbassadors for every country bordering the UK ‚Äì 11 all in all ‚Äì raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.‚Äù

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. ‚ÄúThe EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,‚Äù a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in ‚Äúembryo‚Äù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

An EU diplomat said: ‚ÄúWe are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

‚ÄúAs we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.‚Äù

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe‚Äôs coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

A source said: ‚ÄúFish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.‚Äù

David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament‚Äôs Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year.

He tweeted: ‚ÄúWe are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

805,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain‚Äôs hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,‚Äù he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI want to make sure we‚Äôre going to fight like hell by investing in America first.‚Äù He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America‚Äôs domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden‚Äôs priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his ‚Äúgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China‚Äôs abusive practices ‚Äì that‚Äôs stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations‚Äù and forcing ‚Äútech transfers‚Äù from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. ‚ÄúThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our ‚Äì or at least what used to be our ‚Äì allies on the same page. It‚Äôs going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.‚Äù

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.‚Äù He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal ‚Äúwith the nuclear programme‚Äù.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. ‚ÄúAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,‚Äù he said.

Then, Biden added: ‚ÄúIn consultation with our allies and partners, we‚Äôre going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran‚Äôs nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.‚Äù He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal ‚Äì France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China ‚Äì to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
806,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja‚Äôi Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband‚Äôs aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: ‚ÄúThe procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.‚Äù

The UN said he had been ‚Äúreportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process‚Äù and then ‚Äúforced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras‚Äù.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilm√®s, Belgium‚Äôs deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to ‚Äúdiscuss consular issues‚Äù on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

Wilm√®s also condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last Friday. Iran claimed on Thursday to have identified the individuals responsible for bringing weapons into the country, but gave no details.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
807,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation‚Äôs special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada‚Äôs so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada‚Äôs elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

The Canadian soldiers took horrific ‚Äútrophy‚Äù photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada‚Äôs own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada‚Äôs defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette ‚Äì who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take ‚Äì said that in Canada‚Äôs case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking at the experience that we had, where there were ‚Ä¶ war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn‚Äôt think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it‚Äôs actually worked out.‚Äù

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

‚ÄúIn a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn‚Äôt seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,‚Äù Collenette said.

He said Canada‚Äôs approach ‚Äì disbandment coupled with major organisational reform ‚Äì has been ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù.

No Canadian government ‚Äì conservative or liberal ‚Äì has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

‚ÄúIt was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we‚Äôd fought in world wars, and we‚Äôd never had anything like this.‚Äù

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

‚ÄúEven when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,‚Äù Collenette said. ‚ÄúWe did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it‚Äôs 25 years after the fact.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
808,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has condemned the behaviour of MEP J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Sz√°jer‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúWhat our representative, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,‚Äù said Orb√°n on Wednesday evening. He said Sz√°jer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orb√°n‚Äôs government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Sz√°jer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary‚Äôs constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium‚Äôs coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Sz√°jer‚Äôs resignation. ‚ÄúHe made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,‚Äù it read.

Prior to Orb√°n‚Äôs intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

‚ÄúMr Sz√°jer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,‚Äù said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Sz√°jer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region‚Äôs deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him ‚Äúfleeing along the gutter‚Äù to escape the raid.

Sz√°jer admitted he had been at a ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Sz√°jer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Sz√°jer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. ‚ÄúI always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something ‚Äì just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,‚Äù he said. He added that guests had been ‚Äúcompletely naked‚Äù at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Sz√°jer for possession of drugs. But the ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Sz√°jer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Sz√°jer boasted that he had drafted Hungary‚Äôs new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as ‚Äúa 21st-century constitution‚Äù when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Sz√°jer said: ‚ÄúIt depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don‚Äôt think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.‚Äù

In the intervening decade, Orb√°n‚Äôs government has gone further in its ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orb√°n‚Äôs government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, ‚Äúthe mother is a woman and the father is a man‚Äù. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government‚Äôs justification for the amendment explained that ‚Äúnew, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development‚Äù.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Sz√°jer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making ‚Äúa huge political deal out of a sex scandal‚Äù and praised Sz√°jer‚Äôs statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary‚Äôs government.

809,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 13 and a half months over protest,[],"The high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong will spend more than a year in jail over an unauthorised protest outside police headquarters in June last year, a court in the city has ruled.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong‚Äôs recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

‚ÄúThe court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court‚Äôs view, made the case more serious,‚Äù the judge said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: ‚ÄúEveryone hang in there, add oil,‚Äù using a phrase of encouragement meaning ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: ‚ÄúI will hang in there.‚Äù

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù in his stomach, according to a post on the activist‚Äôs social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday‚Äôs sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted ‚Äúanother blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong‚Äù.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. ‚ÄúI urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,‚Äù he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong‚Äôs arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù and described it as ‚Äúanother example of HK authorities targeting activists‚Äù.

Wong has maintained a defiant approach during the court case, saying last week: ‚ÄúI am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.‚Äù

He also urged people to focus on the plight of the ‚ÄúHong Kong 12‚Äù, the detained group accused of attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat in August. They have been held in a mainland detention centre ever since, with their families accusing authorities of denying the group access to lawyers, visitors, or medical treatment.

Chow, who gave up her British citizenship to run in Hong Kong elections, was one of the first Demosisto politicians barred from standing for office because the party advocated ‚Äúself-determination‚Äù.

One of her most successful roles has been bringing international attention to Hong Kong‚Äôs democracy movement, aided by her fluency in English, Cantonese and Japanese. She built a huge social media following in Japan in particular. Chow was arrested in August under the national security law, on the vague suspicion of ‚Äúcolluding with foreign forces‚Äù.

At least 31 people have been arrested under the national security law imposed by Beijing in late June, which outlaws a broad range of acts as sedition, secession, foreign collusion, and terrorism.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
810,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"Zineb Redouane, 80, was closing her shutters during gilets jaunes protest when she was fatally injured

France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat'

A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

French police weapons under scrutiny after gilets jaunes injuries Read more

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim‚Äôs daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother‚Äôs death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: ‚ÄúDirect fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.‚Äù

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had ‚Äúfractures of the entire right hemifacial bone‚Äù. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim‚Äôs chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane‚Äôs apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded ‚Äúthe weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police‚Äù. It added: ‚ÄúThere is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired‚Äù, and concluded the grenade had ‚Äúhit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection‚Äù.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that ‚Äúthere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas‚Äù. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

‚ÄúThere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,‚Äù the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: ‚ÄúIt was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.‚Äù

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. ‚ÄúShe was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,‚Äù Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

‚ÄúThe police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.‚Äù

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

‚ÄúThis is a political issue. It‚Äôs important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

‚ÄúMr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.‚Äù

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by ‚Äúscientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts‚Äù who had examined the ‚Äúangle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,‚Äù he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
811,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November‚Äôs presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

‚ÄúNot a day goes by where there‚Äôs not a crowd outside,‚Äù Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump‚Äôs election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù was Giuliani‚Äôs response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani‚Äôs 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business‚Äôs branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

‚ÄúThis is a construction yard, that‚Äôs a liability,‚Äù Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

‚ÄúIt did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‚ÄòWho knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?‚Äô‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians‚Äô incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

‚ÄúI gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a ‚ÄúPowerBall‚Äù number of 10 were the South African national lottery‚Äôs winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (¬£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

‚ÄúCongratulations to tonight‚Äôs 20 winners of PowerBall draw,‚Äù the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThese numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.‚Äù

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

‚ÄúLotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,‚Äù posted one Twitter user. ‚Äú20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,‚Äù ventured another. ‚ÄúAbsolutely no way in hell that‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma‚Äôs nine-year tenure.

South Africa‚Äôs National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review ‚Äúand if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that‚Äù.

813,Trump lawyer: ex-election security chief Krebs should be 'taken out and shot',[],"A former head of US election security who said Donald Trump‚Äôs defeat by Joe Biden was not subject to voter fraud should be ‚Äútaken out at dawn and shot‚Äù, a Trump campaign lawyer said.

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a ‚Äúmob attorney‚Äù.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump‚Äôs claims, ‚Äúwas the most secure in American history‚Äù.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit ‚Äì and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

‚ÄúAnybody who thinks the election went well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.‚Äù

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to ‚Äúundermine democracy ‚Ä¶ to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people‚Äù.

Trump called that interview ‚Äúridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke‚Äù.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president‚Äôs disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump‚Äôs legal team was ‚Äútalking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I‚Äôve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre going to have to be dealt with politically. It‚Äôs the only way you deal with these people.‚Äù

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden‚Äôs win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThreats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It‚Äôs behavior befitting a mob attorney.‚Äù

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made ‚Äúa retaliatory threat involving Krebs‚Äô official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351‚Äù.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and DiGenova should ‚Äúface disbarment at least‚Äù.

Trump‚Äôs comments appeared to acknowledge that he thought he could have lost the election. While speculation about a presidential run in 2024 has been rife, and many US politics watchers expect him to declare a bid soon, he has not spoken publicly about it before.

The video was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee of the party, Pam Pollard, who is national committee member for the Oklahoma GOP. The footage showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks. Coughing could be heard.

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors ‚Äì violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president‚Äôs aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady‚Äôs spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, ‚Äúwhile providing the safest environment possible.‚Äù She said that would include smaller guest lists, that ‚Äúmasks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending the parties will be a very personal choice,‚Äù she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

‚ÄúIf the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,‚Äù Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms‚Äô content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a ‚Äúmust-pass‚Äù because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won‚Äôt agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

Joe Biden, the US president-elect, formally introduced his top economic advisers on Tuesday, as his incoming administration prepares to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Bipartisan group pitches $908bn Covid-19 relief to break deadlock in Congress Read more

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to create a recovery for everybody,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúOur message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he ‚Äúmight have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical‚Äù about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúLost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American tragedy and it‚Äôs essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world‚Äôs population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths ‚Äì more than 268,000 ‚Äì with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: ‚ÄúThe team I‚Äôm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.‚Äù

His ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: ‚ÄúReward hard work in America, not wealth. It‚Äôs time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It‚Äôs time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.‚Äù

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Neera a long time,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.‚Äù

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that‚Äôs dumb.‚Äù

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders‚Äôs 2020 campaign, tweeted: ‚ÄúEverything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.‚Äù

For Biden, Tuesday‚Äôs sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump‚Äôs false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden‚Äôs victory, meaning Trump‚Äôs legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

The electoral college, which selects the president based on state-by-state results, is scheduled to meet on 14 December. Biden will take office on 20 January.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
816,Wisconsin and Arizona certify Biden wins in yet another blow to Trump,[],"Joe Biden‚Äôs victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump‚Äôs longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden‚Äôs nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

‚ÄúToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,‚Äù Wisconsin‚Äôs governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.‚Äù

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden‚Äôs lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin‚Äôs Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.‚Äù

Kaul noted that Trump‚Äôs recount targeted only the state‚Äôs two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. ‚ÄúI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn‚Äôt a game of gotcha.‚Äù

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state‚Äôs 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden‚Äôs overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump‚Äôs legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden‚Äôs narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

Arizona‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

‚ÄúWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,‚Äù Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election ‚Äúwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona‚Äôs laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary‚Äù.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump‚Äôs lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the ‚Äúgreatest scam ever perpetrated against our country‚Äù. When he mentioned Ducey‚Äôs name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of ‚Äúrushing to sign‚Äù papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: ‚ÄúArizona won‚Äôt forget what Ducey just did.‚Äù

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.‚Äù

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone‚Äôs ringtone for calls from the White House is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

Trump‚Äôs denials of political reality have left him increasingly isolated as a growing number of Republicans acknowledge the transition and Biden moves ahead with naming appointments to his administration.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.

Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS‚Äôs 60 Minutes programme on Sunday: ‚ÄúThere is no foreign power that is flipping votes.

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

818,Mexico: L√≥pez Obrador says pandemic lockdowns are the tactic of dictators,[],"Mexicos‚Äôs President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador suggested on Wednesday that politicians who impose lockdowns or curfews to limit Covid-19 are acting like dictators.

The comments came as L√≥pez Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask, saying it was a question of liberty.

The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people‚Äôs movements are ‚Äúfashionable among authorities ‚Ä¶ who want to show they are heavy-handed, dictatorship.

‚ÄúA lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúthe fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty.‚Äù

L√≥pez Obrador‚Äôs comments came a day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Mexico was ‚Äúin bad shape‚Äù with the pandemic and urged its leaders to take the coronavirus seriously.

‚ÄúThe number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,‚Äù said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In his commments on Wednesday, it was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries, or the mainly opposition-party local leaders in Mexico.

Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes, something L√≥pez Obrador has fiercely resisted doing, arguing some people live day-to-day on what they earn on the streets.

Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement, which resulted in scandals of abusive behavior by police.

L√≥pez Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary.

‚ÄúEveryone is free. Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so,‚Äù L√≥pez Obrador said.

The Mexican government has gone against the grain of international anti-virus practices in two ways. It has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks, and has described mass testing as wasteful and pointless.

Mexico has seen almost 107,000 test-confirmed deaths so far, the fourth-highest toll in the world, but Mexico does relatively little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is closer to 150,000.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

It said the pandemic had already triggered ‚Äúunprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour‚Äù and warned of a new wave of criminal activity ‚Äúin relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs ‚Äúplan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives‚Äù, the Interpol secretary general, J√ºrgen Stock, said.

‚ÄúIt is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of ‚Äúunauthorised and falsified‚Äù coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

820,France will carry out border checks to stop skiers from spreading Covid,[],"France will carry out random border checks over the holiday season targeting French skiers on their way to and from foreign resorts ‚Äì particularly Switzerland and Spain ‚Äì where slopes stay open, the prime minister, Jean Castex, has said.

‚ÄúThe goal is to avoid French citizens getting contaminated. That will be done by performing random checks at the borders,‚Äù Castex told French television, adding that returning holidaymakers would be ordered to quarantine for seven days.

While Alpine resorts in France will technically be open over Christmas, ski lifts and other essential winter sports infrastructure, as well as bars and restaurants, will not as the country strives to avoid fuelling a third wave of the coronavirus.

Italy and Germany share the French position and have indicated, to the fury of many local businesses, that their pistes will remain in effect closed over the Christmas and new year periods, which can account for up to 20% of some resorts‚Äô income.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, last week joined Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in calling for a Europe-wide shutdown of winter sports until 10 January.

Coronavirus clusters in Alpine resorts such as Austria‚Äôs Ischgl played a key role in the spread of the virus during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, with holidaymakers bringing Covid-19 back home following ski trips abroad.

Austria also said on Wednesday that while skiing could resume on 24 December, lift capacity would be limited, bars, restaurants, and hotels would remain largely closed until January, and people entering the country from abroad would have to quarantine.

The measures in effect mean skiiing will only be possible over the holiday season for locals who live close to the slopes. The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it should be possible ‚Äúfor a large part of our population to go skiing at least for the day‚Äù.

Conte asked Italians not to take to the slopes at all during the Christmas holidays, and called on all other European countries with major winter sports sectors to agree common rules to prevent cases being imported if Italy‚Äôs pistes stayed closed.

‚ÄúIt will not be possible to allow winter sports holidays this year, we cannot afford it,‚Äù the Italian prime minister said, arguing that despite a strict safety protocol devised by operators, ‚Äúeverything revolving around holidays on the snow is uncontrollable‚Äù.

Switzerland and Spain, however, have so far proved reluctant to impose restrictions. The Swiss interior minister, Alain Berset, said last week the country was ‚Äúautonomous. We can decide for ourselves whether we leave ski areas open. But we know what‚Äôs at stake.‚Äù

The Swiss government is expected to formally announce its position on limiting foreign visitors on Friday, while the Spanish government is still consulting with its autonomous regions on what measures to take.

Castex said on Wednesday that Switzerland and Spain were ‚Äúnot thus far falling into line‚Äù, but that ‚Äúdiplomatic action is continuing ‚Äì the die has not been completely cast‚Äù. He said he would continue ‚Äúto protect my fellow citizens by preventing them from going to contaminate themselves‚Äù, adding that the French measures were also ‚Äúabout being fair to French resort managers‚Äù.

One French resort, Ch√¢tel in the Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area, has draped Swiss flags around the village in protest against France‚Äôs stance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem with a French government that shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,‚Äù the mayor, Nicolas Rubin, said.

Macron had indicated on Tuesday that the French government was considering taking ‚Äúrestrictive and dissuasive measures‚Äù to prevent the French from going abroad to ski, especially in Switzerland, over the holiday period.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said this week that the risk of catching Covid-19 while actually skiing was minimal. ‚ÄúI suspect many people won‚Äôt be infected barrelling down the slopes on their skis,‚Äù he said.

But he said the real risks ‚Äúare going to come at airports, tour buses taking people to and from ski resorts, ski lifts ... and places where people come together‚Äù. The WHO was advising all countries to ‚Äúlook at their ski season‚Äù, he said, warning that indoor socialising after skiing might pose a particular threat.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that ‚Äúthe scientists have done it‚Äù, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with ‚Äúover-optimism‚Äù, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.‚Äù

There were still ‚Äúimmense logistical challenges‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúSo it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it‚Äôs all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we‚Äôre not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.‚Äù

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning‚Äôs press conference announcing the vaccine‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAnd what a momentous ‚Ä¶ journey and international effort it has been,‚Äù Van-Tam said. ‚ÄúDiscovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.‚Äù

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. ‚ÄúIf we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‚ÄòOh, the vaccine‚Äôs here, let‚Äôs abandon caution,‚Äô all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.‚Äù

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a ‚Äúcomplex product‚Äù and ‚Äúreally tricky to handle‚Äù, explaining: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.‚Äù

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was ‚Äúgoing to eradicate coronavirus ever‚Äù, but we may get to the point where it becomes ‚Äúa seasonal problem‚Äù like flu. He added: ‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us,‚Äô like the end of the war? No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

822,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to ‚Äúsure and certain knowledge that we will succeed‚Äù after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel ‚Äúquite emotional‚Äù.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected ‚Äì including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions ‚Äì it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

‚ÄúBecause of Brexit, we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,‚Äù Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK ‚Äì and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law ‚Äì but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,‚Äù he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid ‚Äúoveroptimism‚Äù and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England‚Äôs lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

‚ÄúIt will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,‚Äù he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it‚Äôs going to be with humankind forever,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us!‚Äô like the end of the war?

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt. I think those kind of habits, that we‚Äôve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ‚Ä¶ on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called ‚Äúa real cause for concern‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,‚Äù he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said ‚Äúeveryone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut‚Äù in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.‚Äù

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

‚ÄúThis authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
823,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own ‚Äúrobust‚Äù approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, contrasting the UK approach with the ‚Äúpace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly‚Äù.

The EMA said the bloc‚Äôs member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the ‚Äúappropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens‚Äô access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns‚Äù.

Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. ‚ÄúWe have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.‚Äù

The EMA‚Äôs statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included ‚Äúessential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign‚Äù.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation ‚Äúare not expected to affect significantly vaccines‚Äô availability‚Äù. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. ‚ÄúIn years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity‚Äôs charge against this disease,‚Äù he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: ‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don‚Äôt think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.‚Äù

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: ‚ÄúWe may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.‚Äù

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: ‚ÄúIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.‚Äù

824,Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans,[],"Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a ‚Äúsuper-spreader event‚Äù.

The gathering, called ‚ÄúNaughty in N‚Äôawlins‚Äù saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event‚Äôs organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

‚ÄúIf I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,‚Äù Hannaford wrote.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.‚Äù

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N‚Äôawlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

‚ÄúWhen we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,‚Äù Hannaford said.

‚ÄúIn almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‚ÄòFuck it, it‚Äôs our last day‚Äô and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.‚Äù

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

‚ÄúWe did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‚ÄòNo Dancing‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn‚Äôt really outlaw dancing.

‚ÄúBut seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

825,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan‚Äôs Princess Mako ‚Äì the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne ‚Äì and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom‚Äôs mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan‚Äôs royals; it has also brought the country‚Äôs succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro‚Äôs mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako‚Äôs father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

‚ÄúI approve of them getting married,‚Äù he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. ‚ÄúThe constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.‚Äù

But, he added, Komuro‚Äôs family needed to make a ‚Äúvisible‚Äù response to his mother‚Äôs financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I don‚Äôt think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]‚Äù ‚Äì adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor‚Äôs daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan‚Äôs succession laws, no female member of the imperial family ‚Äì not even the emperor‚Äôs 19-year-old daughter, Aiko ‚Äì can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako‚Äôs younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other ‚Äúirreplaceable‚Äù, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as ‚Äúsomeone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
826,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it‚Äôs been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK‚Äôs first female prime minister?

It‚Äôs a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council‚Äôs controversial decision to underwrite a ¬£100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: ‚ÄúWe find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúShe was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country‚Äôs has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.‚Äù

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long hard road. There‚Äôs been a few knocks and bumps along the way,‚Äù Schonhut said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see things finally coming to fruition.‚Äù

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit like a mini Brexit,‚Äù she said. She hopes it‚Äôll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . ‚ÄúIn the area we‚Äôre living in we‚Äôre seeing a huge number of homeless people, we‚Äôre seeing food banks springing up all over the place.‚Äù

Burgess added that given Thatcher‚Äôs controversial legacy it was a ‚Äúpoorly judged decision‚Äù to push ahead with the statue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.‚Äù

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

‚ÄúI appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it‚Äôs a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.‚Äù

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. ‚ÄúThe first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
827,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, ‚Äúa lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?‚Äù Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry ‚Äì but rarely their male counterparts ‚Äì have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt find a mother as appealing‚Äù. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had ‚Äúunderestimated this whole mommy thing‚Äù.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry‚Äôs disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children‚Äôs perspective on her last album (‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre going but you don‚Äôt say how long for / You say it‚Äôs work, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US ‚Äúnearly tore me apart‚Äù, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds ‚Äì leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms ‚Äì moving from the ‚Äúfemale pop star‚Äù category to the even more restrictive ‚Äúmum‚Äù box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

‚ÄúI hardly ever get asked about being a father,‚Äù says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter‚Äôs future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly‚Äôs Tom Fletcher ‚Äì whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I‚Äôm a Celebrity ‚Ä¶ contestant Giovanna Fletcher ‚Äì says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

‚ÄòWe knew we could have a support structure‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Thurston Moore and daughter Coco in 1995. Photograph: John Zich/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another human being.‚Äô So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.‚Äù Hot Chip‚Äôs Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children ‚Äúget upset when I am about to go away‚Äù, they ‚Äúunderstand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not only their own family‚Äôs financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for ‚Äì their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to let anyone down by saying, ‚Äòit would be great to do that festival, but we can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt,‚Äô‚Äù he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. ‚ÄúI think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it‚Äôs our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.‚Äù

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician‚Äôs living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by ‚Äúspeeding back during the night‚Äù after shows, and then ‚Äúdoing the school run in the morning‚Äù. Do his peers see that as normal? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúThey think that‚Äôs mad!‚Äù Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives‚Äô respective due dates, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a band, people expect to see you on stage,‚Äù says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,‚Äù he later said. Fletcher ‚Äì who had his first child ‚Äútwo weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career‚Äù ‚Äì was equally untroubled by the experience. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.‚Äù

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. ‚ÄúAbout 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live ‚Äì we drove our family car with him,‚Äù he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife‚Äôs mother) travelled ‚Äúall around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe‚Äù, an undertaking he describes as ‚Äúpretty easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot too hectic‚Äù.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth‚Äôs huge success during the decade: ‚ÄúWe made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.‚Äù Any earlier ‚Äúwould have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. ‚ÄúEveryone was there to give us everything we needed.‚Äù

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. ‚ÄúThe only person who would ever do that is a band‚Äôs manager and they might say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs going to impact on our finances‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù says Goddard. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.‚Äù The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. ‚ÄúHot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,‚Äù Goddard says. ‚ÄúThe band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.‚Äù Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules ‚Äúpretty challenging‚Äù, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out‚Äù.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of ‚Äúmum guilt‚Äù ‚Äì the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children ‚Äì men have the much milder husband guilt. ‚ÄúMy worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,‚Äù says Spearman, with Goddard adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have ‚Äì my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn‚Äôt have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.‚Äù

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,‚Äù says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn‚Äôt mind him taking paternity leave, ‚Äúif a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that‚Äôs different.‚Äù Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop ‚Äì ‚Äúthere are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older‚Äù ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúthe hormones, what happens to your body‚Äù that men don‚Äôt experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don‚Äôt have any children: ‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt really get those questions: ‚ÄòAre you going to settle down and have a child?‚Äô Women must be asked about it all the time.‚Äù When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. ‚ÄúI would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‚ÄòI probably will have some kids.‚Äô‚Äù

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon‚Äôs work ‚Äúwas going to be interrupted‚Äù. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be focused, but it‚Äôs also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It‚Äôs not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.‚Äù Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact ‚Äì albeit only temporarily. ‚ÄúHaving a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything ‚Äì what my daughter would think in years to come.‚Äù

Little monsters of rock ‚Ä¶ Ozzy Osbourne with son Jack, 1985. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.‚Äù Ghetts says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood‚Äôs cool, fatherhood‚Äôs sick‚Äù.

Goddard is more ambivalent. ‚ÄúMy coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.‚Äù Spearman says Everything Everything didn‚Äôt want to mention fatherhood ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in the press release for their new album, ‚Äúbecause it makes us look a bit old. And it‚Äôs a bit of cliche to be like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve written a record about having a kid,‚Äô which is not what our record is about. We don‚Äôt want to overstate it.‚Äù

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven‚Äôt noticed any real-world implications yet. ‚ÄúWe got playlisted on Radio 1,‚Äù he says happily. ‚ÄúNot bad for a dad band!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
828,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite ‚Äì it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It‚Äôs the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I‚Äôve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I‚Äôve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali‚Äôs fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis‚Äô days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone‚Äôs view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn‚Äôt show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I‚Äôd show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn‚Äôt have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy ‚Äì most photographers don‚Äôt hang around the magazine‚Äôs photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn‚Äôt mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali‚Äôs head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali‚Äôs next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you‚Äôd ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there ‚Äì I went with him once. They‚Äôd wind him up saying: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!‚Äù He‚Äôd reply: ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôd have had him in two rounds!‚Äù

I can count on one hand the athletes I‚Äôve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson‚Äôs disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist‚Äôs ear ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We‚Äôd do a studio shot and he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you 20 minutes‚Äù ‚Äì then an hour later he‚Äôd still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better ‚Äì maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I‚Äôve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

829,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. ‚ÄúTo come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,‚Äù he said.

Watt‚Äôs photographs of the forest ‚Äì and the grim aftermath of logging ‚Äì are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the ‚Äúgraveyard of stumps‚Äù in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we‚Äôre allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people are shocked that that‚Äôs still happening here. It‚Äôs not illegal. The government sanctions it.‚Äù

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province‚Äôs southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island‚Äôs original old growth forests ‚Äì where Watt shot his before-and-after series ‚Äì are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) ‚Äì or about 1% of the deferred areas ‚Äì is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,‚Äù said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. ‚ÄúThat means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.‚Äù

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep taking these ‚Äòbefore‚Äô photos,‚Äù said Watt. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs up to politicians if there‚Äôs going to be an ‚Äòafter‚Äô shot.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
830,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan‚Äôs Netflix epic. Firstly, it‚Äôs just as well The Crown isn‚Äôt on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation‚Äôs enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman‚Äôs Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia ‚Äì not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there‚Äôs nothing. Well, there‚Äôs Prince Charles but Josh O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons‚Äô Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn‚Äôt so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen‚Äôs children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana‚Äôs arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù on offer. It‚Äôs a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts ‚Äì for example, there‚Äôs no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II‚Äôs sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn‚Äôt they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling ‚Äì which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed ‚Äúfairytale‚Äù wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it‚Äôs simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there‚Äôs no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures ‚Äì such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II‚Äôs successor refusing to sign a bill into law ‚Äì or mined Britain‚Äôs deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV‚Äôs Victoria and BBC/Showtime‚Äôs The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you‚Äôre watching. In the latest series, there‚Äôs a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew ‚Äì then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal ‚Äì talks to the Queen about his private life. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù she later reflects to her husband. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt change ‚Ä¶‚Äù The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function ‚Äì and the aesthetics ‚Äì of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple‚Äôs courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4‚Äôs comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show‚Äôs writers have recognised that she doesn‚Äôt belong in that world ‚Äì a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it‚Äôs obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there‚Äôs a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic ‚Äì the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period ‚Äì the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there‚Äôs a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan‚Äôs withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations ‚Äì of royals and commoners alike ‚Äì might well wonder whether it‚Äôs all worth it.

831,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you‚Äôre going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They‚Äôve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It‚Äôs too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That‚Äôs fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs not right. They‚Äôve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don‚Äôt have all the best words to do this because I‚Äôm angry. And the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job ‚Ä¶ in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he‚Äôs one of the better ones they‚Äôve got. His family‚Äôs getting harassed now. There‚Äôs a noose out there with his name on it, and it‚Äôs just not right.

I‚Äôve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It‚Äôs just wrong. I can‚Äôt begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

Mr President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We‚Äôre investigating, there‚Äôs always a possibility, I get it. You have the rights to go to the courts. What you don‚Äôt have the ability to do ‚Äì and you need to step up and say this ‚Äì is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed, and it‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs not right ‚Ä¶ all of this is wrong.

DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former US attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better. Mr President, as the secretary said yesterday, people aren‚Äôt giving you the best advice of what‚Äôs actually going on on the ground. It‚Äôs time to look forward. If you want to run for re-election in four years, fine ‚Äì do it. But everything we‚Äôre seeing right now, there‚Äôs not a path. Be the bigger man here, and step in. Tell your supporters: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be violent. Don‚Äôt intimidate.‚Äù All that‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs un-American.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
832,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government‚Äôs ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It‚Äôs both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I‚Äôve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I‚Äôm torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year‚Äôs Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn‚Äôt going to stop transmission. It‚Äôs best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you‚Äôre likely to smell the smoke. It‚Äôs the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area ‚Äì the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you‚Äôre not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they‚Äôre not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government‚Äôs decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn‚Äôt worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I‚Äôm less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
833,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two | Adrian Chiles",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever ‚Äúour‚Äù is and whenever that ‚Äúday‚Äù might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: ‚ÄúOh God, we‚Äôre doing anarchism at the moment ‚Äì it‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism‚Äôs central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there‚Äôs a T-shirt slogan there, I‚Äôm sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father‚Äôs wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. ‚ÄúOf course she wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening‚Äôs source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter‚Äôs adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

‚ÄúHow are you doing, Ryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù he said happily. ‚ÄúLiving the dream.‚Äù

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself ‚Äúto the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active‚Äù. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a ‚Äúmisconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There‚Äôs definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we‚Äôve got a few Thatcherites in our class.‚Äù

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren‚Äôt born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs everything, isn‚Äôt it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.‚Äù Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this ¬£17,000-a-year establishment, she said: ‚ÄúThere were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I‚Äôve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.‚Äù No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that‚Äôs quite a start. ‚ÄúThings have deteriorated quite significantly since then,‚Äù he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it‚Äôs never like that.‚Äù

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of ‚Äúreal‚Äù politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it ‚Äúinteresting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.‚Äù

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view ‚Äì or those of your tribe ‚Äì and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: ‚ÄúNothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.‚Äù

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

834,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it | Editorial,[],"There is a job of public reassurance ahead that will be made harder if partisanship and ministerial grandstanding get in the way

When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday‚Äôs news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours ‚Äì a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn‚Äôt really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government‚Äôs proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone ‚Äì regardless of nationality or political affiliation ‚Äì is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
835,The Guardian view on Poland‚Äôs Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Krak√≥w, Marek Jƒôdraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the European Union‚Äôs Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù clause, Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a ‚Äúneo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God‚Äôs kingdom‚Äù. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender ‚Äúideology‚Äù in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October‚Äôs controversial abortion ruling by Poland‚Äôs constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops‚Äô conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS‚Äôs leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, called on Poles to ‚Äúdefend the church at any price‚Äù. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church‚Äôs authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II‚Äôs judgment was criticised in last month‚Äôs Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope‚Äôs secretary, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church‚Äôs steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczy≈Ñski, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to ‚Äúabandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance‚Äù. Their statement denounced attempts to ‚Äúexploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party‚Äù. If the country‚Äôs ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
836,Covid has shown me what lies beyond boredom: post-boredom,[],"I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. ‚ÄúGood, thanks. You?‚Äù I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. ‚ÄúWhat did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, umm ‚Ä¶ got really into jigsaws for a bit. Rearranged the spare room into an office. Learned to make this one really good curry recipe from the BBC website. Uh ‚Ä¶ got 11 solo wins and about 24 duo wins on Fortnite.‚Äù Is that good?, they‚Äôll ask, and I‚Äôll have to admit that no, not particularly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game for 12-year-olds that I play compulsively,‚Äù I‚Äôll explain. ‚ÄúEvery day I log in and let adolescents embarrass me in an online world that allows them to dance joyously on the remains of my corpse.‚Äù Oh, they‚Äôll say. I think there‚Äôs something ‚Äì I think there‚Äôs something happening in the other room. I really ought to‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs important to address the fact that I am bored. I am, to my bones, bored of this. I know that in the current climate, being bored is a high luxury, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any more thrilling. In fact, I am so deep into boredom that I have burrowed beneath the previously accepted boundaries of the concept, and have now emerged, apathetically, into post-boredom.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a ‚Äúsign of a life falling apart‚Äù to something I was doing ‚Äúfor the moral good of the country and the world as a whole‚Äù, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I‚Äôd thrive in the ambient boredom of prison ‚Äì not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I‚Äôd get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That‚Äôs not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one ‚Äì no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing ‚Äì but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it‚Äôs psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it‚Äôs possibly even worse that we‚Äôve worn boredom down to the bone. If we‚Äôve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself ‚Äì someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something ‚Äì the answer can only be ‚Äúchaos‚Äù.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won‚Äôt be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much ‚Äì stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it‚Äôs hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We‚Äôre all tiptoeing around the idea that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It‚Äôs hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I‚Äôm certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

837,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we‚Äôve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world‚Äôs human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We‚Äôve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some ¬£1.5bn of the UK‚Äôs commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it‚Äôs coming under threat from the government‚Äôs proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don‚Äôt yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map ‚Äì it‚Äôs also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged ¬£7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world‚Äôs most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested ¬£12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed ¬£120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network‚Äôs priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We‚Äôve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, ‚ÄúAntimicrobial resistance ‚Ä¶ threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily‚Äù. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK‚Äôs track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government‚Äôs decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

838,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you‚Äôve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of ‚ÄúDivine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.‚Äù

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn‚Äôt include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for those who haven‚Äôt seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit ‚Äì it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there ‚Äì but somehow it didn‚Äôt really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone‚Äôs accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%‚Äôs mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren‚Äôt one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It‚Äôs weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on ‚Äì giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
839,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found the game cathartic",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix‚Äôs series The Queen‚Äôs Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I‚Äôd ever played anyone, I‚Äôd lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I‚Äôm more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I‚Äôd never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it‚Äôs exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I‚Äôve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other ‚Äì sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny‚Äôs funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they‚Äôd ever known.

But it isn‚Äôt always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny‚Äôs escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was ‚Äì he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I‚Äôd been playing chess for a few months ‚Äì first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online ‚Äì I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I‚Äôd started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He‚Äôs the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It‚Äôs a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

841,The Crown ‚Äì fact or fiction? - podcast,[],"Royal correspondent Jennie Bond, who has covered some of the most dramatic years of the monarchy, discusses whether The Crown is an accurate depiction of palace life

On Sunday, the culture secretary said he planned to write to Netflix and ask that a ‚Äúhealth warning‚Äù be played before The Crown ‚Äì an historical drama depicting life inside the palace ‚Äì so viewers would be aware the show was a work of fiction. Oliver Dowden worried that viewers would not be able to distinguish fiction from fact.

845,Fans are back! But avoid using toilets during peak times,[],"THE RETURN OF PROPER FOOTBALL

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage ‚Äúfootball without fans is nothing‚Äù is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we‚Äôd either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we‚Äôd have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven‚Äôt done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn‚Äôt it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid ‚Äúunnecessary movement‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, without having to purchase a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal‚Äôs poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we‚Äôll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language. The Fiver is very much looking forward to it.

846,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC‚Äôs decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúverification‚Äù from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

‚ÄúThe shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,‚Äù a BBC spokesperson said. ‚ÄúOn this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.‚Äù

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

‚ÄúThis is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I‚Äôve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don‚Äôt vote.‚Äù

Fury‚Äôs initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury‚Äôs team offered a farmer ¬£25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4 ‚Äî TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 2, 2020

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements ‚Äì citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury‚Äôs team to lie. Fury‚Äôs subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as ‚Äútotal bullshit‚Äù.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury ‚Äì who earlier that year had claimed that ‚Äúthere are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.‚Äù

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn‚Äôt changed his mind. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy it one bit,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hamilton, who won the award in 2014 and has finished in the top three a record five times, is as short as 1-7 with the bookmakers after winning his seventh F1 title.

Fury, who retained his WBC heavyweight title by knocking out Deontay Wilder, is the second favourite, slightly ahead of O‚ÄôSullivan, who won his sixth world title at the Crucible.

Doyle, who broke her own record for the number of winners ridden by a British woman in a year in 2020, said she was delighted at being shortlisted.

‚ÄúIt is a huge privilege to be nominated for such an illustrious award,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to get my head around being nominated alongside the likes of Lewis Hamilton, but I‚Äôm really pleased that horse racing has been recognised alongside these sports.‚Äù

The 24-year-old, who also rode her first Royal Ascot winner and became the first woman to ride five winners on the same card at odds of 899-1 at Windsor in August, said: ‚ÄúRacing can be in its own little bubble as such, so hopefully this might help to open the door to a wider audience.‚Äù

848,"Mick Schumacher's family name is blessing and a curse, says Damon Hill",[],"Damon Hill has said Mick Schumacher deserves his shot at Formula One success but has warned the son of the seven-times world champion Michael that living up to a family name can be both a blessing and a curse.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill‚Äôs father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher‚Äôs F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

‚ÄúThere is a sense that some people don‚Äôt want you to have a go,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI felt like some people felt: ‚ÄòWhy is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.‚Äô It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.‚Äù

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

‚ÄúI wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad‚Äôs life and career and applied them to my racing.

‚ÄúJacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.‚Äù

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

‚ÄúIt really is tragic what happened to Michael,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.‚Äù

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

‚ÄúI have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.‚Äù

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher‚Äôs best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

‚ÄúIn a way it‚Äôs very simple ‚Äì if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
849,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed ‚Äúill-judged criticism‚Äù from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been ‚Äúconvicted of racism‚Äù.

Porto‚Äôs move came after City drew 0-0 at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as ‚Äúan opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism‚Äù.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: ‚ÄúHis tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.‚Äù

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto‚Äôs coach Sergio Concei√ß√£o accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Concei√ß√£o described Silva as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù for a tweet that followed City‚Äôs victory in which the midfielder wrote: ‚ÄúThis one felt so good!‚Äù

Porto‚Äôs newsletter claimed Guardiola had a ‚Äúbad disposition after the meeting‚Äù on Tuesday and quoted Concei√ß√£o as saying: ‚ÄúI would also be upset if I couldn‚Äôt win with the team he has and the budget he has.‚Äù

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: ‚ÄúDespite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt buy class or notion.‚Äù In response a City spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

‚ÄúIn 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.‚Äù

The incident referred to came at the Drag√£o in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City‚Äôs XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: ‚ÄúStrange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn‚Äôt going to work. Clearly selective memory, I‚Äôm sure them receiving a fine for targeting Mario in 2012 just a memory.‚Äù

850,LeBron James' $88m contract extension opens possibility of playing alongside son,[],"LeBron James, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to their first NBA title in a decade earlier this year, has agreed a two-year contract extension worth $88m, opening the possibility of him playing in the league at the same time as his son.

James‚Äôs agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James‚Äôs contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year‚Äôs NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

853,'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration,[],"Spanish archipelago has received 20,000 migrants and refugees this year, 8,000 in the last month

'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration

In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus.

The streets of Arguinegu√≠n, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon.

Almost 15 years after the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees.

Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018.

Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguinegu√≠n. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguinegu√≠n, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309.

The people held at the temporary centre ‚Äì officially for a maximum of 72 hours ‚Äì are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms.

There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents.

Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system.

Spain‚Äôs public ombudsman has called for the Arguinegu√≠n camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people‚Äôs basic rights.

Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mog√°n, of which Arguinegu√≠n is a part.

Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island‚Äôs capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay.

While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will.

‚ÄúThis lack of humanity from the government just can‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.‚Äù

And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù in 2006.

Jos√© Segura Clavell, who was the central government‚Äôs representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the ‚Äúhumanitarian reception‚Äù to which they are entitled.

If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs behaviour is a mistake,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a clear common policy.‚Äù

The lack of a clear, common ‚Äì and fair ‚Äì approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU‚Äôs new migration and asylum proposals.

‚ÄúWe believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,‚Äù the four countries said.

‚ÄúThe frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.‚Äù

In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguinegu√≠n dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people ‚Äì including more than 455 unaccompanied children ‚Äì are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mog√°n.

But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that ‚ÄúMog√°n‚Äôs solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December‚Äù and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere.

The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after.

‚ÄúIf I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,‚Äù Jalloul said on Thursday.

‚ÄúDo you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?‚Äù

Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry ‚Äì which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible ‚Äì says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks.

Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October ‚Äúin search of a future‚Äù. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister.

But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home.

Kamara says the Canaries ‚Äì ‚Äúa great place‚Äù ‚Äì remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off.

‚ÄúI was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,‚Äù says Kamara.

Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with.

The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain.

For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp ‚Äújust goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago‚Äù.

Like many others ‚Äì not least the regional president of the Canaries ‚Äì Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, ‚Äúviews island territories as prisons‚Äù.

But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries.

In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into.

‚ÄúUntil we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we‚Äôre going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,‚Äù says Santana.

‚ÄúThere will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
854,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain‚Äôs new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her ‚Äúdelight, after many years of campaigning,‚Äù that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens‚Äô right to work and live in UK ‚Äì a key Brexit ask ‚Äì or British nationals‚Äô right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

‚ÄúIt will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,‚Äù said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. ‚ÄúI built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is ‚Ä¶ a shock.‚Äù

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell‚Äôs mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and ‚Äì like his sister ‚Äì two dual-nationality children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very settled; we have careers and families,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not thinking of going home yet.‚Äù

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. ‚ÄúMy big worry is my mother,‚Äù Frizell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fit and well, but if she needed looking after ‚Ä¶ Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now ‚Äì but not for much longer.‚Äù

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, ‚Äúalmost without restriction‚Äù.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù Godfrey said, ‚Äúif you want to come back with your non-British partner, you‚Äôll need to earn ¬£18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they‚Äôll have to meet the new points system.‚Äù

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs ‚Äì NHS surcharges, fees ‚Äì could run into thousands of pounds.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a massive change,‚Äù said Godfrey. ‚ÄúIt basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it‚Äôs asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible choice, and it‚Äôs really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.‚Äù

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. ‚ÄúThe government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.‚Äù

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. ‚ÄúThe government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúWe just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we‚Äôre not talking about a never-ending stream of people ‚Äì it‚Äôs a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It‚Äôs just nonsense.‚Äù

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home ‚Äì and if we don‚Äôt move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It‚Äôs hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.‚Äù

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship ‚Äì but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

‚ÄúIf we wanted to move back we‚Äôd have to go through so many hoops now,‚Äù Woodford said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not sure we‚Äôd meet the minimum income. It‚Äôs seems unfathomable to me ‚Ä¶ Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.‚Äù

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband ‚Äúcould not possibly decide by March 2022‚Äù whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

Fay Castling, Greece. Photograph: handout

‚ÄúBut how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years ‚Äì she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that‚Äôs been taken away.‚Äù

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

‚ÄúBrexit means I can‚Äôt do that now, because I don‚Äôt yet have a full residence permit, so I can‚Äôt leave Greece for more than three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that‚Äôs not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.‚Äù

The couple would be ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. ‚ÄúIt just seems so sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people‚Äôs choices taken away ‚Äì all those things my generation could do ‚Ä¶ And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.‚Äù

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

‚ÄúDaniel may want to come back ‚Äì not yet, certainly, but at some stage,‚Äù Barbara said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn‚Äôt look very fair or equal to me.‚Äù

855,"'If the EU says we can‚Äôt open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni‚Äôs grandmother Adelina began the family‚Äôs ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

‚ÄúI have never not known a ski season,‚Äù said Di Bendinoni. ‚ÄúEven the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.‚Äù

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Gernot Bl√ºmel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

‚ÄúIn Italy we‚Äôre in limbo, when you don‚Äôt know what will happen from one day to the next,‚Äù said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni‚Äôs cousin and a ski instructor. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians ‚Äì if the EU says we can‚Äôt open, then they should pay for it.‚Äù

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy‚Äôs third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d‚ÄôOulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgen√®vre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about ‚Ç¨11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere‚Äôs inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

‚ÄúSome got ‚Ç¨600, others ‚Ç¨1,200,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don‚Äôt discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt carry on. We‚Äôre at that level and politicians need to understand.‚Äù

Gianni Poncet, the village‚Äôs mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,‚Äù Poncet said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants ‚Äì across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn‚Äôt begin we will lose ‚Ç¨1bn.‚Äù

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular apr√®s-ski spot, said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.‚Äù

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

‚ÄúEven if people from abroad can‚Äôt come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,‚Äù Giovanni Brasso said. ‚ÄúIn the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.‚Äù

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves ‚Ä¶ and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan‚Äôs parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan‚Äôs soldiers reached the settlement‚Äôs outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

‚ÄúWe expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,‚Äù Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. ‚ÄúNobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,‚Äù Safaryan says.

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

‚ÄúWhen we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúEven after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äô It never happened.‚Äù

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

‚ÄúI was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,‚Äù she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. ‚ÄúGeographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.‚Äù

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. ‚ÄúArmenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúWe had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn‚Äôt trustful coexistence.‚Äù

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. ‚ÄúI asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLater we learned it was about unification with Armenia.‚Äù

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. ‚ÄúWe said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúWe even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.‚Äù

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. ‚ÄúSlowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúOne day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,‚Äù Hajiyeva recalls. ‚ÄúAfter that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.‚Äù

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. ‚ÄúI opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,‚Äù she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúMy parents just woke up and realised war had begun.‚Äù

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. ‚ÄúSome days they couldn‚Äôt even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúThey were very bad, very harsh days.‚Äù

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan‚Äôs favour.

‚ÄúThe whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,‚Äù she claims. ‚ÄúThey left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.‚Äù

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh‚Äôs Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan‚Äôs parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. ‚ÄúThey are just existing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what we are going to do.‚Äù

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúSome people were saying, why have you left your city?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.‚Äù

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. ‚ÄúThe house has survived the occupation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what‚Äôs happening in my city.‚Äù

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. ‚ÄúMy friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always prepared myself that once I‚Äôll be back in Shusha, I‚Äôll start my new life from zero.‚Äù

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. ‚ÄúI cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,‚Äù Hajizada said. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.‚Äù

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm nobody now,‚Äù Safaryan says.

857,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel‚Äôs parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday‚Äôs vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz‚Äôs Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday‚Äôs bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country‚Äôs longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

‚ÄúNetanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,‚Äù Gantz said. ‚ÄúShow me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: ‚ÄúNetanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.‚Äù

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. ‚ÄúNow is not the time for elections,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúNow is the time for unity.‚Äù

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu‚Äôs ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

‚ÄúI was well aware of his track record as a ‚Äòserial promise-breaker‚Äô, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gantz said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúNetanyahu didn‚Äôt lie to me ‚Äì he lied to all of you.‚Äù

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,‚Äù Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

‚Äú[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,‚Äù wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

‚ÄúThe key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?‚Äù Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important ‚Äúnew blood‚Äù in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äì who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president‚Äôs interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats ‚Äì including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù was not about mere words but a ‚Äúdemand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country‚Äù.

Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) We lose people in the hands of police. It‚Äôs not a slogan but a policy demand. And centering the demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country gets us progress and safety. https://t.co/Vu6inw4ms7

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a ‚Äòslogan‚Äô,‚Äù said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge ‚Äì ultimately unsuccessfully ‚Äì the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs seat in the November election.

Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) We didn‚Äôt lose Breonna because of a slogan.



Instead of conceding this narrative, let‚Äôs shape our own. It‚Äôs time we listen to the people, organize and build coalitions around our own message, and cast a vision that inspires us all to lead for change at the ballot box and beyond. https://t.co/mBg7wanaR6

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù was ‚Äúnot a slogan. It‚Äôs a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Mr President ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about losing people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We‚Äôre losing our loved ones to police violence.‚Äù

The Black Lives Matter movement member‚Äôs rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police ‚Äì a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health ‚Äì factors that contribute to crime.

The former president‚Äôs comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) Damn, Mr. President.



Didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúTrayvon could‚Äôve been my son?‚Äù



In 2014, #BlackLivesMatter was too much.



In 2016, Kaepernick was too much.



Today, discussing police budgets is too much.

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden‚Äôs flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

‚ÄúIf you instead say ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs reform the police department so that everybody‚Äôs being treated fairly,‚Äô‚Äù Clyburn offered alternatively. ‚ÄúNot just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?‚Äô‚Äù

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

‚ÄúShe speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,‚Äù he said, adding that across political ideologies ‚Äúnew blood is always good‚Äù for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
859,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, ‚Äúproductivity score‚Äù, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators ‚Äúhelp their people get the most‚Äù from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

‚ÄúAt Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,‚Äù Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe also believe that privacy is a human right, and we‚Äôre deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.‚Äù

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren‚Äôt contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. ‚ÄúGoing forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level ‚Äì providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,‚Äù Spataro says. ‚ÄúNo one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. ‚ÄúProductivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,‚Äù Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern workforce transformation‚Äù unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

‚ÄúThe thing I love most about Microsoft is that when we screw up, we acknowledge the error and fix it,‚Äù Snover tweeted. ‚Äú10,000 thanks to Wolfie Christl and others for the feedback which led to this change!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
860,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don‚Äôt count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor‚Äôs note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board ‚Äúeroded the public trust in legitimate service animals‚Äù.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people ‚Äúfraudulently representing their pets as service animals‚Äù, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog‚Äôs health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can‚Äôt bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned ‚Äúpit bull type dogs‚Äù in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, ‚ÄúAt this time, there are no changes to Delta‚Äôs current service and support animal policies.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
861,"Covid could derail efforts to eradicate malaria in Pacific, health experts warn",[],"The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

‚ÄúThere are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.‚Äù

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

‚ÄúBut it is malaria that can explode the fastest ‚Äì it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‚Äòcanary in the coalmine‚Äô that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.‚Äù

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia‚Äôs interest.

And a similar proportion ‚Äì 56% ‚Äì believe that if Australia doesn‚Äôt support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

‚ÄúAs a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.‚Äù

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

‚ÄúAustralians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours ‚Ä¶ indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.‚Äù

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia ‚Äúshould these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs‚Äù.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia‚Äôs vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

‚ÄúDoes Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?‚Äù national director Sam Klintworth wrote. ‚ÄúThis equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.‚Äù

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should ‚Äúexplicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia‚Äù.

Last month, a panel of UN public health experts urged governments not to hoard vaccine supplies and called on pharmaceutical companies to share technologies and expertise so all countries can access treatments equally.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
862,Oligarch's son flees to Russia as mother sues over 'hidden' divorce millions,[],"The son of a billionaire Russian oligarch who is being sued by his mother over claims he helped hide hundreds of millions of pounds due to her in the UK‚Äôs biggest ever divorce settlement has fled to Russia.

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad‚Äôs ‚Äúlieutenant‚Äù in a scheme to hide up to ¬£453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a ¬£30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was ‚Äústressed and scared‚Äù about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister‚Äôs home in Russia.

‚ÄúI got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams ‚Ä¶ harassing me. I‚Äôm drinking a lot,‚Äù he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I was on the streets ‚Ä¶ [But] I‚Äôm not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúnot hiding‚Äù in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings ‚Äúway in excess‚Äù of the ¬£3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that ¬£3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter‚Äôs mother had become accustomed. ‚ÄúNow maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it‚Äôs different,‚Äù he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her ¬£453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the ¬£30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son‚Äôs emails.

Akhmedova‚Äôs legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband‚Äôs ¬£300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club‚Äôs owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

863,"Strictly dropped us after we asked to be paid, say musicians",[],"A group of professional musicians have said they were dropped by Strictly Come Dancing after they asked to be paid for performing on the programme‚Äôs spinoff show.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day‚Äôs work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have money in the budget to pay for contributors.‚Äù Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a ‚Äúdecent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name‚Äù, which would help boost the band‚Äôs following on Instagram and Facebook.

‚ÄúHopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,‚Äù they were told by the show‚Äôs producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians‚Äô Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: ‚ÄúThe days of ‚Äòit‚Äôll give you exposure‚Äô (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won‚Äôt get any gigs these days and we won‚Äôt sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production ‚Ä¶ They want us and our expertise, but they won‚Äôt pay for it.‚Äù

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: ‚ÄúLike all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven‚Äôt raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven‚Äôt monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

‚ÄúWe do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than ¬£20,000 a year, is a pittance.‚Äù

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly‚Äôs hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: ‚ÄúExternally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.‚Äù

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: ‚ÄúAs we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn‚Äôt happen for editorial reasons.‚Äù

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: ‚ÄúHad they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
864,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste‚Äôs fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share ¬£12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured and privileged and I‚Äôm going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.‚Äù

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery‚Äôs story as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

‚ÄúToday the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

‚ÄúHowever, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

‚ÄúBernard Collaery‚Äôs story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers‚Äô lawyers are now being targeted.‚Äù

Collaery and Witness K‚Äôs cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to ¬£3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at ¬£3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a ¬£770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a ¬£3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

Shares in G4S rose 7.5% to 246p on Wednesday .

G4S investors now have until 16 December to decide whether they want to accept GardaWorld‚Äôs final offer.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‚ÄúG4S management have been pushing back for some time against GardaWorld; however, with Allied Universal Security also lurking in the background, G4S shareholders are likely to find this new offer compelling, especially since the shares are up over 50% since the initial September bid.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
866,Nike Japan ad on teenage bullying and racism sparks debate,[],"A video made by Nike Japan that explores bullying and racism using three schoolgirl footballers has sparked praise and outrage online, including calls to boycott the company‚Äôs products.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù and beautiful,‚Äù but others were less impressed.

While the film‚Äôs message clearly riled members of Japan‚Äôs online right ‚Äì many of whom commented using pseudonyms ‚Äì more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

‚ÄúIs Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you‚Äôre creating a false impression of Japan,‚Äù said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: ‚ÄúNowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that‚Äôs prejudiced is Nike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so much fun to blame Japan?‚Äù another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country‚Äôs multiracial rugby team at last year‚Äôs world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn‚Äôt Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the ‚Äúzainichi problem‚Äù ‚Äì a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are ‚Äústaying in Japan‚Äù.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world‚Äôs highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka‚Äôs sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she ‚Äúlooked sunburned‚Äù and ‚Äúneeded some bleach‚Äù.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThe pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,‚Äù said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

‚ÄúAlas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of zombie energy.‚Äù

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: ‚ÄúWith governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year‚Äôs devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,‚Äù said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (¬£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world‚Äôs fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we‚Äôre beginning to see that happen,‚Äù said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: ‚ÄúWorking together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.‚Äù

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: ‚ÄúGovernments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies ‚Äì this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we‚Äôre going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.‚Äù

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to ‚Äúshow climate leadership‚Äù by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: ‚ÄúThe world ‚Äì and its people ‚Äì are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
868,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‚Äòone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äô and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called ‚Äúone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äù.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised ‚Äúthe devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire‚Äù.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the ‚Äúalarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity‚Äù including the decline in New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and MƒÅori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must ‚Äúact with urgency‚Äù.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

‚ÄúThis declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.‚Äù

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service‚Äôs buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the ‚Äúsignificant progress on meeting the challenge‚Äù by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation ‚Äì which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äì made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and had become ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. ‚ÄúThe irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.‚Äù

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: ‚Äú[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs declaration also said the government will ‚Äúdemonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government‚Äôs own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025‚Äù.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs all very well to declare an emergency but there‚Äôs no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,‚Äù Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government‚Äôs fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation‚Äôs biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand‚Äôs pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
869,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world‚Äôs coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world‚Äôs biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries ‚Äì Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal ‚Äì will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction ‚Äì known as exclusive economic zones ‚Äì are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.‚Äù

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: ‚ÄúAustralians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods ‚Ä¶ When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.‚Äù

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world‚Äôs oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was ‚Äúa really big deal‚Äù and could restore the health of the world‚Äôs oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

‚ÄúWhat you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it‚Äôs not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant ‚Äì business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe oceans are in a very sorry state right now.‚Äù

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.‚Äù

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: ‚ÄúIf we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.‚Äù

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world‚Äôs oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of ‚Äúghost‚Äù fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a ‚Äúcircular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik √ñsterblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: ‚Äú[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.‚Äù

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world‚Äôs oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ‚ÄúThe UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
870,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing ‚Äì a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other‚Äôs perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls ‚Äì meaning that they push their joypad‚Äôs thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen ‚Äì the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not per se a topic we‚Äôd study in our lab, we‚Äôd had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,‚Äù explains Corbett. ‚ÄúThis was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.‚Äù

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? ‚ÄúGenerally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúThere are no right or wrong answers in these tasks ‚Äì we‚Äôre interested in how people might perform differently. We‚Äôll obtain one or two measures ‚Äì for example, average reaction time, average accuracy ‚Äì from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.‚Äù

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual‚Äôs visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. ‚ÄúFor example,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.‚Äù

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúMost research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can‚Äôt really process more than a few details at once. There‚Äôs a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.‚Äù

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what‚Äôs on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

‚ÄúSuch findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‚Äòreal‚Äô flight consoles,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúIn a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.‚Äù

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

‚Ä¢ Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

871,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace ‚Äì review,[],"Queen‚Äôs Gallery, London There‚Äôs an entire wall of Rembrandts in here, not to mention magnificent works by Vermeer and Rubens. But these treasures should be on show to everyone all the time

Some of the greatest paintings in Britain ‚Äì and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens ‚Äì all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don‚Äôt ‚Äì because, obviously, they weren‚Äôt allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen‚Äôs pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art ‚Äì and this collection ‚Äì to HM using the term ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù. This old school art snob would no more have said ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù than he‚Äôd have said ‚Äútaken to Twitter‚Äù. He‚Äôd have said ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù or ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen‚Äôs Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection‚Äôs finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I‚Äôve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt‚Äôs rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam‚Äôs Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar‚Äôs anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he‚Äôs studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They‚Äôre consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Consciously posing ‚Ä¶ Rembrandt‚Äôs Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / ¬© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I‚Äôll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It‚Äôs hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here‚Äôs the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He‚Äôd recently lost his wife. A friend ‚Äì thought to be William, Lord Crofts ‚Äì is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck‚Äôs mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer‚Äôs surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they‚Äôre in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It‚Äôs either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens‚Äôs personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There‚Äôs a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi‚Äôs Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show ‚Äì she painted it for Charles I ‚Äì and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection‚Äôs virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I‚Äôm grateful that some of the royal family‚Äôs treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It‚Äôs hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

I‚Äôm an Australian comedian who normally lives in London, but I‚Äôve ended up unexpectedly trapped in New Zealand this year on my way back to Australia. Well, as much as you can be trapped in one of the safest places in the world.

I‚Äôve spent most of 2020 walking around in the woods alone in the day, and scrolling through the internet to check the rest of the world is still there at night. It‚Äôs been nice but I am probably getting a bit of a Jack Torrance vibe.

London and New Zealand are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I haven‚Äôt been home to Australia in years and by now I‚Äôm homesick enough that I‚Äôd probably fall to my knees at the mere waft of a sausage. In the spirit of patriotism, I‚Äôve quarantined this list to the Aussie corner of the internet. (Full disclosure, these internet people are all my real-life friends, but at the moment this is the only way I get to see them too.)

1) This sketch from Mad as Hell that I wish was for a real show

‚ÄòThis country is facing an existential crisis.‚Äô

Writing on Mad As Hell was one of the best jobs I‚Äôve ever gotten to do and I miss working with the team and cast. I‚Äôve really loved watching how they tackled 2020 restrictions and I‚Äôm extremely glad that they were allowed to keep producing the show this year. This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

Engineering numbers.

Speaking of Mad As Hell, Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews are two of the best sketch writers I‚Äôve ever gotten to work with. This is the intro clip for their show MAGMA, which you can go and watch on demand here https://sospresents.com/ along with other incredible Australian comedians like Double Denim and Jude Perl.

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‚ÄòI will just warn you before I go any further ...‚Äô

As a comic it‚Äôs hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She‚Äôs just so good.

4) Steve Irwin being bitten by a snake three seconds after he says it won‚Äôt bite

‚ÄòThe only reason I‚Äôm doing this is because this one‚Äôs a python ...‚Äô

The only not-stand-up clip that I‚Äôve included. The snake has impressive comic timing considering it‚Äôs a snake. Steve Irwin is such a gentleman with beautiful manners. Take a moment to appreciate the dedication of the puppeteer and the host‚Äôs brave gaze. I don‚Äôt know what else you could want.

5) Danielle Walker‚Äôs joke about her grandad‚Äôs grave

‚ÄòHe calls it his man grave.‚Äô

Probably one of the bits I try and retell badly to people the most. Sorry for butchering it at dinner parties, Danielle.

6) This clip from Kirsty Webeck

‚ÄòI had a little nibble.‚Äô

Kirsty has such a delightful energy. This clip was a nice surprise 2020 treat the other week when it came through my feed.

7) Alice Fraser

‚ÄòA bit testerical are we?‚Äô

Alice has a plethora of amazing comedy available online, but this is a great intro if you haven‚Äôt seen her work before. The punchline count in this four and a half minutes is genuinely incredible.

8) Jude Perl‚Äôs Hungry and Horny

‚ÄòProudly brought to you by ...‚Äô

Jude is just plain talented. If I‚Äôm ever having a bad day I put on her albums for an instant boost.

9) Jack Druce ‚Äì just Jack Druce in general

‚ÄòSay what you will about a single bed ...‚Äô

Jack is the most unique joke writer I can think of and I really love his work. It was pretty hard to select my favourite clip so I really recommend watching the full show on his channel. He‚Äôs also got a great newsletter that you can‚Äôt see on the internet unless you sign up for it here.

873,Godmothered review ‚Äì Disney remixes Enchanted ‚Ä¶ minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There‚Äôs the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles ‚Äì swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

It‚Äôs impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney‚Äôs 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor‚Äôs career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland‚Äôs closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams‚Äôs Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there‚Äôs winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom ‚Äì Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor‚Äôs preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor‚Äôs self-centered ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù feels earned. But Godmothered‚Äôs tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother‚Äôs overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there‚Äôs one ‚Äì co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) ‚Äì within reach), but its shoehorned revelation ‚Äì that true loves comes in many forms ‚Äì is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious ‚Äì unrealistic in the parts where it‚Äôs trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor‚Äôs misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a bumpy, underwhelming ride ‚Äì not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
874,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world ‚Äì it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‚ÄòLast night,‚Äù says Laima Leyton, ‚ÄúI went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramoviƒá. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn‚Äôt have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.‚Äù

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists ‚Äì Leyton among them ‚Äì about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly‚Äôs condemnation of petty domesticity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall‚Äù ‚Äì and Tracey Emin‚Äôs oft-quoted line: ‚ÄúThere are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.‚Äù

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,‚Äù painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer‚Äôs wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report‚Äôs data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that‚Äôs not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists‚Äô careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn‚Äôt factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world ‚Äì motherhood. My resulting essay ‚Äì Full, Messy and Beautiful ‚Äì was published alongside this year‚Äôs report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

‚ÄúMy experience,‚Äù Anna Perach told me, ‚Äúis that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‚Äòsold out‚Äô or joined the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.‚Äù

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with ‚Äúthe holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids‚Äù, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can‚Äôt be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn‚Äôt come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn‚Äôt have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? ‚ÄúPaying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,‚Äù said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There‚Äôs now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities ‚Äì buzz, aura, image ‚Äì there is quite simply a problem of perception. ‚ÄúWomen artists are marginalised generally,‚Äù as Jemima Burrill put it. ‚ÄúMothers are almost beyond the pale.‚Äù

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are ‚Äì and have been ‚Äì great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù that a woman cannot excel as both.

875,"Faith review ‚Äì compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains ‚Äúwarrior monks‚Äù in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks‚Äô daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white ‚Äì it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn‚Äôt help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there‚Äôs no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions ‚Äì five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken ‚Äì to fuel his narcissism and ego, I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I‚Äôd like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

876,‚ÄòAs consumers we all have tremendous impact‚Äô: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we‚Äôre on if we‚Äôre to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you‚Äôre a climate science denier, you‚Äôll be familiar with ‚Äì and anxious to see something done about ‚Äì a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive ‚Äì going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚Äì the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it‚Äôs from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The ‚Äúnatural carbon storage‚Äù of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft‚Äôs target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it‚Äôs a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs a mindset,‚Äù says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. ‚ÄúWe decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We‚Äôre embracing the challenge.‚Äù

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations ‚Äì ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it‚Äôs the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion‚Äôs share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,‚Äô says Henkel‚Äôs Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company‚Äôs direct influence presents challenges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúTake our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can‚Äôt make you switch your energy supplier. But it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.‚Äù

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel‚Äôs global carbon footprint ‚Äì just 2% compared with Ikea‚Äôs 11%, for example ‚Äì the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.‚Äù

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites ‚Äì both thermal and photovoltaic ‚Äì any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company‚Äôs plans.

‚ÄúIf we have the right energy infrastructure in place ‚Äì similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montorn√®s del Vall√®s in Spain, for example ‚Äì we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,‚Äù says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory ‚Äì so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúToday, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It‚Äôs quite a dramatic progress.‚Äù Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: ‚ÄúThe classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it‚Äôs too easy to do right now.‚Äù Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. ‚ÄúThe capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,‚Äù Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. ‚ÄúWe have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,‚Äù says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: ‚ÄúOur products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers ‚Äì and ultimately consumers ‚Äì save energy and carbon.‚Äù

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. ‚ÄúYou, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúDo I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?‚Äù

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. ‚ÄúVideo-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,‚Äù says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. ‚ÄúLaundry won‚Äôt complain if you wash it cold, so that‚Äôs easier. Your clothes will last longer and your electricity bill will be lower,‚Äù says Bergmann, adding that decades of research has enabled Henkel to produce detergents that function at these lower temperatures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about generating a good value proposition ‚Äì the behavioural change will follow.‚Äù

For all the company‚Äôs good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat. The first step to combating this is having a clear breakdown of our own carbon footprints. ‚ÄúThis transparency enables us to make informed choices,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe all need to take gradual steps, rather than just seeing an overwhelming target that we‚Äôll struggle to achieve.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
877,‚ÄòThe holy grail of packaging recycling‚Äô: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there‚Äôs one thing the British public likes to complain about, it‚Äôs recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn‚Äôt, where it ends up and who‚Äôs paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn‚Äôt always straightforward. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really hard to identify what kind of material it is,‚Äù says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. ‚ÄúIf the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it‚Äôs covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,‚Äù he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it‚Äôs vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies ‚Äì essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‚ÄòThe objective is to increase farmer incomes‚Äô: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer‚Äôs bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. ‚ÄúThis means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,‚Äù says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it‚Äôs a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. ‚ÄúIt makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today‚Äôs problems in sorting and recycling packaging,‚Äù says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. ‚Äú[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.‚Äù

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product‚Äôs website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. ‚ÄúMaybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],‚Äù he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. ‚ÄúWe are in a very early pioneering phase,‚Äù he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. ‚ÄúEven with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.‚Äù

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold‚Äôs mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. ‚ÄúIt brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,‚Äù he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. ‚ÄúThis means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.‚Äù

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this testing to the next level.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. ‚ÄúI think it was my children,‚Äù he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. ‚ÄúAs they‚Äôve gotten older, they‚Äôve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.‚Äù

In the salon‚Äôs new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There‚Äôs a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He‚Äôs also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he‚Äôs already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there‚Äôs been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs added a real buzz to the salon,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú[Clients] feel they‚Äôre doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what‚Äôs going on [in the world].‚Äù

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. ‚ÄúA big turning point was David Attenborough‚Äôs The Blue Planet,‚Äù she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. ‚ÄúI had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green.‚Äô‚Äù

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than ¬£5,000 a year. ‚ÄúThere are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we‚Äôve found a lot of win-wins,‚Äù Baden says. ‚Äú[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients‚Äô behaviour. They‚Äôre connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.‚Äù

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai G√∂rlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel‚Äôs brands. ‚ÄúWe truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,‚Äù he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, G√∂rlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf‚Äôs Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children‚Äôs Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. ‚ÄúHairdressing is a skill, a craft ‚Äì it‚Äôs teachable,‚Äù Ellis says. ‚ÄúSo we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.‚Äù Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. ‚ÄúShe ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed my life.‚Äô It‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. ‚ÄúI felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.‚Äù Many will go on to set up their own businesses ‚Äì Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‚ÄúHe said that it‚Äôs such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,‚Äù G√∂rlitz says of Son. ‚ÄúIn 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.‚Äù And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, G√∂rlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel‚Äôs Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. ‚ÄúShaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.‚Äù

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he‚Äôs felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever, we‚Äôve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That‚Äôs incredible. There‚Äôs been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
879,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue ‚Äì its stickiness ‚Äì is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 ‚Äì the 2020 target is 60% ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind‚Äôs environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: ‚ÄúThe issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.‚Äù

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It‚Äôs things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes ‚Äì generally, anything that doesn‚Äôt spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. ‚ÄúIt costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn‚Äôt collect and sort it,‚Äù he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex‚Äôs goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK‚Äôs circular economy package ‚Äì an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value ‚Äì will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It‚Äôs all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we‚Äôll see a change for flexible packaging then. ‚ÄúWhen the EPR system is launched in 2023, we‚Äôre hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,‚Äù he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won‚Äôt be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time ‚Äì let‚Äôs say cardboard ‚Äì and also for plastics,‚Äù says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel‚Äôs projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. ‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?‚Äô He said he‚Äôd worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!‚Äù

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer ‚Äì often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec‚Äôs technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. ‚ÄúThe debonding allows you to recover more [materials],‚Äù Bankmann says. ‚ÄúIt will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.‚Äù

The adhesives developed with Saperatec‚Äôs recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel‚Äôs RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. ‚ÄúAs the targets go up and we‚Äôre increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,‚Äù he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
880,17 delicious loaf tin recipes (that aren‚Äôt banana bread),[],"A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost ¬£2 ‚Äì even the cheapest model will set you back about ¬£2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough ‚Äì about 900g.

So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity ‚Äì any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin ‚Äì some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner‚Äôs lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin ‚Äì and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.

A good place to start is plain old bread ‚Äì specifically, Dan Lepard‚Äôs sour cream sandwich loaf. While it is possible to knock up endless free-form, rustic loaves at home, the point of the tin is to make bread that in some way resembles the stuff you buy in a shop: sharp-cornered, sandwich friendly, toaster ready. Lepard‚Äôs method relies on a quick knead ‚Äì about 10 seconds ‚Äì repeated at 10 minute intervals, plus a final rise in the tin. In this, and in every recipe here, you would be wise first to line your tin with greaseproof paper, even if the loaf tin in question is non-stick. If you like living dangerously, feel free to ignore this warning and accept the consequences.

Claire Thomson‚Äôs porridge bread makes good use of leftover cold porridge, mixed in with the white flour. For a darker, gluten-free bread, Lepard offers multiseed and molasses bread. Besides molasses (or black treacle), the recipe requires a mix of potato starch, cornflour, rice flour, psyllium husk, egg white and a selection of seeds. But because there is no gluten, there is no need to knead: you end up with a sort of batter that firms itself up as it rises.

Loaf tins are not just for bread ‚Äì you can also use them to make loaf-shaped cakes, a pound cake being one of the best and simplest. Traditionally, pound cake contained a pound of each of the four main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs), but you don‚Äôt need a maths degree to realise that this would overwhelm a 2lb tin. Instead, try this recipe for vanilla pound cake, which calls for 200g of each (that means three eggs), along with a teaspoon of untraditional, but wholly welcome, baking powder.

Drizzle cake is another loaf tin standard. Felicity Cloake‚Äôs perfect version is a close relative to pound cake, with some ground almonds and lemon zest thrown in and, of course, the drizzle. Fergus Henderson‚Äôs seed cake, meanwhile, is one of the few dedicated elevenses recipes out there, best administered with a glass of something while lunch is still a distant prospect. The seed in question is caraway; the something should be madeira.

Rachel Roddy‚Äôs marmalade cake is yet another variation ‚Äì the proportions are the same as for pound cake, although the amounts here suggest a 1lb loaf tin may be a more suitable size. Tamal Ray‚Äôs blood orange syrup loaf is a gluten-free option, using polenta instead of flour. In an emergency, you could profitably employ regular oranges.

Ruby Tandoh‚Äôs blueberry loaf cake is made with yoghurt and almond oil (although she says sunflower oil, with a little added vanilla, works as a substitute). Delia Smith has a recipe for dark Jamaican gingerbread that will allow you to get more use out of that tin of black treacle or molasses you bought to make Lepard‚Äôs bread.

Your loaf tin can also serve as a mould for savoury dishes, most famously meatloaf. There are countless wildly different variations on this classic American dish and I have hit on a few bad ones while trying to recreate the kind my mother made. As ever, it is wisest to rely on Cloake‚Äôs definitive version: after some experimentation, she settles on a recipe containing, among other things, spinach, yoghurt, eggs, garlic, brown sugar and ketchup. If you are looking for something elementary ‚Äì and very much in the humble, no-nonsense spirit of the dish ‚Äì you could have a go at this five-ingredient meatloaf: mince, bacon, sage-and-onion stuffing mix, a beef stock cube and sunflower oil. If you don‚Äôt like the sound of that list, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt like meatloaf.

As far as I am concerned, a terrine tin and a loaf tin are the same thing ‚Äì if you have one, you have both. This means that as soon as you have turned out your bread you can use the tin to whip up a pat√© de campagne. Once again, I am passing on Cloake‚Äôs hard-won expertise, alongside a warning that this will amount to rather more than a lazy afternoon‚Äôs work. Plus, you may have to source some caul fat. Another option is this festive-sounding duck and pork terrine with cranberries and pistachios, which has the advantage of being rather easier to pull together.

A terrine need not be a savoury dish ‚Äì your loaf tin can give shape to all sorts of desserts and puddings. This coffee ice-cream terrine, for example, is made up of layers of coffee and vanilla ice-cream, cemented together with chocolate sauce and left to set hard in the freezer.

Chocolate caramel terrine is another layered pudding ‚Äì this time a caramel, mascarpone, chocolate and cream mixture interspersed with caramel wafers cut to fit your loaf tin. More impressive still is Liam Charles‚Äôs rhubarb and honey panna cotta terrine: a blondie biscuit base with rhubarb jelly on top and panna cotta in between. If you feel uncomfortable making something like that in the same loaf tin you used for meatloaf last week, then I am with you. Best to buy another one for desserts ‚Äì you can get them for about ¬£2.50.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
881,How to make cullen skink ‚Äì recipe,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there‚Äôs anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it‚Äôs the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it‚Äôs too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked ‚Äì to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it‚Äôs not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool ‚Äì take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums ‚Ä¶

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 ‚Ä¶ and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them unless they‚Äôre very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice ‚Äì small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink ‚Äì white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury‚Ä¶

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns ‚Äì steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
882,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she‚Äôd taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. ‚ÄúAnd then the next morning, I just went: ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going out.‚Äô‚Äù She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,‚Äù she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself ‚Äì making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

‚ÄúI started to get those feelings last week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible uneasiness. There‚Äôs this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there‚Äôs a feeling of complete hopelessness.‚Äù There are physical sensations, too ‚Äì her heart races, and she feels hot. ‚ÄúAnd just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.‚Äù Although it‚Äôs tough to experience, it is, she says, ‚Äúa godsend that I know what‚Äôs happening now‚Äù.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, ‚Äúthe usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out‚Äù. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious‚Äù.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we‚Äôre not around the people who might spot something is off ‚Äì our family, friends or colleagues ‚Äì and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

‚ÄòIf you are feeling very sad, you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment.‚Äô Photograph: LaylaBird/Getty Images

‚ÄúFor instance, if you are feeling very sad,‚Äù says Robinson, ‚Äúyou would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you‚Äôre not looking forward to anything in the future. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.‚Äù Instead, says Robinson, ‚Äúask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to‚Äù.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. ‚ÄúNormally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut everyone‚Äôs finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can‚Äôt concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?‚Äù

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we‚Äôre living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? ‚ÄúSo ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?‚Äù Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. ‚ÄúSo the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself ‚Äì and in a limited, more muted way than previously ‚Äì am I still able to motivate myself to see people?‚Äù

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. ‚ÄúAgain, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that‚Äôs a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúBut if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can‚Äôt get things done that need to get done, you can‚Äôt get the shopping in, you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat or you‚Äôre overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can‚Äôt function, these would be warning signs to seek help.‚Äù

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you‚Äôre being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and ‚Äúwhether people find that they‚Äôre excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That‚Äôs a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.‚Äù

‚ÄòAsk yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to.‚Äô Photograph: Christopher Hopefitch/Getty Images

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there‚Äôs a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.‚Äù

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about ‚Äúthriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there‚Äôs that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There‚Äôs more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there‚Äôs an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.‚Äù

The core symptoms of depression, he says, ‚Äúare a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that there‚Äôs definitely a mental health condition.‚Äù It‚Äôs when it becomes pervasive and has an ‚Äúimpact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we‚Äôre becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.‚Äù However, he points out, ‚Äúeverybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what‚Äôs normal for you?‚Äù

‚ÄòI found I wasn‚Äôt reading, and I thought: ‚ÄúThis is very odd.‚Äù‚Äô Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images (Posed by model)

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, ‚ÄúI found that suddenly I wasn‚Äôt reading and I thought: ‚ÄòThis is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?‚Äô I‚Äôd start and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a book.‚Äù A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the guitar since lockdown. It‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, but I can‚Äôt kind of get around to doing it.‚Äù During low periods, ‚ÄúI tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I‚Äôll find excuses why I can‚Äôt see them. So I know that I‚Äôve got to force myself to do something.‚Äù Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people ‚Äúand just be silly‚Äù, but obviously it hasn‚Äôt been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it‚Äôs not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise ‚Äì particularly walking ‚Äì works for her, ‚Äúand cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve failed again, you‚Äôre going back to where you were.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like: ‚ÄòNo, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.‚Äù She would seek help, she says, ‚Äúif it got to the point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage it myself‚Äù.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. ‚ÄúThe charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.‚Äù There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. ‚ÄúI would emphasise that it‚Äôs been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,‚Äù says Obuaya. ‚ÄúTherefore we shouldn‚Äôt make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they‚Äôve got a major mental health problem.‚Äù But, he stresses, there is ‚Äúa range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111. In the US, Mental Health America is available on 800-273-8255. In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978

883,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you‚Äôve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It‚Äôs most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, ‚Äúlife‚Äù is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I‚Äôve been targeted with ads for ‚Äúface yoga‚Äù, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize ‚Äì $25

Who doesn‚Äôt want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 ‚Äúreps‚Äù a day for 30 days. The beginners‚Äô version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you‚Äôve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a ‚ÄúChad‚Äù ‚Äì a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix ‚Äì $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No ‚Äì she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night‚Äôs sleep.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don‚Äôt suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn‚Äôt stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn‚Äôt to say such strips can‚Äôt be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don‚Äôt think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.‚Äù Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it‚Äôs no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it‚Äôs probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good ‚Äì the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you‚Äôve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

‚ÄúMy first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it‚Äôs not too expensive, it‚Äôs very reasonable to try.‚Äù

So can they work? ‚ÄúIn terms of its actual efficacy it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúReally, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.‚Äù However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth a shot‚Äù.

Upright Go 2 ‚Äì $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you‚Äôve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They‚Äôre right, of course, but it‚Äôs also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you‚Äôve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can‚Äôt roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I‚Äôd recommend it the most.

Manly app ‚Äì $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It‚Äôs simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly‚Äôs suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it‚Äôs been stuffed full of sausages.

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they‚Äôve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are. Meanwhile the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I‚Äôm quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you‚Äôre one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre ‚Äì like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people‚Äôs body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we‚Äôre all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it‚Äôs editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it‚Äôs something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
884,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an ‚Äúexclusively English environment‚Äù.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: ‚ÄúAmongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting ‚Ä¶ and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‚Äòcultural habit‚Äô of visiting ‚Ä¶ There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.‚Äù

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show‚Äôs presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country ‚Äì regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland‚Äôs peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

‚ÄúI found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit ‚Äì I imagine it was all three ‚Äì but it was tough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained ‚Ä¶ but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.‚Äù

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

‚ÄúI realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I‚Äôd come back feeling refreshed ‚Äì ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.‚Äù

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

‚ÄúPeople look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it‚Äôs consistently pointed out to you that you don‚Äôt fit in, or when you don‚Äôt see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn‚Äôt be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.‚Äù

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

‚ÄúPosting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it‚Äôs not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.‚Äù

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go ‚Äì her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and ‚Äúdoing something really physical‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,‚Äù she said.

I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

‚ÄúI needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn‚Äôt just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.‚Äù

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

‚ÄúMany people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside ‚Äì the last bastions of whiteness ‚Äì where it is even less diverse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.‚Äù

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton ‚Äì one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

‚ÄúThere are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.‚Äù

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in ‚Äúgrubby holiday homes‚Äù, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn‚Äôt and so it was kind of non-negotiable ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake ‚Äì we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSometimes I didn‚Äôt even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.‚Äù

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

‚ÄúWith swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you‚Äôve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents ‚Äì all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

‚ÄúThere are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
885,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a ‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is ‚Äútrust‚Äù. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life ‚Äì finances, work, household, even grooming ‚Äì so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that ‚Äúagreement‚Äù would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would ‚Äì how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent ‚Äì including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established ‚Äúswingers‚Äù community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

887,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a ‚Äúfertility specialist‚Äù in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City‚Äôs first women‚Äôs hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband‚Äôs sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm‚Äôs daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff‚Äôs office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn‚Äôt heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada‚Äôs doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families ‚Äì 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor‚Äôs treatments ‚Äì shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, ‚Äúthe idea of closure is really impossible,‚Äù Hannah Olson, the film‚Äôs director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how ‚Äúpainful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence‚Äù.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records ‚Äì birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives ‚Äì sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora‚Äôs box of secrets. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn‚Äôt the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn‚Äôt the person they thought he was,‚Äù she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized ‚Äì ‚Äúthis was a phenomenon.‚Äù

Baby God initially follows Babst‚Äôs personal investigation, as she retraces her mother‚Äôs steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier‚Äôs former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality ‚Äì a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable ‚Äì has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier‚Äôs previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. ‚ÄúI feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn‚Äôt violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,‚Äù he says in the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still struggling with that. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up.‚Äù

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. ‚ÄúAt first it was like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get all the facts, we‚Äôre going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,‚Äô‚Äù said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction ‚Äì one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier ‚Äì make the doctor‚Äôs deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù attitude, belief that women don‚Äôt need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn‚Äôt become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, ‚Äúwe ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,‚Äù said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film‚Äôs second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier‚Äôs two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline‚Äôs descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case‚Äôs larger, more unsettling questions. ‚ÄúLooking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it‚Äôs always been illegal. It‚Äôs battery, it‚Äôs malpractice, you can‚Äôt put something in someone‚Äôs body without their consent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTowards the end, it became about making peace with one‚Äôs parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?‚Äù The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a ‚Äúvery bizarre case‚Äù to ‚Äúilluminate something that may be universal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just trying to make peace with our parents.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
888,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It‚Äôs the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It‚Äôs now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it‚Äôs honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It‚Äôs a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum‚Äôs executive director.

‚ÄúEven though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,‚Äù said Horsford. ‚ÄúIt can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.‚Äù

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. ‚ÄúThey think, oh we‚Äôre in the north, that wasn‚Äôt an issue here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it‚Äôs a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.‚Äù

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. ‚ÄúPeople who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don‚Äôt say much more,‚Äù she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it‚Äôs a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

‚ÄúWe wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we‚Äôre talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,‚Äù adds Horsford. ‚ÄúWe never want to say: ‚Äòthese people were just slaves,‚Äô because there‚Äôs so much to the story than just that.‚Äù

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm‚Äôs former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

‚ÄúI wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today‚Äôs generations, are human,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.‚Äù

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

‚ÄúWe must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúNot just select people.‚Äù

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the ‚Äúfront parlor‚Äù, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information ‚Äúrelating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room‚Äù, said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúThese images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.‚Äù

Sydlowski‚Äôs work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, ‚Äúcreated specifically for those who were enslaved‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.‚Äù

It captures an ongoing battle. ‚ÄúNew York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,‚Äù said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúMy installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.‚Äù

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúHighlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,‚Äù said Prevost.

‚ÄúToday, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúFollowing our recent election, we‚Äôve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
889,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn‚Äôt know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry‚Äôs book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we‚Äôve diligently followed Barry‚Äôs class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute ‚Äúattendance card‚Äù, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I‚Äôve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn‚Äôt believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn‚Äôt bear to give away. It‚Äôs meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work ‚Äì writing, reporting, teaching ‚Äì I never worry if I‚Äôm doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we‚Äôve exhausted Lynda Barry‚Äôs attendance cards. Now we‚Äôve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity‚Äôs sake, and it‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that‚Äôs unpredictable ‚Äì will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? ‚Äì it feels good to let go of the ‚Äúperfect drawing‚Äù and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who‚Äôd burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I‚Äôd no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn‚Äôt quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I‚Äôm a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I‚Äôm floating in outer space, miles above Earth‚Äôs problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

890,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' ‚Äì the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. ‚ÄúIt seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn‚Äôt believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?‚Äù says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee‚Äôs Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called ‚Äúblack vernacular art‚Äù. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was ‚Äúgoing to change art history‚Äù. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with ‚Äúsongs of sorrow‚Äù from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion ‚Äì quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. ‚ÄúThat the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,‚Äù said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett‚Äôs son, Matt. ‚ÄúThe rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.‚Äù

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett ‚Äì like all the quilters ‚Äì was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt ‚Äì a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 ‚Äì now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters‚Äô work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee‚Äôs Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours ‚Äì typical of the period ‚Äì make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie‚Äôs daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a ‚Äúblock style‚Äù that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. ‚ÄúAs a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they‚Äôd let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,‚Äù she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, ‚Äúbut it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.‚Äù It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee‚Äôs Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw ‚Äì now director of Texas Southern University Museum ‚Äì captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created ‚Äúbetween picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband ‚Ä¶ [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.‚Äù

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts ‚Äì like Qunnie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHousetop‚Äù ‚Äì after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. ‚ÄúNormally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,‚Äù says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. ‚ÄúI do believe that the intentions were good, but I don‚Äôt think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,‚Äù she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It‚Äôs not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren‚Äôt many quilters among the younger generations, she says ‚Äì at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, ‚Äúbut our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
891,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano‚Äôs 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier‚Äôs pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,‚Äù Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado‚Äôs Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

‚ÄúThis is some of the worst work in the world,‚Äù said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park‚Äôs rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement ‚Äì and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers‚Äô lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill‚Äôs toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel‚Äôs Landing in Utah‚Äôs Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

‚ÄúIf I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out ‚Ä¶ and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,‚Äù Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill‚Äôs toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren‚Äôt cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they‚Äôre not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag ‚Äì often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell ‚Äì or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah‚Äôs Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won‚Äôt degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

‚ÄúPeople are really opening up to the idea,‚Äù Henry said.

Plastic bags aren‚Äôt a perfect fix ‚Äì they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don‚Äôt want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don‚Äôt have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

‚ÄúOnce you get eight miles into the backcountry, it‚Äôs up to you to dig a hole,‚Äù Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
892,Cabaret's Joel Grey: 'Life is tough. But it's also beautiful',[],"‚ÄúShame on you! How could you bring that up? You wanna see a grown man cry?‚Äù Joel Grey is berating me on Zoom. All I wanted to know was how he got the nickname Mr Porno when filming his role as the Emcee, the smirking ringleader he created on Broadway in Kander and Ebb‚Äôs Weimar musical Cabaret. Mercifully, he is teasing me.

It‚Äôs not for the first time in our chat. There is a glint in his eye when he impersonates a ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy, breaks into a snippet of Sixteen Going on Seventeen from The Sound of Music (he once auditioned to play Rolf) and punctuates answers with a high-pitched exhalation that sounds like air escaping from a balloon. When he asks if I want to go to the Oscars I half-believe he‚Äôll take me. His party piece turns out to be an impression of Diana Ross, who handed him his statuette for best supporting actor for Cabaret at the Academy Awards in 1973. ‚ÄúListen to this,‚Äù he says, coming closer to the screen. ‚ÄúAnd the Oscar goes to,‚Äù he half-whispers in a breathy, suspenseful sigh. ‚ÄúJoel ‚Ä¶ Grey!‚Äù

Grey is 88 going on 18. In a pale pink shirt and clear frame glasses, he pops up not with the Emcee‚Äôs willkommen or bienvenue but a perky ‚ÄúHiya! How are ya?‚Äù He is in the office of his New York loft apartment, overlooking Hudson River park. The Oscar can be glimpsed in profile on the windowsill, alongside a Tony award for Cabaret. I‚Äôve already taken a virtual tour of his loft ‚Äì where his own photographs hang among artworks by Robert Rauschenberg and Duane Michals ‚Äì as it was featured in an interior design video online. I compliment him on his airy bathroom where a giant photograph of Machu Picchu hangs next to a monolithic tub. ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre not going in there today,‚Äù he replies briskly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good place for an interview.‚Äù

He has spent the morning making french toast and compiling a personal scrapbook of old pictures. It may be the next in his series of photography books, which have included a volume of vibrant closeup portraits of flowers. One of his lockdown hobbies is buying blooms at a nearby shop, then spending hours ‚Äúpulling them apart and looking deep inside‚Äù. He disappears to fetch a large print of purple petals and holds it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a face,‚Äù he says from behind the photograph. ‚ÄúA scary, beautiful thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs true: the flower resembles a glowing skull, somehow both richly flamboyant and ethereal. The picture remains held up, filling the screen. There is a silence. Do I talk to the flower? ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Grey chuckles from behind it.

With Broadway‚Äôs theatres closed by the pandemic, what has Grey been doing for entertainment? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at TikTok,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that? Everybody is doing it. My grandchild is doing it. And I don‚Äôt know what it is!‚Äù Has he been going out much? ‚ÄúLess and less. I live across the street from the river and there‚Äôs a beautiful park. When we go there, it‚Äôs jammed with people ‚Äì with masks mostly, but I get nervous.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot to fit into Grey‚Äôs scrapbook. He has been acting for almost 80 years. His professional debut, aged nine, was in his home town of Cleveland in On Borrowed Time, a macabre comedy about death. The experience ‚Äúgrabbed my throat and held me to the fire‚Äù, he remembers. ‚ÄúI knew I was an actor.‚Äù It resonated so strongly that he staged a revival of On Borrowed Time a few years ago and, this year, directed a Zoom reading of it. He has returned to Cabaret, too, reprising the Emcee on stage in the 80s. It will always be his most famous role, but there have been many others on Broadway: as the showman George M Cohan (in George M!, the closure of which was blamed on Richard Nixon visiting backstage); the Wizard of Oz in the hit Wicked; luckless ‚ÄúMr Cellophane‚Äù Amos Hart in Chicago, also from Kander and Ebb; and most recently, wistful servant Firs in The Cherry Orchard in 2016.

A year earlier, Grey made headlines when he came out in People magazine at the age of 82. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like labels,‚Äù he told his interviewer, ‚Äúbut if you have to put a label on it, I‚Äôm a gay man.‚Äù It had taken time, he said, to ‚Äúembrace that other part of who I always was‚Äù. In his 2016 memoir, Master of Ceremonies, he wrote about how, since his youth, he had felt forced to hide his sexuality. Grey detailed early relationships, including with a bellboy at the residential hotel where his family lived in an apartment, and described a permanent hyper-alertness about being ‚Äúsmall, sissy, Jewish‚Äù. It is frequently a painful read: his mother is disgusted when he comes out to her as a teenager by telling her about a threesome he had with a cantor from their temple. When he tells his wife, Jo Wilder, about his past gay experiences it deepens a void between them that ends their 24-year marriage in the early 80s. Their children are the actor Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing) and James, a chef. Grey describes how important it was for them both to see him play a gay man on stage, in Larry Kramer‚Äôs landmark Aids drama The Normal Heart, to better understand their father.

One of Grey‚Äôs first film roles (as a smirking law student in Come September in 1961) was opposite Rock Hudson, who was leading his own double life as a gay man in Hollywood. Grey remembers him as ‚Äúa really nice, funny guy‚Äù. When Hudson died of complications from Aids in 1985, it increased awareness of an epidemic that for many was ‚Äútoo horrible to accept or think through‚Äù, Grey says. Denial and misinformation were rife. One scene in The Normal Heart required him to kiss another man. ‚ÄúA friend of mine said, you ought to find out from a doctor whether or not you are putting yourself at risk,‚Äù remembers Grey. ‚ÄúI called this doctor who was taking care of Rock Hudson. He said: ‚ÄòDo you have to kiss the actor?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòYeah, it‚Äôs important in the script.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòThen I wouldn‚Äôt do the play.‚Äô‚Äù Grey wrestled with it and chose the play and the kiss. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI need to tell this story. As an actor it‚Äôs my job.‚Äô And it‚Äôs what I live for.‚Äù He remembers Kramer, who died this year, as a ‚Äútough audience‚Äù, but ‚Äúvery supportive of my work‚Äù.

It is theatre, rather than film or TV, that has been Grey‚Äôs passion since his childhood debut. Back then he was Joel Katz. His grandparents were eastern European Jews who settled in Cleveland. Joel was the first of two sons born to Mickey, a musician and comedian who found fame with his Jewish revue the Borscht Capades, and Grace, who named him after her favourite actor, Joel McCrea, and hungered for him to become famous.

A pair of contrasting scenes in Grey‚Äôs memoir find him alone as a boy. In one, his mother takes him to New York for an audition that never materialises, and leaves him scared in their hotel room when she goes out with a man. In the other, he is accidentally abandoned in the theatre after hours but is unafraid and revels in its backstage magic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want anybody to come and get me,‚Äù he tells me.

At nine, Grey craved a serious theatre career. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I cared about.‚Äù But after appearing in his dad‚Äôs revue, he became a nightclub performer and was spotted by the entertainer Eddie Cantor who gave him a spot on his TV show in 1951 when Grey was 18. His whirlwind routine is on YouTube: wide-eyed and elfin-featured, Grey cracks jokes, barks like a seal, does the charleston and dances like a dream. It‚Äôs a five-minute delight but the result, he says, was that ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get any parts in plays. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòOh no, he‚Äôs a TV guy‚Äô or ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a nightclub guy.‚Äô It kind of got in the way of my legitimacy.‚Äù His nightclub years included playing the London Palladium on a bill with Johnnie Ray, whose more fervent admirers threw Ray their underwear. ‚ÄúSometimes they forgot to clear the stage,‚Äù recalls Grey, who then had to dance a path between the knickers.

He was considering giving up acting when Cabaret came along. Where would he have gone? ‚ÄúAn art gallery,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúOr a hotdog stand.‚Äù The impish Emcee was the first theatre role he was offered without an audition. The songs may have been great but when he first read the script, he was alarmed that he had no dialogue and no direct involvement with the plot. The role was essentially a metaphor for seduction and corruption. ‚ÄúI was worried that it was one-dimensional, that he was a nightclub performer doing numbers.‚Äù That was precisely what Grey had been trying to escape. ‚ÄúI had to find out the psychology [of the Emcee] and who he was off stage so that hopefully I could bring that biography into those numbers.‚Äù

Six-year-old Jennifer would accompany him to the theatre, watching from the wings and even getting made up as one of the Kit Kat Girls in the seedy club. Elements of the Emcee‚Äôs look, notably the neatly combed hair and the bow tie, mirrored how Grey‚Äôs mother had dressed him as a child. Some of the makeup he used was his wife‚Äôs. His co-star Lotte Lenya ‚Äì celebrated chanteuse, ex-wife of Kurt Weill, and James Bond‚Äôs nemesis Rosa Klebb ‚Äì helped him with the German accent. Jill Haworth was Sally Bowles, the club dancer who longs for a gig at a respectable film studio ‚Äì surely a feeling Grey could relate to.

What made Cabaret so groundbreaking? ‚ÄúFirst of all, it was about a heinous and terrifying subject: the Holocaust. There were a lot of people who just wanted to forget about it. They tried to write it out of textbooks.‚Äù The musical‚Äôs unflinching account of antisemitism and persecution remains horribly current, much like Fiddler on the Roof, which Grey recently directed in a Yiddish version at New York‚Äôs Museum of Jewish Heritage. In the years immediately after the second world war, Mickey Katz had had hits with Yiddish parodies of popular songs (Haim Afen Range, for example, after Home on the Range). His father was, Grey wrote proudly in his memoir, ‚Äúinserting Jews into pop culture, so that we belonged, too‚Äù.

Grey says he and the producer-director, Hal Prince, were in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù creating Cabaret together on Broadway. But when Bob Fosse came to direct the film version he did not want to inherit Grey‚Äôs Emcee. ‚ÄúThere was a total standoff.‚Äù It was Fosse who called him Mr Porno, but Grey insists: ‚ÄúHe was the original Mr Porno! He was in burlesque backstage when he was a teenager. He saw all that bizarreness as a kid and was attracted to it.‚Äù Grey came to believe that Fosse‚Äôs animosity towards him was because he wanted to play the Emcee himself. ‚ÄúHe was an excellent performer,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúHe could have done it.‚Äù

At the Oscars, Grey beat three actors from The Godfather ‚Äì James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino ‚Äì and The Heartbreak Kid‚Äôs Eddie Albert. I imagine the Godfather mob glowering at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve forgiven me!‚Äù he laughs.

Cabaret matched its Tony awards tally of eight wins ‚Äì including best director for Fosse and best actress for Liza Minnelli. When Grey‚Äôs name was read out at the Oscars ceremony, there was Minnelli behind him, dressed in canary yellow, rocking wildly with delight. She was a great choice to play Bowles, he thinks, and her own irresistible sense of fun came with a vulnerability, too. Minnelli would fall asleep on his shoulder on the early morning taxi drives from the hotel to the set. The pair went on to launch a nightclub act in Vegas that they toured around the US. One night, she introduced him on stage before he was ready but he strolled on trouser-less regardless. They performed separately and together, with a set list including Cabaret songs.

Decades later, people are still quoting the Emcee to him. Is it an albatross in any way? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù He advances to the screen. ‚ÄúLet me come closer to you: just ‚Ä¶ great!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only boundary-breaking musical he has worked on. Grey has a small but joyous scene in Lars von Trier‚Äôs Dancer in the Dark, tap-dancing in a courtroom with Bj√∂rk. That looked like fun, I suggest. ‚ÄúWrong,‚Äù he barks back. ‚ÄúHard! The two of them [Bj√∂rk and Von Trier] were not connecting. [We] were in the midst of doing something very unique, and the star and the director weren‚Äôt talking.‚Äù

We‚Äôve rambled way beyond our allotted time and Grey has his scrapbook and his art to attend to. But he starts another story about visiting Cleveland‚Äôs art museum as a kid, finding rooms to hide in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be in the Egyptian place getting into one of those sarcophaguses. I had this idea that I could hide in one of them.‚Äù His high-pitch exhale comes back, this time turning into a full ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù I wonder what he would say to nine-year-old Joel Katz, messing around in museums and embarking on his first stage role back in Cleveland. He replies: ‚ÄúStick with it, be who you are. It‚Äôs going to be tough.‚Äù There‚Äôs a beat. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also going to be beautiful.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

904,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire ‚Äì photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria‚Äôs 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: ‚ÄúWalking through the remains of Europe‚Äôs biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.‚Äù

A Valentine‚Äôs Day mug. Valentine‚Äôs Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

‚ÄúBetween the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone‚Äôs home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.‚Äù

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

‚ÄúThe owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.‚Äù

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

‚ÄúThis is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.‚Äù

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child‚Äôs shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

909,Tier 2 lockdown rules in England: the latest Covid restrictions explained,[],"The new system came into force in England on 2 December, replacing the national lockdown

England‚Äôs new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The ‚Äúrule of six‚Äù will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm ‚Äì with last orders at 10pm ‚Äì only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas ‚Äì from 23 December to 27 December ‚Äì there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

910,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London‚Äôs Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: ‚ÄúWithout the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

‚ÄúPolice took a measured response. You, however, didn‚Äôt engage with police ‚Äì police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.‚Äù

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge ‚Äì meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment ‚Äì after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park‚Äôs Speakers‚Äô Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by ‚Äúaddressing the gathering and encouraging ‚Ä¶ others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,‚Äù the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a ‚Äúlight-touch policing‚Äù approach by encouraging the gatherings to ‚Äúdisperse without the necessity for enforcement action‚Äù.

But Corbyn, he added, had ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù participated in the gathering ‚Äúby way of making public addresses‚Äù and that he allegedly ‚Äúdisregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period‚Äù.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 ‚Äúis not a pandemic‚Äù and argue that ‚Äúif it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us‚Äù.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: ‚ÄúThis case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers‚Äô Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

‚ÄúMr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.‚Äù

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A ‚Äúblanket ban‚Äù on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a tremendous result.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
911,'It's lovely to be back': on the streets of three-tier England as lockdown lifts,[],"England‚Äôs second national lockdown lifted on Wednesday, with 99% of the population placed under the second and third tiers of a three-tier regime. However, non-essential shops are allowed to open under every tier, giving shop owners hope for a much-needed high street boost ahead of Christmas. The Guardian went out on Wednesday to take the mood across the different zones.

Tier 1: St Ives

The Three Ferrets pub in the Cornish harbour-side town of St Ives was buzzing with chatter and laughter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lovely to be back,‚Äù said Richard Cockling, 83, a retired merchant seaman and fisherman as he sipped on a celebratory gin and tonic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed this place. The latest lockdown has been the worst ‚Äì long and boring. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back into this place.‚Äù

Keith Tickner, 59, a cleaner, settled down in his usual cosy spot in front of the blazing fire with a group of friends. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how much you miss your mates and your routine until you‚Äôre allowed back,‚Äù he said.

St Ives, a long-beloved retreat for artists, beach lovers and surfers, was recently judged the happiest place to live in the UK. On the day it and the rest of Cornwall became the only area in mainland England to begin life in tier 1 it felt a jolly town to be in.

From first light, the town was packed with delivery lorries restocking the shops, cafes and restaurants. Bleary-eyed kitchen staff emerged from furlough to begin prepping for dinner time while shopkeepers polished windows and scrubbed floors.

‚ÄúLook at that cobweb,‚Äù said Paul Clegg, a potter who specialises in lucky Cornish piskies, his take on the leprechaun, as he buffed his windows. ‚ÄúThis is the best place in the country anyway. So many people who live here came on holiday, then just decided to stay because it‚Äôs so nice. But it does feel a particularly good day today.‚Äù

Opposite, Sarah Allen was putting up Christmas lights outside her cafe, Sky‚Äôs Diner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù She expected to be busy. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get visitors coming from all over the country who want a taste of life in tier 1,‚Äù she said.

Cornwall council‚Äôs leader, Julian German, called it a ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù for the county but asked people not to drop their guard. ‚ÄúCovid doesn‚Äôt care what tier we‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòWe live in a bit of a bubble here‚Äô: Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor shop. Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian

The advantages of living in tier 1 include being allowed to have a drink in a pub without a meal and to meet in a group of up to six indoors as well as outside.

People from tier 3 areas have been urged by the council not to visit Cornwall and the police this week revealed that up to 10 extra cars would be patrolling Devon and Cornwall to deal with Covid rule-breakers.

The council said people from tier 2 areas should bring the restrictions they are subject to at home with them ‚Äúlike hand luggage‚Äù. For example, those in tier 2, should have a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù with their pub drink.

Of course, enforcing such rules are difficult. The Pilchard Press, a real ale pub tucked up an alley near the harbour, was taking no chances. It had fixed a notice to its railings reading: ‚ÄúCornwall residents only‚Äù.

At the Golden Lion pub, licensee Matt Squires said he would be politely asking people where they are from if he did not recognise them. ‚ÄúWe plan to keep people from different tiers separate,‚Äù he said. Locals will be able to use the front bar looking on to the street, visitors the back bar.

Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor clothes shop, said that tier 1 living would not change much for many people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the shops but actually we live in a bit of a bubble here, close to nature and the water. It‚Äôs why people like it.‚Äù SM

Tier 2: Liverpool

‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt seem as scared to come out‚Äô: Rob Pritchard, manager at vintage clothes shop Resurrection in Liverpool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

Vans lined up outside the independent shops and restaurants on Liverpool‚Äôs Bold Street in the morning drizzle to deliver stock to eager staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling festive, we‚Äôve got our Christmas music on and our twinkly lights on,‚Äù said Nicki Whatling, a manager at Rennie‚Äôs Arts and Crafts, as picture frames were unloaded into the store.

While the shop has only 23 days to make up the bulk of lost sales over lockdown, she said she was hopeful the business could ‚Äúhave a fairly decent December‚Äù.

As the day wore on, Whatling‚Äôs wishes began to look more likely, with throngs of Christmas shoppers trickling up and down the city‚Äôs streets. At the vintage clothes store Resurrection, where students were sifting through leisurewear and parents were picking out gifts, the director Rob Pritchard said there had ‚Äúbeen a buzz about the place‚Äù in the middle of the day.

Usually, he said, the store would be much quieter in early December after the Black Friday sales weekend, but he predicted the store would continue to be busy throughout this month. ‚ÄúA lot of people are saying they‚Äôre taking the chance to get back into the city again. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that today,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhen we ended the last lockdown some people were still too scared to come out. This time maybe because the infection rates have fallen so much in Liverpool, they don‚Äôt seem as scared to come.‚Äù

Meanwhile, at the pizza restaurant Crust, the manager Antonio Fornaro was grateful the venue had been able to open ahead of Christmas. ‚ÄúWhen they announced it, I had calls from all my colleagues saying, ‚ÄòYes! We‚Äôre going to be able to open‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Throughout England‚Äôs second national lockdown, takeaway sales had dropped off as people reigned in spending, said Fornaro. But on Wednesday afternoon, the reduced tables and chairs in the restaurant were full once again.

Outside the trainer store Size?, university student Adam Macholc, 18, was one of a small socially distanced group of sneakerheads waiting for the latest Adidas drop as staff inside got ready to open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying them for myself,‚Äù he said, adding that despite a turbulent first term, ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a bit more hope‚Äù after the news that the UK had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

In Liverpool‚Äôs main commercial shopping district, around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, other shoppers seemed to be feeling confident too. A queue snaked around the city‚Äôs Primark store, while shoppers trickled in and out of Debenhams to pick up a bargain.

Willing some of them to stop for a substantial meal and a drink on their way home, was the manager of the Doctor Duncan‚Äôs pub, Amy McCarthy. Under tier 2 regulations, a key difference with tier 1 is alcohol cannot be served without food and there must be no multiple household mixing in venues like Doctor Duncan‚Äôs. The pub, located away from the main shopping centre next to Liverpool Lime Street station, had a quiet day with only a handful of customers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next to the bus stops where people usually head to football games and are known for being the first and the last stop. So it‚Äôs different territory for us having to emphasise our pub grub,‚Äù she said. AW

Tier 3: Nottingham

After a month cooped up indoors, shoppers in Nottingham seized the opportunity to return to the city centre on Wednesday.

The east Midlands city is back in tier 3, and is therefore subject to England‚Äôs toughest coronavirus restrictions. Shops, hair salons and gyms have been allowed to reopen, but hospitality venues must offer takeaway or delivery only.

In the city centre, stallholders were preparing for this weekend‚Äôs opening of the Christmas market on Old Market Square, in the heart of the city.

The prime location is overlooked by an imposing six-storey stone building which houses the department store Debenhams, and on the other side of the square is a Dorothy Perkins and a Burton ‚Äì brands that are part of Philip Green‚Äôs Arcadia empire. Both Debenhams and Arcadia are living on borrowed time, having collapsed into administration on consecutive days this week

If Arcadia‚Äôs brands do not find a buyer, Nottingham will feel the impact of store closures keenly. The city is home to nine Arcadia stores ‚Äì .

Tallulah Harries-Pugh, 29, was holding a Topshop carrier bag, but with an item to return rather than a new purchase.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with Sir Philip Green‚Äôs ethics, and I try not to shop [at Arcadia brands],‚Äù said Tallulah. But she said she was worried about the staff, and what more store closures would mean for the high street.

The scars of another recent retail collapse are clearly visible in Nottingham city centre. One of the city‚Äôs two shopping centres, Broadmarsh, was half-demolished with plans under way for a multimillion pound redevelopment, when its owner, the retail property company Intu, collapsed in June.

The city council has been handed the keys to the development and has already spent ¬£19m on the project. Councillor Sam Webster, whose ward covers the city centre, concedes it won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. The project is probably the biggest regeneration in a core city in the country‚Äù.

In the short-term, however, Nottingham‚Äôs businesses have to contend with tier 3 restrictions.

Prof David Paton from Nottingham University business school warns that retailers will feel the impact of cafe, pub and restaurant closures. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of interlinkage between high street hospitality and shops. Nottingham is going to face that, as all tier 3 will.‚Äù

In a normal year the nine stainless steel fermenting vessels at the Castle Rock brewery near the city‚Äôs train station would be full, ahead of the expected peak in demand during the festive season. This December they are empty.

‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas‚Äô: Colin Wilde, MD of Castle Rock brewery in Nottingham. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas,‚Äù said the managing director, Colin Wilde. The brewer and pub operator has 22 sites in Nottingham and across the east Midlands, all in tier 3.

The company now offers takeaway alcohol from its brewery and pubs, but it brings in less than 10% of normal trade, and Wilde said the closed pubs ‚Äúleak cash‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a sector, we feel like canaries in a cage. It feels like politicians are testing things out on the hospitality sector and don‚Äôt think it matters if it dies.‚Äù JP",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
912,No 10 and regulator contradict Hancock's 'because of Brexit' Covid vaccine claim,[],"Both Downing Street and the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator have contradicted a claim by Matt Hancock that Brexit helped the UK become the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus.

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK‚Äôs decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. ‚ÄúWe have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,‚Äù said June Raine, the MHRA‚Äôs chief executive.

Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day ‚Äì decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs‚Äô approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock‚Äôs stated view, Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

‚ÄúI think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,‚Äù he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it‚Äôs obviously incredibly positive news.‚Äù

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat job of working with the company to look at that data as it‚Äôs come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would‚Äù.

Hancock continued: ‚ÄúThe second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

‚ÄúWe do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they‚Äôre done because of Brexit.‚Äù

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing ‚Äúfast and loose with the facts‚Äù over the vaccine. The party‚Äôs health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim ‚Äúis not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look‚Äù.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock‚Äôs department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA‚Äôs ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as ‚Äúpart of wider conversations‚Äù about the MHRA‚Äôs lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA‚Äôs role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

After breakfast, join your tour manager and board the coach for the journey through Snowdonia National Park to the Welsh island of Anglesey. Stop at Plas Newydd, home of the Marquess of Anglesey.

Beaumaris‚Äô UNESCO-listed castle dates back to the 13th century, when Edward I ordered its construction as part of his campaign to conquer Wales. However, construction of the castle was abandoned in the early 14th century when resources were diverted toward the invasion of Scotland. The unfinished castle was then occupied by the Welsh, and taken back by the English, and then reoccupied by forces loyal to Charles I during the English Civil War. Today, the castle remains as it was then: an unfinished masterpiece of near complete symmetry. The tour manager will bring the castle‚Äôs fascinating history to life, regaling you with tales stretching back the best part of a thousand years. Enjoy some free time for lunch in the town (payable locally) before continuing across the Menai Suspension Bridge to Caernarfon, on the Welsh mainland.

Your tour manager will give a talk outside the castle, and there will be time for those who wish to enter to do so (entrance payable locally).

You‚Äôll start at 4 am this morning (early by anyone‚Äôs standards), clambering over rocky paths as vegetation thins out with the ever-increasing altitude. There are long sections of scree, and the climb becomes challenging because of the loose rock. Once you pass the 4,000m point, there are magnificent panoramic views across the valleys and lower summits of the High Atlas Range. The feeling of achievement you‚Äôll get at the top is monumental.

927,Mt Toubkal Long Weekend - Winter,[],"Mt Toubkal, you tricky customer

With our 50th birthdays looming, a few friends decided to take on a challenge. Onto the Exodus website we went... All 4 of us are fairly fit so decided a ""challenging"" level would be just the ticket! Mt Toubkal did not disappoint! It was definitely a challenge! Who knew it could rain and snow so much in August? Because we followed the trip notes, universal packing and read some reviews, we believed we were ready! We just didn't account for the altitude sickness! This took 3 of us out and only one of us made it to the summit.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip? For me, it was the summit and just before! The hours before the summit were extremely difficult as you are hiking in the dark with just a head torch, following the boots of the person in front. It was steep, raining/hailing so it was slow going. When we stopped just shy of the summit, we witnessed the most amazing sight: A rainbow over the High Atlas Mountains! It was worth all the rain to see this sight. After waking up at 330am, hiking for 4+ hours, the summit was a sight to behold! (even if it was snowing in August... in Morocco... yes, snow in August!)

What did you think of your group leader? Ilyas our group leader and Abdul his assistant were amazing!!! With 3 of my friends ill with altitude sickness, Abdul took incredible care of them. Both Ilyas and Abdul have a great sense of humour and made us all laugh. After 2 days we understood ""Ilyas time"" (ie 5 min in our time is 10 in Ilyas time) and his love of telling time in seconds! Ilyas organised our day well and I now miss someone telling me when to wake up, when to eat and when to start walking! They both gave us a great insight into Moroccan culture and the religion of Islam. I have left knowing I will have a ""home away from home"" in Morocco! Ilyas also organised tours and spa visits on our last day in Marrakesh. He was great!!

Do you have any advice for potential travellers? Be prepared! Be fit! It is definitely NOT a walk in the park. Pack for all weathers including a rain cover for your day pack or at least a dry bag for inside the pack. Also I found sticks a must for descending. And have a head torch, not just a hand held torch because you need your hands to clamber over large rocks ets (also bring extra batteries just in case). Because you start and finish the summit ascent at the refuge, make sure you have clean dry WARM clothes ready for your return to the refuge. Drinks are not served with dinner at the refuge so make sure you have money to buy a drink from the shop or have a bottle of water ready. Also make sure you have dirham change for the hike as you stop at various places to buy juices on the way to the refuge. They won't take big denominations of dirham. Also, its best to have EUROs or Dirhams. Not many places were happy with ¬£ or USD.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its communist past now firmly confined to the history books, the city has rediscovered its imperial heritage in its beautifully restored baroque old town whilst the grand white fortress, former seat of the rulers, enjoys commanding views over the river. This morning we will discover more about the city‚Äôs interesting history, seeing the main sights and visiting some of the churches to view their traditional Christmas cribs, before you enjoy some free time. Wander the maze of streets, admiring the Christmas decorations until you reach the main square and the market with its cosy atmosphere; the sweet fragrance of cinnamon wafts on the air and hundreds of fairy lights twinkle amongst the branches of the Christmas trees. The pretty red and white stalls groan with inspirational artisan gifts, from decorations, wooden figurines or pottery. Sample some local delicacies too such as potato pancakes or poppy seed strudel but make sure you don‚Äôt spoil your appetite as it won‚Äôt be long until lunch is served back on board. Afterwards you may wish to return to shore ‚Äì perhaps to climb the tower of the Old Town Hall for a bird‚Äôs eye view of the city and the bustling market below. Alternatively, you may choose to join our optional excursion to Slovensky Grob, a village situated in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, famed for its geese rearing. We will visit a typical Slovak chalet to enjoy a wine tasting of some of the season‚Äôs new wines, accompanied by some typical local delicacies. Later we return to the ship where another excellent dinner will be served.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its communist past now firmly confined to the history books, the city has rediscovered its imperial heritage in its beautifully restored baroque old town whilst the grand white fortress, former seat of the rulers, enjoys commanding views over the river. This morning we will discover more about the city‚Äôs interesting history, seeing the main sights and visiting some of the churches to view their traditional Christmas cribs, before you enjoy some free time. Wander the maze of streets, admiring the Christmas decorations until you reach the main square and the market with its cosy atmosphere; the sweet fragrance of cinnamon wafts on the air and hundreds of fairy lights twinkle amongst the branches of the Christmas trees. The pretty red and white stalls groan with inspirational artisan gifts, from decorations, wooden figurines or pottery. Sample some local delicacies too such as potato pancakes or poppy seed strudel but make sure you don‚Äôt spoil your appetite as it won‚Äôt be long until lunch is served back on board. Afterwards you may wish to return to shore ‚Äì perhaps to climb the tower of the Old Town Hall for a bird‚Äôs eye view of the city and the bustling market below. Alternatively, you may choose to join our optional excursion to Slovensky Grob, a village situated in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, famed for its geese rearing. We will visit a typical Slovak chalet to enjoy a wine tasting of some of the season‚Äôs new wines, accompanied by some typical local delicacies. Later we return to the ship where another excellent dinner will be served.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many, today‚Äôs visit to Vienna will be one of the highlights of the cruise. The city‚Äôs very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city‚Äôs most iconic monument is the breathtaking Saint Stephen‚Äôs Cathedral, whose striking multi-coloured roof and huge Gothic South Tower dominate the skyline. There‚Äôs also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School, and where the Vienna Boys‚Äô Choir performs. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire, including, allegedly, the sabre of Charlemagne himself. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, which contains the world‚Äôs fourth largest collection of paintings, is just across the road. This morning we have a tour with a local guide offering insights into why Vienna is one of Europe‚Äôs great capitals ‚Äì the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world‚Äôs finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and, of course, a whole family of Strausses. During the afternoon you‚Äôre free to explore as you wish. Take a stroll in the Prater, notable for the huge Ferris wheel that features in several Cold War spy thrillers. Or, for something quite different, visit the Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, a former royal residence now housing a range of world-class museums and galleries. Perhaps, though, just take a stroll through Vienna‚Äôs atmospheric side streets, or enjoy a coffee and a slice of delicious Sachertorte in one of the lovely coffee houses. This evening we‚Äôve arranged truly the ‚Äòicing on the cake‚Äô: no visit to Vienna is complete without a live musical experience, so after dinner we have a classical recital on board. To hear this exquisite music played in the city of its creation makes a wonderful finale to the day.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

934,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from Ant√≥nio Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: ‚ÄúHumanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back ‚Äì and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes ‚Ä¶ Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.‚Äù

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) ‚Äì which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible ‚Äì and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump‚Äôs vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

‚ÄúMaking peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,‚Äù he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. ‚ÄúIt must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.‚Äù

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. ‚ÄúThis is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test ‚Ä¶ We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.‚Äù

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable ‚Äì even in rich countries ‚Äì were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Ni√±a weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: ‚ÄúI firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year ‚Äì the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.‚Äù

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to ‚Äúflick the green switch‚Äù while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days‚Äô time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: ‚ÄúWe need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.‚Äù

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. ‚ÄúNext year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,‚Äù he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. ‚ÄúThere is no vaccine against climate warming,‚Äù he warned. ‚ÄúBut there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.‚Äù

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

‚ÄúMoney, money, money,‚Äù said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. ‚ÄúThe question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.‚Äù

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK‚Äôs spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host‚Äôs leverage in bringing developing countries together.

‚ÄúA country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
935,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"An alleged ‚Äúbribery for pardon‚Äù scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered ‚Äúa substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence‚Äù.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the ‚Äúbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äù, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the ‚Äúsubject or target‚Äù of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. ‚ÄúPardon investigation is Fake News!‚Äù he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‚Äòbribery-for-pardon schemes‚Äô is.‚Äù

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Juli√°n Castro tweeted: ‚ÄúIn 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day ‚Äì but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton‚Äôs use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a ‚Äúpre-emptive pardon‚Äù. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives‚Äô intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt presume ‚Äì and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

‚ÄúIt may be someone that we‚Äôve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn‚Äôt have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.‚Äù

937,'I saw people dying on the road': Tigray's traumatised war refugees,[],"When Ethiopia‚Äôs army shelled Humera, a small agricultural city in Tigray, in mid-November, 54-year-old Gush Tela rushed his wife and three children to safety in a nearby town.

A few days later, he felt compelled to find out what had become of his home. As he approached the city on his motorbike, riding through the arid countryside, he said the stench of countless dead bodies filled the air.

Men, women and children lay strewn along the road and in the surrounding fields, their bodies riddled with bullet holes, Tela said.

‚ÄúI saw many dead people being eaten by dogs,‚Äù Tela said from a refugee camp just over the border in Sudan, his voice breaking. ‚ÄúI saw many people dying on the road. Many difficult things, difficult to express, difficult to imagine.‚Äù

Tigray was plunged into conflict on 4 November, when Ethiopia‚Äôs prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, ordered a military campaign against the region‚Äôs ruling party, the Tigray People‚Äôs Liberation Front. Abiy accused the TPLF attacking federal military camps in Tigray and seeking to destabilise the country, which the TPLF denies.

Accounts have emerged of appalling violence committed by multiple actors on both sides of the conflict, but with communications down and the media barred, it has been impossible to independently verify incidents ‚Äì and who was responsible.

On Wednesday, the United Nations said it and Ethiopia‚Äôs government had signed a deal to allow ‚Äúunimpeded‚Äù humanitarian access to Tigray ‚Äì at least the parts now under federal government control. The aid may come too late for some. For weeks, the UN and others have pleaded for access amid reports of food, medicines and other supplies running out for millions of people.

Before the conflict, the worsening political tensions between Addis Ababa and the TPLF seemed remote to Tela. ‚ÄúI was searching only for work. I was not much interested in the political process. I knew nothing about what was happening,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI never felt this situation would ever happen.‚Äù



Faint outlines of Tigrayan buildings and telephone towers break through the milky sky in Hamdayet, the small, impoverished Sudanese border town where Tela and 3,000 other refugees are encamped. They are among more 45,000 who have fled the violence, travelling for days through woods and over the Sittet River to the safety of Sudan. A second camp has sprung up in Um Raquba.

Many of the refugees nurse multiple diseases, often picked up on the days-long, gruelling journey. Clinics at the two camps are struggling to provide necessary care. Those who have made it tell of desperate people who were left behind, blocked by federal Ethiopian forces.

At the weekend, federal troops took over the Tigrayan capital, Mekelle, and officials in Addis Ababa said that military operations were complete. The TPLF, which had dominated Ethiopia‚Äôs governing coalition for decades before Abiy came to power in 2018, appears to have retreated, signalling the end of battlefield clashes for now, though experts warn federal forces could face a lengthy insurgency.

About 600,000 people in Tigray were already dependent on food aid even before the conflict, including more than 100,000 refugees from Eritrea. The UN had warned of the risk of people starving in the coming days unless access was permitted.

Isolated Sudanese towns in one of the poorest regions on Earth have opened their homes to their neighbours, yet the pressures are acute. A transitional government in place since the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year is struggling to contend with discontent over a worsening economy and shortages off essential supplies.

Before the influx of refugees, the region was already in major need of support and development, according to Imad Aoun from M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost two crisis on top of each other,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe are trying to mitigate some of this, on the one hand providing support to those who are coming, and supporting the local system.‚Äù

Reports of atrocities have fuelled the conflict, which may stoke ethnic and other tensions across Africa‚Äôs second most populous country. In one of the worst incidents, Amnesty International reported that scores, possibly hundreds, of civilians were massacred with knives and machetes in a town south of Humera in early November. Witnesses told Amnesty that forces loyal to the TPLF were to blame, though Amnesty said it had not been able to independently confirm responsibility.



Tela moves gingerly, and has bandages wrapped around his calves and wrists. He said federal soldiers had found him in Humera and beaten him until he was covered in blood and could not walk, then passed him over to a brutal militia force of ethnic Amharans called the Fano. He said the Fano had been tasked with destroying the city and ‚Äúfinishing‚Äù Tigrayans.

The Fano had taken over a judicial court in Humera. Barely mobile and gushing blood, Tela said he was allowed to heave himself away. Gesturing a knife to his neck, he said he saw a man in his 30s beheaded with machetes.



Refugees in the camp reel off accounts of horror they either witnessed themselves or heard from others. In a makeshift ward in a room near the back of the camp, some show wounds they say were caused by knife and machete attacks by Fano militia.

For the last month, Tefera Tedros, a 42-year-old surgeon, has seen the results of the violence up close. Before war broke out he divided his time between a government hospital and a private clinic. ‚ÄúIt was very successful,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI was maintaining [a good life], sending my kids to school, and all the basic necessities. Now everything is gone.‚Äù

Tedros said his hospital in Humera received 15 dead civilians on the first day of shelling on 8 November. ‚ÄúBut those who were not brought to the hospital, who died on the streets or at home, were uncountable,‚Äù he said.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Men shaving near the Um Raquba camp. Photograph: Ed Ram

With colleagues, he desperately loaded critical patients into tractors borrowed from people nearby, and drove them to the bigger town of Adwa, as ammunition ricocheted around the city. Then he fled into the woods and eventually made it to Hamdayet.

He is the only doctor at one of two clinics at the camp, working around the clock. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been 10 days working, 24 hours [a day]. This clinic was meant to service not more than 50 patients a day, at the maximum. Now we‚Äôre serving 200 patients,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre running out of drugs every time, so we‚Äôre using secondary options, tertiary options. Not the drugs that we need but the drugs that we have.‚Äù

Tedros said the journey to Hamdayet had taken a severe toll on many in the camp. ‚ÄúRespiratory illnesses are very common now because people have walked long distances that were full of dust and were sleeping on the ground with no sheet, mattress, nothing. Most of them have infections of the lung.‚Äù

Abdominal and skin diseases are common among refugees too. ‚ÄúWe were drinking from ponds, just on the side of cattle,‚Äù he said.

Aid agencies have stepped in to provide vital drugs and care, yet this was not enough, he said. The are people suffering with diabetes, HIV and cancer in the camp who aren‚Äôt accessing treatment.

Women‚Äôs reproductive health needs are also dangerously unmet. Twenty pregnant women were due to give birth soon in Hamdayet, Tedros said. At the Um Raqaba camp, a 26-year-old refugee told UNFPA officials late last month that she began menstruating on the day she arrived, and had sold her phone to buy underwear cotton and soap.

Despite the horrors they recount, many of the refugees are anxious to return, hoping they will not have to leave for good. They are sensitive to any resentment or criticism of Tigray‚Äôs leadership.

Ngisti Yohans, 27, fled with her son after hearing reports of Tigrayans being raped by militias. She accused Abiy of exploiting ethnic divisions and fuelling resentment. ‚ÄúIt is purely ethnic,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe country was fair but Abiy wanted all the power. The government made it seem that the problems with Ethiopia were because of Tigray.‚Äù

The rest of her family remains in Tigray. ‚ÄúMy life is there, my family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just waiting to see if things improve.‚Äù

938,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc‚Äôs chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as ‚Äúderisory‚Äù by Downing Street.

On the ‚Äúlevel playing field‚Äù provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

‚ÄúBarnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs the rush?‚Äô‚Äù said one senior EU diplomat. ‚ÄúAmbassadors for every country bordering the UK ‚Äì 11 all in all ‚Äì raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.‚Äù

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. ‚ÄúThe EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,‚Äù a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

Timeline From Brefusal to Brexit: a history of Britain in the EU Show Hide After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK‚Äôs sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain‚Äôs entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a ‚Äúdeep-seated hostility‚Äù towards the European project. Brentry With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.

Referendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand ‚Äúour own money back‚Äù claiming for every ¬£2 contributed we get only ¬£1 back‚Äù despite being one of the ‚Äúthree poorer‚Äù members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in ‚Äúembryo‚Äù. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

An EU diplomat said: ‚ÄúWe are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

‚ÄúAs we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.‚Äù

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe‚Äôs coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

A source said: ‚ÄúFish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.‚Äù

David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament‚Äôs Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year.

He tweeted: ‚ÄúWe are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

‚ÄúSwift progress is of the essence. An agreement needs to be reached within very few days if council and parliament are to complete their respective procedures before the end of the transition period. Democratic scrutiny is not negotiable.‚Äù

939,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain‚Äôs hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,‚Äù he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: ‚ÄúI want to make sure we‚Äôre going to fight like hell by investing in America first.‚Äù He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America‚Äôs domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden‚Äôs priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his ‚Äúgoal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China‚Äôs abusive practices ‚Äì that‚Äôs stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations‚Äù and forcing ‚Äútech transfers‚Äù from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. ‚ÄúThe best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our ‚Äì or at least what used to be our ‚Äì allies on the same page. It‚Äôs going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.‚Äù

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: ‚ÄúLook, there‚Äôs a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.‚Äù He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal ‚Äúwith the nuclear programme‚Äù.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. ‚ÄúAnd the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,‚Äù he said.

Then, Biden added: ‚ÄúIn consultation with our allies and partners, we‚Äôre going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran‚Äôs nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.‚Äù He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal ‚Äì France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China ‚Äì to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
940,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja‚Äôi Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband‚Äôs aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: ‚ÄúThe procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.‚Äù

The UN said he had been ‚Äúreportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process‚Äù and then ‚Äúforced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras‚Äù.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilm√®s, Belgium‚Äôs deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to ‚Äúdiscuss consular issues‚Äù on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

Wilm√®s also condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last Friday. Iran claimed on Thursday to have identified the individuals responsible for bringing weapons into the country, but gave no details.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
941,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"The drastic step was judged the best way to fix systemic problems after an affair similar to allegations against Australian forces in Afghanistan

A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation‚Äôs special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada‚Äôs so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada‚Äôs elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

Australians should not dismiss war crimes scandal as just a few 'bad apples', expert says Read more

The Canadian soldiers took horrific ‚Äútrophy‚Äù photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada‚Äôs own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada‚Äôs defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette ‚Äì who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take ‚Äì said that in Canada‚Äôs case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut if you‚Äôre looking at the experience that we had, where there were ‚Ä¶ war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn‚Äôt think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it‚Äôs actually worked out.‚Äù

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

‚ÄúIn a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn‚Äôt seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,‚Äù Collenette said.

He said Canada‚Äôs approach ‚Äì disbandment coupled with major organisational reform ‚Äì has been ‚Äúvery successful‚Äù.

Photo reveals Australian soldier drinking beer out of dead Taliban fighter's prosthetic leg Read more

No Canadian government ‚Äì conservative or liberal ‚Äì has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

‚ÄúIt was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we‚Äôd fought in world wars, and we‚Äôd never had anything like this.‚Äù

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

‚ÄúEven when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,‚Äù Collenette said. ‚ÄúWe did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it‚Äôs 25 years after the fact.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
942,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary‚Äôs prime minister, Viktor Orb√°n, has condemned the behaviour of MEP J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Sz√°jer‚Äôs participation in a ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

‚ÄúWhat our representative, J√≥zsef Sz√°jer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,‚Äù said Orb√°n on Wednesday evening. He said Sz√°jer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orb√°n‚Äôs government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Sz√°jer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary‚Äôs constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium‚Äôs coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Sz√°jer‚Äôs resignation. ‚ÄúHe made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,‚Äù it read.

Prior to Orb√°n‚Äôs intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

‚ÄúMr Sz√°jer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,‚Äù said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Sz√°jer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region‚Äôs deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him ‚Äúfleeing along the gutter‚Äù to escape the raid.

Sz√°jer admitted he had been at a ‚Äúhouse party‚Äù but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Sz√°jer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an ‚Äúopen secret‚Äù among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Sz√°jer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. ‚ÄúI always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something ‚Äì just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,‚Äù he said. He added that guests had been ‚Äúcompletely naked‚Äù at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Sz√°jer for possession of drugs. But the ‚Äúgay orgy‚Äù element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Sz√°jer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Sz√°jer boasted that he had drafted Hungary‚Äôs new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as ‚Äúa 21st-century constitution‚Äù when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Sz√°jer said: ‚ÄúIt depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don‚Äôt think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.‚Äù

In the intervening decade, Orb√°n‚Äôs government has gone further in its ‚Äútraditional values‚Äù drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed ‚Äútoo gay‚Äù for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orb√°n‚Äôs government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, ‚Äúthe mother is a woman and the father is a man‚Äù. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government‚Äôs justification for the amendment explained that ‚Äúnew, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development‚Äù.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Sz√°jer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making ‚Äúa huge political deal out of a sex scandal‚Äù and praised Sz√°jer‚Äôs statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary‚Äôs government.

943,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 13 and a half months over protest,[],"The high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong will spend more than a year in jail over an unauthorised protest outside police headquarters in June last year, a court in the city has ruled.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong‚Äôs recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

‚ÄúThe court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court‚Äôs view, made the case more serious,‚Äù the judge said.

Hong Kong‚Äôs mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: ‚ÄúEveryone hang in there, add oil,‚Äù using a phrase of encouragement meaning ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go‚Äù commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: ‚ÄúI will hang in there.‚Äù

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù in his stomach, according to a post on the activist‚Äôs social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday‚Äôs sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong‚Äôs pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day ‚Äúumbrella movement‚Äù protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted ‚Äúanother blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong‚Äù.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. ‚ÄúI urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,‚Äù he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong‚Äôs arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù and described it as ‚Äúanother example of HK authorities targeting activists‚Äù.

Wong has maintained a defiant approach during the court case, saying last week: ‚ÄúI am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.‚Äù

He also urged people to focus on the plight of the ‚ÄúHong Kong 12‚Äù, the detained group accused of attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat in August. They have been held in a mainland detention centre ever since, with their families accusing authorities of denying the group access to lawyers, visitors, or medical treatment.

Chow, who gave up her British citizenship to run in Hong Kong elections, was one of the first Demosisto politicians barred from standing for office because the party advocated ‚Äúself-determination‚Äù.

One of her most successful roles has been bringing international attention to Hong Kong‚Äôs democracy movement, aided by her fluency in English, Cantonese and Japanese. She built a huge social media following in Japan in particular. Chow was arrested in August under the national security law, on the vague suspicion of ‚Äúcolluding with foreign forces‚Äù.

At least 31 people have been arrested under the national security law imposed by Beijing in late June, which outlaws a broad range of acts as sedition, secession, foreign collusion, and terrorism.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
944,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim‚Äôs daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother‚Äôs death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies R√©publicaines de S√©curit√© (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: ‚ÄúDirect fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.‚Äù

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had ‚Äúfractures of the entire right hemifacial bone‚Äù. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim‚Äôs chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane‚Äôs apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded ‚Äúthe weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police‚Äù. It added: ‚ÄúThere is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired‚Äù, and concluded the grenade had ‚Äúhit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection‚Äù.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that ‚Äúthere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas‚Äù. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

‚ÄúThere was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,‚Äù the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: ‚ÄúIt was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.‚Äù

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. ‚ÄúShe was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,‚Äù Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

‚ÄúThe police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.‚Äù

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

‚ÄúThis is a political issue. It‚Äôs important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

‚ÄúMr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.‚Äù

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by ‚Äúscientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts‚Äù who had examined the ‚Äúangle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,‚Äù he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
945,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November‚Äôs presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

‚ÄúNot a day goes by where there‚Äôs not a crowd outside,‚Äù Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump‚Äôs election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous,‚Äù was Giuliani‚Äôs response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani‚Äôs 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business‚Äôs branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

‚ÄúThis is a construction yard, that‚Äôs a liability,‚Äù Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

‚ÄúIt did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‚ÄòWho knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?‚Äô‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians‚Äô incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the case,‚Äù said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

‚ÄúI gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.‚Äù

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a ‚ÄúPowerBall‚Äù number of 10 were the South African national lottery‚Äôs winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (¬£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

‚ÄúCongratulations to tonight‚Äôs 20 winners of PowerBall draw,‚Äù the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThese numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.‚Äù

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

‚ÄúLotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,‚Äù posted one Twitter user. ‚Äú20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,‚Äù ventured another. ‚ÄúAbsolutely no way in hell that‚Äôs a coincidence.‚Äù

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma‚Äôs nine-year tenure.

South Africa‚Äôs National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review ‚Äúand if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that‚Äù.

‚ÄúSo we are in the process of doing that currently.‚Äù

947,Trump lawyer: ex-election security chief Krebs should be 'taken out and shot',[],"A former head of US election security who said Donald Trump‚Äôs defeat by Joe Biden was not subject to voter fraud should be ‚Äútaken out at dawn and shot‚Äù, a Trump campaign lawyer said.

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a ‚Äúmob attorney‚Äù.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump‚Äôs claims, ‚Äúwas the most secure in American history‚Äù.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump‚Äôs conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit ‚Äì and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

‚ÄúAnybody who thinks the election went well,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúlike that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.‚Äù

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to ‚Äúundermine democracy ‚Ä¶ to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people‚Äù.

Trump called that interview ‚Äúridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke‚Äù.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president‚Äôs disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump‚Äôs legal team was ‚Äútalking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I‚Äôve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

‚ÄúYou know, they‚Äôre going to have to be dealt with politically. It‚Äôs the only way you deal with these people.‚Äù

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden‚Äôs win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova‚Äôs remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: ‚ÄúThreats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It‚Äôs behavior befitting a mob attorney.‚Äù

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made ‚Äúa retaliatory threat involving Krebs‚Äô official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351‚Äù.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù and DiGenova should ‚Äúface disbarment at least‚Äù.

Trump‚Äôs comments appeared to acknowledge that he thought he could have lost the election. While speculation about a presidential run in 2024 has been rife, and many US politics watchers expect him to declare a bid soon, he has not spoken publicly about it before.

The video was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee of the party, Pam Pollard, who is national committee member for the Oklahoma GOP. The footage showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks. Coughing could be heard.

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors ‚Äì violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president‚Äôs aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady‚Äôs spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, ‚Äúwhile providing the safest environment possible.‚Äù She said that would include smaller guest lists, that ‚Äúmasks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.‚Äù

‚ÄúAttending the parties will be a very personal choice,‚Äù she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

‚ÄúIf the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,‚Äù Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms‚Äô content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a ‚Äúmust-pass‚Äù because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won‚Äôt agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

Joe Biden, the US president-elect, formally introduced his top economic advisers on Tuesday, as his incoming administration prepares to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Bipartisan group pitches $908bn Covid-19 relief to break deadlock in Congress Read more

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to create a recovery for everybody,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúOur message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he ‚Äúmight have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical‚Äù about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

‚ÄúLost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an American tragedy and it‚Äôs essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.‚Äù

Biden‚Äôs nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world‚Äôs population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths ‚Äì more than 268,000 ‚Äì with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: ‚ÄúThe team I‚Äôm announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.‚Äù

His ‚ÄúBuild Back Better‚Äù plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: ‚ÄúReward hard work in America, not wealth. It‚Äôs time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs. It‚Äôs time we addressed the structural inequities in our economy that this pandemic has laid bare.‚Äù

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Neera a long time,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúA brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.‚Äù

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a ‚Äúsacrificial lamb‚Äù, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it‚Äôs a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that‚Äôs dumb.‚Äù

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders‚Äôs 2020 campaign, tweeted: ‚ÄúEverything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.‚Äù

For Biden, Tuesday‚Äôs sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump‚Äôs false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden‚Äôs victory, meaning Trump‚Äôs legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

Joe Biden‚Äôs victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump‚Äôs longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden‚Äôs nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

‚ÄúToday I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,‚Äù Wisconsin‚Äôs governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. ‚ÄúI want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.‚Äù

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden‚Äôs lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin‚Äôs Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.‚Äù

Five factors that helped US democracy resist Trump's election onslaught Read more

Kaul noted that Trump‚Äôs recount targeted only the state‚Äôs two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. ‚ÄúI have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn‚Äôt a game of gotcha.‚Äù

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state‚Äôs 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden‚Äôs overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump‚Äôs legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden‚Äôs narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

Susan Glasser (@sbg1) The 2020 election is over again, with certifications today in Arizona and Wisconsin. After last week's certifications in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. all of the states where Trump has launched spurious claims against the outcome have now certified Biden's victory.

Arizona‚Äôs Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

‚ÄúWe do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,‚Äù Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election ‚Äúwas conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona‚Äôs laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary‚Äù.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump‚Äôs lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the ‚Äúgreatest scam ever perpetrated against our country‚Äù. When he mentioned Ducey‚Äôs name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of ‚Äúrushing to sign‚Äù papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: ‚ÄúArizona won‚Äôt forget what Ducey just did.‚Äù

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: ‚ÄúWhy is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.‚Äù

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone‚Äôs ringtone for calls from the White House is ‚ÄúHail to the Chief‚Äù, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

952,Mexico: L√≥pez Obrador says pandemic lockdowns are the tactic of dictators,[],"Mexicos‚Äôs President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador suggested on Wednesday that politicians who impose lockdowns or curfews to limit Covid-19 are acting like dictators.

The comments came as L√≥pez Obrador once again fended off questions about why he almost never wears a face mask, saying it was a question of liberty.

The Mexican leader said pandemic measures that limit people‚Äôs movements are ‚Äúfashionable among authorities ‚Ä¶ who want to show they are heavy-handed, dictatorship.

‚ÄúA lot of them are letting their authoritarian instincts show,‚Äù he said, adding ‚Äúthe fundamental thing is to guarantee liberty.‚Äù

L√≥pez Obrador‚Äôs comments came a day after the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that Mexico was ‚Äúin bad shape‚Äù with the pandemic and urged its leaders to take the coronavirus seriously.

‚ÄúThe number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,‚Äù said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, on Monday.

‚ÄúWe would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ‚Ä¶‚Äù

In his commments on Wednesday, it was unclear if the Mexican leader was referring to authorities in other countries, or the mainly opposition-party local leaders in Mexico.

Many governments across the world have effectively implemented lockdowns or limits on when people can leave their homes, something L√≥pez Obrador has fiercely resisted doing, arguing some people live day-to-day on what they earn on the streets.

Some local governments in Mexico have tried to use police to enforce limits on masks or movement, which resulted in scandals of abusive behavior by police.

L√≥pez Obrador argues such measures should be voluntary.

‚ÄúEveryone is free. Whoever wants to wear a face mask and feel safer is welcome to do so,‚Äù L√≥pez Obrador said.

The Mexican government has gone against the grain of international anti-virus practices in two ways. It has offered changing and contradictory advice on the utility of wearing face masks, and has described mass testing as wasteful and pointless.

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

It said the pandemic had already triggered ‚Äúunprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour‚Äù and warned of a new wave of criminal activity ‚Äúin relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines‚Äù.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs ‚Äúplan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives‚Äù, the Interpol secretary general, J√ºrgen Stock, said.

‚ÄúIt is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,‚Äù he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of ‚Äúunauthorised and falsified‚Äù coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

‚ÄúThe goal is to avoid French citizens getting contaminated. That will be done by performing random checks at the borders,‚Äù Castex told French television, adding that returning holidaymakers would be ordered to quarantine for seven days.

While Alpine resorts in France will technically be open over Christmas, ski lifts and other essential winter sports infrastructure, as well as bars and restaurants, will not as the country strives to avoid fuelling a third wave of the coronavirus.

Italy and Germany share the French position and have indicated, to the fury of many local businesses, that their pistes will remain in effect closed over the Christmas and new year periods, which can account for up to 20% of some resorts‚Äô income.

The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, last week joined Italy‚Äôs prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, in calling for a Europe-wide shutdown of winter sports until 10 January.

Coronavirus clusters in Alpine resorts such as Austria‚Äôs Ischgl played a key role in the spread of the virus during the first wave of the pandemic earlier this year, with holidaymakers bringing Covid-19 back home following ski trips abroad.

Austria also said on Wednesday that while skiing could resume on 24 December, lift capacity would be limited, bars, restaurants, and hotels would remain largely closed until January, and people entering the country from abroad would have to quarantine.

The measures in effect mean skiiing will only be possible over the holiday season for locals who live close to the slopes. The chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, said it should be possible ‚Äúfor a large part of our population to go skiing at least for the day‚Äù.

Conte asked Italians not to take to the slopes at all during the Christmas holidays, and called on all other European countries with major winter sports sectors to agree common rules to prevent cases being imported if Italy‚Äôs pistes stayed closed.

‚ÄúIt will not be possible to allow winter sports holidays this year, we cannot afford it,‚Äù the Italian prime minister said, arguing that despite a strict safety protocol devised by operators, ‚Äúeverything revolving around holidays on the snow is uncontrollable‚Äù.

Switzerland and Spain, however, have so far proved reluctant to impose restrictions. The Swiss interior minister, Alain Berset, said last week the country was ‚Äúautonomous. We can decide for ourselves whether we leave ski areas open. But we know what‚Äôs at stake.‚Äù

The Swiss government is expected to formally announce its position on limiting foreign visitors on Friday, while the Spanish government is still consulting with its autonomous regions on what measures to take.

Castex said on Wednesday that Switzerland and Spain were ‚Äúnot thus far falling into line‚Äù, but that ‚Äúdiplomatic action is continuing ‚Äì the die has not been completely cast‚Äù. He said he would continue ‚Äúto protect my fellow citizens by preventing them from going to contaminate themselves‚Äù, adding that the French measures were also ‚Äúabout being fair to French resort managers‚Äù.

One French resort, Ch√¢tel in the Franco-Swiss Portes du Soleil ski area, has draped Swiss flags around the village in protest against France‚Äôs stance. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a problem with a French government that shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,‚Äù the mayor, Nicolas Rubin, said.

Macron had indicated on Tuesday that the French government was considering taking ‚Äúrestrictive and dissuasive measures‚Äù to prevent the French from going abroad to ski, especially in Switzerland, over the holiday period.

The World Health Organization‚Äôs emergencies chief, Michael Ryan, said this week that the risk of catching Covid-19 while actually skiing was minimal. ‚ÄúI suspect many people won‚Äôt be infected barrelling down the slopes on their skis,‚Äù he said.

But he said the real risks ‚Äúare going to come at airports, tour buses taking people to and from ski resorts, ski lifts ... and places where people come together‚Äù. The WHO was advising all countries to ‚Äúlook at their ski season‚Äù, he said, warning that indoor socialising after skiing might pose a particular threat.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the ‚Äúcertain knowledge‚Äù that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that ‚Äúthe scientists have done it‚Äù, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with ‚Äúover-optimism‚Äù, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúWe have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.‚Äù

There were still ‚Äúimmense logistical challenges‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúSo it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it‚Äôs all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we‚Äôre not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.‚Äù

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning‚Äôs press conference announcing the vaccine‚Äôs approval. ‚ÄúAnd what a momentous ‚Ä¶ journey and international effort it has been,‚Äù Van-Tam said. ‚ÄúDiscovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.‚Äù

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. ‚ÄúIf we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‚ÄòOh, the vaccine‚Äôs here, let‚Äôs abandon caution,‚Äô all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.‚Äù

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a ‚Äúcomplex product‚Äù and ‚Äúreally tricky to handle‚Äù, explaining: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.‚Äù

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was ‚Äúgoing to eradicate coronavirus ever‚Äù, but we may get to the point where it becomes ‚Äúa seasonal problem‚Äù like flu. He added: ‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party ‚Ä¶ and say, ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us,‚Äô like the end of the war? No, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

UK coronavirus live: Johnson confirms it will take months until most of vulnerable group are vaccinated Read more

The UK has purchased 40m doses of the Pfizer jab ‚Äì enough for 20 million people, as it is administered with two injections 21 days apart. The vaccine, which must be stored at -70C, complicating distribution, has been shown to have 95% efficacy in its final trials. An initial 800,000 doses will be made available next week, and millions more will follow in the coming weeks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
956,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to ‚Äúsure and certain knowledge that we will succeed‚Äù after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel ‚Äúquite emotional‚Äù.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected ‚Äì including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions ‚Äì it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

‚ÄúBecause of Brexit, we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,‚Äù Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK ‚Äì and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law ‚Äì but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of ‚Äúworld-beating‚Äù UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,‚Äù he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid ‚Äúoveroptimism‚Äù and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England‚Äôs lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

‚ÄúIt will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,‚Äù he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it‚Äôs going to be with humankind forever,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúDo I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs it, it‚Äôs behind us!‚Äô like the end of the war?

‚ÄúNo I don‚Äôt. I think those kind of habits, that we‚Äôve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.‚Äù

Johnson responded: ‚ÄúThat may be a good thing ‚Ä¶ on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.‚Äù

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called ‚Äúa real cause for concern‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,‚Äù he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said ‚Äúeveryone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut‚Äù in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.‚Äù

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

‚ÄúThis authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
957,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own ‚Äúrobust‚Äù approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù, contrasting the UK approach with the ‚Äúpace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly‚Äù.

The EMA said the bloc‚Äôs member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the ‚Äúappropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens‚Äô access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns‚Äù.

Germany‚Äôs health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

‚ÄúThe idea is not that we‚Äôre the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,‚Äù he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. ‚ÄúWe have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we‚Äôd wanted to,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.‚Äù

The EMA‚Äôs statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included ‚Äúessential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign‚Äù.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation ‚Äúare not expected to affect significantly vaccines‚Äô availability‚Äù. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. ‚ÄúIn years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity‚Äôs charge against this disease,‚Äù he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany‚Äôs ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: ‚ÄúWhy is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don‚Äôt think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.‚Äù

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: ‚ÄúWe may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.‚Äù

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: ‚ÄúIf you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.‚Äù

June Raine, the head of the MHRA, defended its decision. ‚ÄúThe way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards,‚Äù she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
958,Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans,[],"Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a ‚Äúsuper-spreader event‚Äù.

The gathering, called ‚ÄúNaughty in N‚Äôawlins‚Äù saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event‚Äôs organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

‚ÄúIf I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,‚Äù Hannaford wrote.

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.‚Äù

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N‚Äôawlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

‚ÄúWhen we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,‚Äù Hannaford said.

‚ÄúIn almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‚ÄòFuck it, it‚Äôs our last day‚Äô and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.‚Äù

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

‚ÄúWe did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‚ÄòNo Dancing‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúBut you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn‚Äôt really outlaw dancing.

‚ÄúBut seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

959,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan‚Äôs Princess Mako ‚Äì the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne ‚Äì and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom‚Äôs mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan‚Äôs royals; it has also brought the country‚Äôs succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro‚Äôs mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako‚Äôs father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

‚ÄúI approve of them getting married,‚Äù he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. ‚ÄúThe constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.‚Äù

But, he added, Komuro‚Äôs family needed to make a ‚Äúvisible‚Äù response to his mother‚Äôs financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, I don‚Äôt think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]‚Äù ‚Äì adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor‚Äôs daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively ‚Äúordinary‚Äù life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan‚Äôs succession laws, no female member of the imperial family ‚Äì not even the emperor‚Äôs 19-year-old daughter, Aiko ‚Äì can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako‚Äôs younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other ‚Äúirreplaceable‚Äù, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as ‚Äúsomeone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
960,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it‚Äôs been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK‚Äôs first female prime minister?

It‚Äôs a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council‚Äôs controversial decision to underwrite a ¬£100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: ‚ÄúWe find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúShe was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country‚Äôs has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.‚Äù

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a long hard road. There‚Äôs been a few knocks and bumps along the way,‚Äù Schonhut said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice to see things finally coming to fruition.‚Äù

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a bit like a mini Brexit,‚Äù she said. She hopes it‚Äôll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . ‚ÄúIn the area we‚Äôre living in we‚Äôre seeing a huge number of homeless people, we‚Äôre seeing food banks springing up all over the place.‚Äù

Burgess added that given Thatcher‚Äôs controversial legacy it was a ‚Äúpoorly judged decision‚Äù to push ahead with the statue. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.‚Äù

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

‚ÄúI appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it‚Äôs a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.‚Äù

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. ‚ÄúThe first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.‚Äù

He added: ‚ÄúI think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
961,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world‚Äôs biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, ‚Äúa lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?‚Äù Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry ‚Äì but rarely their male counterparts ‚Äì have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because ‚Äúpeople wouldn‚Äôt find a mother as appealing‚Äù. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had ‚Äúunderestimated this whole mommy thing‚Äù.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry‚Äôs disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children‚Äôs perspective on her last album (‚ÄúYou say you‚Äôre going but you don‚Äôt say how long for / You say it‚Äôs work, but I‚Äôm not sure‚Äù). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US ‚Äúnearly tore me apart‚Äù, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds ‚Äì leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms ‚Äì moving from the ‚Äúfemale pop star‚Äù category to the even more restrictive ‚Äúmum‚Äù box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

‚ÄúI hardly ever get asked about being a father,‚Äù says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter‚Äôs future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly‚Äôs Tom Fletcher ‚Äì whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I‚Äôm a Celebrity ‚Ä¶ contestant Giovanna Fletcher ‚Äì says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

‚ÄòWe knew we could have a support structure‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Thurston Moore and daughter Coco in 1995. Photograph: John Zich/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‚ÄòWow, I‚Äôm going to be responsible for another human being.‚Äô So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.‚Äù Hot Chip‚Äôs Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children ‚Äúget upset when I am about to go away‚Äù, they ‚Äúunderstand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want‚Äù.

It‚Äôs not only their own family‚Äôs financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for ‚Äì their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to let anyone down by saying, ‚Äòit would be great to do that festival, but we can‚Äôt because I can‚Äôt,‚Äô‚Äù he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. ‚ÄúI think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it‚Äôs our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.‚Äù

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician‚Äôs living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by ‚Äúspeeding back during the night‚Äù after shows, and then ‚Äúdoing the school run in the morning‚Äù. Do his peers see that as normal? ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he laughs. ‚ÄúThey think that‚Äôs mad!‚Äù Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives‚Äô respective due dates, but it wasn‚Äôt ideal. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre in a band, people expect to see you on stage,‚Äù says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,‚Äù he later said. Fletcher ‚Äì who had his first child ‚Äútwo weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career‚Äù ‚Äì was equally untroubled by the experience. ‚ÄúIt actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.‚Äù

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. ‚ÄúAbout 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live ‚Äì we drove our family car with him,‚Äù he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife‚Äôs mother) travelled ‚Äúall around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe‚Äù, an undertaking he describes as ‚Äúpretty easy‚Äù and ‚Äúnot too hectic‚Äù.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sin√©ad O‚ÄôConnor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth‚Äôs huge success during the decade: ‚ÄúWe made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.‚Äù Any earlier ‚Äúwould have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.‚Äù Fletcher‚Äôs experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. ‚ÄúEveryone was there to give us everything we needed.‚Äù

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. ‚ÄúThe only person who would ever do that is a band‚Äôs manager and they might say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs going to impact on our finances‚Äô or whatever,‚Äù says Goddard. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.‚Äù The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. ‚ÄúHot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,‚Äù Goddard says. ‚ÄúThe band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.‚Äù Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules ‚Äúpretty challenging‚Äù, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out‚Äù.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of ‚Äúmum guilt‚Äù ‚Äì the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children ‚Äì men have the much milder husband guilt. ‚ÄúMy worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,‚Äù says Spearman, with Goddard adding: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have ‚Äì my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn‚Äôt have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.‚Äù

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,‚Äù says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn‚Äôt mind him taking paternity leave, ‚Äúif a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that‚Äôs different.‚Äù Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop ‚Äì ‚Äúthere are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older‚Äù ‚Äì as well as ‚Äúthe hormones, what happens to your body‚Äù that men don‚Äôt experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don‚Äôt have any children: ‚ÄúMen don‚Äôt really get those questions: ‚ÄòAre you going to settle down and have a child?‚Äô Women must be asked about it all the time.‚Äù When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. ‚ÄúI would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‚ÄòI probably will have some kids.‚Äô‚Äù

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon‚Äôs work ‚Äúwas going to be interrupted‚Äù. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be focused, but it‚Äôs also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It‚Äôs not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.‚Äù Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact ‚Äì albeit only temporarily. ‚ÄúHaving a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything ‚Äì what my daughter would think in years to come.‚Äù

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.‚Äù Ghetts says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood‚Äôs cool, fatherhood‚Äôs sick‚Äù.

Goddard is more ambivalent. ‚ÄúMy coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.‚Äù Spearman says Everything Everything didn‚Äôt want to mention fatherhood ‚Äútoo much‚Äù in the press release for their new album, ‚Äúbecause it makes us look a bit old. And it‚Äôs a bit of cliche to be like, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôve written a record about having a kid,‚Äô which is not what our record is about. We don‚Äôt want to overstate it.‚Äù

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven‚Äôt noticed any real-world implications yet. ‚ÄúWe got playlisted on Radio 1,‚Äù he says happily. ‚ÄúNot bad for a dad band!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
962,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite ‚Äì it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It‚Äôs the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I‚Äôve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I‚Äôve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali‚Äôs fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis‚Äô days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone‚Äôs view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn‚Äôt show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I‚Äôd show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn‚Äôt have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy ‚Äì most photographers don‚Äôt hang around the magazine‚Äôs photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn‚Äôt mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali‚Äôs head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali‚Äôs next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you‚Äôd ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there ‚Äì I went with him once. They‚Äôd wind him up saying: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!‚Äù He‚Äôd reply: ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôd have had him in two rounds!‚Äù

I can count on one hand the athletes I‚Äôve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson‚Äôs disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the greatest picture!‚Äù He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist‚Äôs ear ‚Äì but it was the same exclusive he‚Äôd just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We‚Äôd do a studio shot and he‚Äôd say ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you 20 minutes‚Äù ‚Äì then an hour later he‚Äôd still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better ‚Äì maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I‚Äôve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

963,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. ‚ÄúTo come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,‚Äù he said.

Watt‚Äôs photographs of the forest ‚Äì and the grim aftermath of logging ‚Äì are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the ‚Äúgraveyard of stumps‚Äù in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we‚Äôre allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúA lot of people are shocked that that‚Äôs still happening here. It‚Äôs not illegal. The government sanctions it.‚Äù

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province‚Äôs southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island‚Äôs original old growth forests ‚Äì where Watt shot his before-and-after series ‚Äì are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) ‚Äì or about 1% of the deferred areas ‚Äì is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,‚Äù said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. ‚ÄúThat means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.‚Äù

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep taking these ‚Äòbefore‚Äô photos,‚Äù said Watt. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs up to politicians if there‚Äôs going to be an ‚Äòafter‚Äô shot.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
964,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‚ÄòLet‚Äôs get it over with,‚Äù sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan‚Äôs Netflix epic. Firstly, it‚Äôs just as well The Crown isn‚Äôt on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation‚Äôs enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman‚Äôs Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia ‚Äì not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there‚Äôs nothing. Well, there‚Äôs Prince Charles but Josh O‚ÄôConnor‚Äôs portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons‚Äô Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn‚Äôt so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen‚Äôs children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana‚Äôs arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù on offer. It‚Äôs a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts ‚Äì for example, there‚Äôs no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II‚Äôs sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted ‚ÄúThe Firm‚Äù in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn‚Äôt they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling ‚Äì which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed ‚Äúfairytale‚Äù wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it‚Äôs simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there‚Äôs no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures ‚Äì such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II‚Äôs successor refusing to sign a bill into law ‚Äì or mined Britain‚Äôs deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV‚Äôs Victoria and BBC/Showtime‚Äôs The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you‚Äôre watching. In the latest series, there‚Äôs a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew ‚Äì then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal ‚Äì talks to the Queen about his private life. ‚ÄúI was shocked,‚Äù she later reflects to her husband. ‚ÄúIf he doesn‚Äôt change ‚Ä¶‚Äù The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function ‚Äì and the aesthetics ‚Äì of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple‚Äôs courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4‚Äôs comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show‚Äôs writers have recognised that she doesn‚Äôt belong in that world ‚Äì a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it‚Äôs obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there‚Äôs a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic ‚Äì the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period ‚Äì the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there‚Äôs a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan‚Äôs withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations ‚Äì of royals and commoners alike ‚Äì might well wonder whether it‚Äôs all worth it.

965,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I‚Äôm going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you‚Äôre going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They‚Äôve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It‚Äôs too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That‚Äôs fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it‚Äôs too much. It‚Äôs not right. They‚Äôve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don‚Äôt have all the best words to do this because I‚Äôm angry. And the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job ‚Ä¶ in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he‚Äôs one of the better ones they‚Äôve got. His family‚Äôs getting harassed now. There‚Äôs a noose out there with his name on it, and it‚Äôs just not right.

I‚Äôve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It‚Äôs just wrong. I can‚Äôt begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

Mr President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We‚Äôre investigating, there‚Äôs always a possibility, I get it. You have the rights to go to the courts. What you don‚Äôt have the ability to do ‚Äì and you need to step up and say this ‚Äì is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed, and it‚Äôs not right. It‚Äôs not right ‚Ä¶ all of this is wrong.

DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former US attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better. Mr President, as the secretary said yesterday, people aren‚Äôt giving you the best advice of what‚Äôs actually going on on the ground. It‚Äôs time to look forward. If you want to run for re-election in four years, fine ‚Äì do it. But everything we‚Äôre seeing right now, there‚Äôs not a path. Be the bigger man here, and step in. Tell your supporters: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be violent. Don‚Äôt intimidate.‚Äù All that‚Äôs wrong. It‚Äôs un-American.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
966,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government‚Äôs ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It‚Äôs both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I‚Äôve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I‚Äôm torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year‚Äôs Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn‚Äôt going to stop transmission. It‚Äôs best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you‚Äôre likely to smell the smoke. It‚Äôs the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area ‚Äì the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you‚Äôre not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they‚Äôre not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government‚Äôs decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn‚Äôt worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I‚Äôm less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
967,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever ‚Äúour‚Äù is and whenever that ‚Äúday‚Äù might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: ‚ÄúOh God, we‚Äôre doing anarchism at the moment ‚Äì it‚Äôs so boring.‚Äù How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism‚Äôs central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there‚Äôs a T-shirt slogan there, I‚Äôm sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father‚Äôs wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. ‚ÄúOf course she wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening‚Äôs source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter‚Äôs adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

‚ÄúHow are you doing, Ryan?‚Äù

‚ÄúLiving the dream,‚Äù he said happily. ‚ÄúLiving the dream.‚Äù

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself ‚Äúto the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active‚Äù. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a ‚Äúmisconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There‚Äôs definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we‚Äôve got a few Thatcherites in our class.‚Äù

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren‚Äôt born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? ‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs everything, isn‚Äôt it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.‚Äù Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this ¬£17,000-a-year establishment, she said: ‚ÄúThere were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I‚Äôve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.‚Äù No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: ‚ÄúI feel awful.‚Äù There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama‚Äôs inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that‚Äôs quite a start. ‚ÄúThings have deteriorated quite significantly since then,‚Äù he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it‚Äôs never like that.‚Äù

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can‚Äôt bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of ‚Äúreal‚Äù politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it ‚Äúinteresting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.‚Äù

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view ‚Äì or those of your tribe ‚Äì and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: ‚ÄúNothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.‚Äù

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

968,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it,[],"When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday‚Äôs news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson‚Äôs administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours ‚Äì a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn‚Äôt really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government‚Äôs proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone ‚Äì regardless of nationality or political affiliation ‚Äì is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
969,The Guardian view on Poland‚Äôs Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Krak√≥w, Marek Jƒôdraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government‚Äôs refusal to sign off on the European Union‚Äôs Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial ‚Äúrule of law‚Äù clause, Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a ‚Äúneo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God‚Äôs kingdom‚Äù. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender ‚Äúideology‚Äù in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jƒôdraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October‚Äôs controversial abortion ruling by Poland‚Äôs constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops‚Äô conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS‚Äôs leader, Jaros≈Çaw Kaczy≈Ñski, called on Poles to ‚Äúdefend the church at any price‚Äù. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church‚Äôs authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II‚Äôs judgment was criticised in last month‚Äôs Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope‚Äôs secretary, Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church‚Äôs steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczy≈Ñski, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orb√°n‚Äôs Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to ‚Äúabandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance‚Äù. Their statement denounced attempts to ‚Äúexploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party‚Äù. If the country‚Äôs ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
970,Covid has shown me what lies beyond boredom: post-boredom,[],"I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. ‚ÄúGood, thanks. You?‚Äù I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. ‚ÄúWhat did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see, umm ‚Ä¶ got really into jigsaws for a bit. Rearranged the spare room into an office. Learned to make this one really good curry recipe from the BBC website. Uh ‚Ä¶ got 11 solo wins and about 24 duo wins on Fortnite.‚Äù Is that good?, they‚Äôll ask, and I‚Äôll have to admit that no, not particularly. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a game for 12-year-olds that I play compulsively,‚Äù I‚Äôll explain. ‚ÄúEvery day I log in and let adolescents embarrass me in an online world that allows them to dance joyously on the remains of my corpse.‚Äù Oh, they‚Äôll say. I think there‚Äôs something ‚Äì I think there‚Äôs something happening in the other room. I really ought to‚Ä¶

I think it‚Äôs important to address the fact that I am bored. I am, to my bones, bored of this. I know that in the current climate, being bored is a high luxury, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any more thrilling. In fact, I am so deep into boredom that I have burrowed beneath the previously accepted boundaries of the concept, and have now emerged, apathetically, into post-boredom.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a ‚Äúsign of a life falling apart‚Äù to something I was doing ‚Äúfor the moral good of the country and the world as a whole‚Äù, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I‚Äôd thrive in the ambient boredom of prison ‚Äì not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I‚Äôd get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That‚Äôs not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I‚Äôm not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one ‚Äì no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing ‚Äì but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it‚Äôs psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it‚Äôs possibly even worse that we‚Äôve worn boredom down to the bone. If we‚Äôve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself ‚Äì someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something ‚Äì the answer can only be ‚Äúchaos‚Äù.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won‚Äôt be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much ‚Äì stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it‚Äôs hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We‚Äôre all tiptoeing around the idea that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It‚Äôs hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I‚Äôm certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

971,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we‚Äôve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world‚Äôs human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We‚Äôve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some ¬£1.5bn of the UK‚Äôs commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it‚Äôs coming under threat from the government‚Äôs proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don‚Äôt yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map ‚Äì it‚Äôs also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged ¬£7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world‚Äôs most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested ¬£12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed ¬£120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network‚Äôs priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We‚Äôve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, ‚ÄúAntimicrobial resistance ‚Ä¶ threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily‚Äù. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK‚Äôs track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government‚Äôs decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

972,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you‚Äôve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of ‚Äúfair play‚Äù. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of ‚ÄúDivine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.‚Äù

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn‚Äôt include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won‚Äôt spoil the ending for those who haven‚Äôt seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit ‚Äì it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there ‚Äì but somehow it didn‚Äôt really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone‚Äôs accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%‚Äôs mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren‚Äôt one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It‚Äôs weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on ‚Äì giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
973,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found chess cathartic | Nancy Jo Sales",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix‚Äôs series The Queen‚Äôs Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I‚Äôd ever played anyone, I‚Äôd lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I‚Äôm more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I‚Äôd never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it‚Äôs exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I‚Äôve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other ‚Äì sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny‚Äôs funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they‚Äôd ever known.

But it isn‚Äôt always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny‚Äôs escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was ‚Äì he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I‚Äôd been playing chess for a few months ‚Äì first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online ‚Äì I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I‚Äôd started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He‚Äôs the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It‚Äôs a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage ‚Äúfootball without fans is nothing‚Äù is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we‚Äôd either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we‚Äôd have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven‚Äôt done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn‚Äôt it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid ‚Äúunnecessary movement‚Äù. They‚Äôve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there‚Äôs no tomorrow, without having to purchase a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal‚Äôs poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we‚Äôll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language. The Fiver is very much looking forward to it.

980,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC‚Äôs decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn‚Äôt need any ‚Äúverification‚Äù from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

‚ÄúThe shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,‚Äù a BBC spokesperson said. ‚ÄúOn this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.‚Äù

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

‚ÄúThis is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI know who I am and what I‚Äôve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don‚Äôt vote.‚Äù

Fury‚Äôs initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury‚Äôs team offered a farmer ¬£25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I‚Äôm the people‚Äôs champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4 ‚Äî TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 2, 2020

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements ‚Äì citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury‚Äôs team to lie. Fury‚Äôs subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as ‚Äútotal bullshit‚Äù.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury ‚Äì who earlier that year had claimed that ‚Äúthere are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.‚Äù

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn‚Äôt changed his mind. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt enjoy it one bit,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúI turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
981,Spoty: Lewis Hamilton in pole position with Doyle only woman on shortlist,[],"Lewis Hamilton is the overwhelming favourite to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award for a second time after being named on the six‚Äëstrong shortlist, with Tyson Fury and Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan seen as his closest contenders.

Hamilton, who won the award in 2014 and has finished in the top three a record five times, is as short as 1-7 with the bookmakers after winning his seventh F1 title.

Fury, who retained his WBC heavyweight title by knocking out Deontay Wilder, is the second favourite, slightly ahead of O‚ÄôSullivan, who won his sixth world title at the Crucible.

Doyle, who broke her own record for the number of winners ridden by a British woman in a year in 2020, said she was delighted at being shortlisted.

‚ÄúIt is a huge privilege to be nominated for such an illustrious award,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to get my head around being nominated alongside the likes of Lewis Hamilton, but I‚Äôm really pleased that horse racing has been recognised alongside these sports.‚Äù

The 24-year-old, who also rode her first Royal Ascot winner and became the first woman to ride five winners on the same card at odds of 899-1 at Windsor in August, said: ‚ÄúRacing can be in its own little bubble as such, so hopefully this might help to open the door to a wider audience.‚Äù

982,"Mick Schumacher's family name is blessing and a curse, says Damon Hill",[],"Damon Hill has said Mick Schumacher deserves his shot at Formula One success but has warned the son of the seven-times world champion Michael that living up to a family name can be both a blessing and a curse.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill‚Äôs father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher‚Äôs F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

‚ÄúThere is a sense that some people don‚Äôt want you to have a go,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI felt like some people felt: ‚ÄòWhy is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.‚Äô It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.‚Äù

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

‚ÄúI wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad‚Äôs life and career and applied them to my racing.

‚ÄúJacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.‚Äù

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

‚ÄúIt really is tragic what happened to Michael,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúMick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.‚Äù

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

‚ÄúI have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn‚Äôt strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.‚Äù

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher‚Äôs best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

‚ÄúIn a way it‚Äôs very simple ‚Äì if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,‚Äù says Hill. ‚ÄúI will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
983,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed ‚Äúill-judged criticism‚Äù from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been ‚Äúconvicted of racism‚Äù.

Porto‚Äôs move came after City drew 0-0 at the Est√°dio do Drag√£o in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as ‚Äúan opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism‚Äù.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: ‚ÄúHis tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.‚Äù

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto‚Äôs coach Sergio Concei√ß√£o accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Concei√ß√£o described Silva as ‚Äúchildish‚Äù for a tweet that followed City‚Äôs victory in which the midfielder wrote: ‚ÄúThis one felt so good!‚Äù

Porto‚Äôs newsletter claimed Guardiola had a ‚Äúbad disposition after the meeting‚Äù on Tuesday and quoted Concei√ß√£o as saying: ‚ÄúI would also be upset if I couldn‚Äôt win with the team he has and the budget he has.‚Äù

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: ‚ÄúDespite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn‚Äôt buy class or notion.‚Äù In response a City spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

‚ÄúIn 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.‚Äù

The incident referred to came at the Drag√£o in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City‚Äôs XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: ‚ÄúStrange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn‚Äôt going to work. Clearly selective memory, I‚Äôm sure them receiving a fine for targeting Mario in 2012 just a memory.‚Äù

984,LeBron James' $88m contract extension opens possibility of playing alongside son,[],"LeBron James, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to their first NBA title in a decade earlier this year, has agreed a two-year contract extension worth $88m, opening the possibility of him playing in the league at the same time as his son.

James‚Äôs agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James‚Äôs contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year‚Äôs NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The contract extension, once it is made official, will guarantee James career earnings of $429m.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

987,'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration,[],"Spanish archipelago has received 20,000 migrants and refugees this year, 8,000 in the last month

'This lack of humanity can't go on': Canary Islands struggle with huge rise in migration

In the Canary Islands, 2020 will be remembered as more than just the year of the coronavirus.

The streets of Arguinegu√≠n, a small town on the island of Gran Canaria, are thronged not with tourists in search of winter warmth, but with police officers, health workers and journalists, all scurrying to and from the crowded dock, which has become the newest symbol of an old phenomenon.

Almost 15 years after the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù of 2006, when about 36,000 people reached the Spanish archipelago in small and dangerous cayucos, or fishing boats, the Canaries are once again struggling to cope with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees.

Over the past 11 months, about 20,000 people have braved the Atlantic route from Africa to Europe, with more than 8,000 arriving in the Canaries in November alone. Last year, 2,557 migrants arrived in the archipelago, up from 1,307 in 2018.

Nowhere is the strain and chaos more evident than on the dock at Arguinegu√≠n. At the makeshift reception centre, cobbled together four months ago and intended to shelter 500 people, the number of occupants has swelled to almost 2,700 over recent weeks. Arguinegu√≠n, according to official figures, has a population of 2,309.

The people held at the temporary centre ‚Äì officially for a maximum of 72 hours ‚Äì are living in cramped conditions, some in tents, but many sleeping on the sun-baked, rat-infested bare dock. Most of their fellow arrivals have progressed to better-equipped temporary camps farther inland, government reception centres or hotel rooms.

There has been a rise in the use of the Atlantic route this year. Amid enduring conflicts, land border closures forced by the pandemic and increased controls in some north African countries, smuggling gangs have reactivated the long and perilous crossing, ferrying thousands of men, women and children between the two continents.

Those lucky enough to land on the Canaries find themselves pitched into a confused, disjointed and under-resourced system.

Spain‚Äôs public ombudsman has called for the Arguinegu√≠n camp to be shut down at once on the grounds that it could be violating people‚Äôs basic rights.

Last week, a judge decided that while the conditions at the camp were ‚Äúdeplorable‚Äù, they did not constitute a crime. The complaint had been brought by Onalia Bueno, the mayor of the municipality of Mog√°n, of which Arguinegu√≠n is a part.

Bueno despairs at the lack of coordination between central government ministries, citing the events of 17 November in particular. That day, as the dock centre was completely overwhelmed, 200 Moroccans were removed by police, put on buses bound for the island‚Äôs capital, Las Palmas, and left without anywhere to stay.

While the migration ministry finally stepped in and found accommodation for them, Bueno sees the event as symptomatic of a deep and troubling absence of political will.

‚ÄúThis lack of humanity from the government just can‚Äôt go on,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt seem to be able to solve the problem at hand.‚Äù

And yet, she adds, Spain found its way through the ‚Äúcayuco crisis‚Äù in 2006.

Jos√© Segura Clavell, who was the central government‚Äôs representative in the Canaries at the time, says the two situations do not bear comparison. He points out that the pandemic means repatriation flights are impossible, but says the migrants and refugees are not getting the ‚Äúhumanitarian reception‚Äù to which they are entitled.

If, however, Spanish authorities are failing to live up to their obligations, adds Segura, then so is the EU. ‚ÄúThe EU‚Äôs behaviour is a mistake,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a clear common policy.‚Äù

The lack of a clear, common ‚Äì and fair ‚Äì approach to migration was spelt out in the letter that Spain, Italy, Greece and Malta sent to the European commission last week in response to the EU‚Äôs new migration and asylum proposals.

‚ÄúWe believe that the solidarity rules and the related commitment of all member states must be clearly defined,‚Äù the four countries said.

‚ÄúThe frontline member states cannot face the migratory pressure on the whole European Union. We must find feasible and coordinated solutions to our common challenges.‚Äù

In the meantime, the pressure at the Arguinegu√≠n dock is, belatedly, easing. Each day, people are being transferred to a former military camp on the island, which can house up to 1,000 people. But there are fears the winter rains could turn the camp into a mudbath. About 6,000 people ‚Äì including more than 455 unaccompanied children ‚Äì are being put up in hotel rooms paid for by the Spanish government. More than 3,470 of them are staying in 10 hotels in Mog√°n.

But things are far from settled, and tempers far from cool. On Thursday, Bueno issued an ultimatum to the migration ministry, warning that ‚ÄúMog√°n‚Äôs solidarity has a best-before date of 31 December‚Äù and asking the central government to remove the migrants and refugees from hotels and accommodate them elsewhere.

The secretary of state for migrations, Hana Jalloul, said the interior ministry was working to repatriate all those not eligible for asylum, but added that the new arrivals needed to be properly looked after.

‚ÄúIf I left those migrants on the streets right now, social services would have to take responsibility for them,‚Äù Jalloul said on Thursday.

‚ÄúDo you think that the mayor has the resources to house 3,400 migrants?‚Äù

Sylvanus Kamara, a 22-year-old migrant from Sierra Leone, is one of those staying in a hotel. Although the interior ministry ‚Äì which is trying to shut down the dock camp as soon as possible ‚Äì says no one stays on the docks for more than 72 hours, Kamara spent eight days in the camp. On a recent visit, Human Rights Watch spoke to people who had been held there for more than two weeks.

Like many of his fellow migrants, Kamara clambered into a crowded boat in the Senegalese port of Mbour one day in October ‚Äúin search of a future‚Äù. Faced with a lack of work and prospects, he decided to gamble on the dangerous sea crossing, leaving his five-year-old daughter in the care of his sister.

But unlike most of the new arrivals in the Canaries, Kamara has no plans to move to the mainland. One of the few items he brought with him is the strip of the local football team, UD Las Palmas, whose matches he used to watch back home.

Kamara says the Canaries ‚Äì ‚Äúa great place‚Äù ‚Äì remind him of Africa. His dream now is to pick up the nascent football career he left behind in Sierra Leone. He rises at 6am every day to train on the beach 2 miles away and hopes his dedication will pay off.

‚ÄúI was doing my exercises when a trainer from the local team came over and offered me the chance to train with them,‚Äù says Kamara.

Anything more permanent will depend on the young Sierra Leonean sorting out his papers, something the already overstretched Red Cross is trying to help him with.

The frustration and anger expressed by local people and politicians is echoed by some of the NGOs sharing the strain.

For Txema Santana of the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (CEAR), the conversion of the military camp ‚Äújust goes to show that there could have been an alternative to the dock centre a long time ago‚Äù.

Like many others ‚Äì not least the regional president of the Canaries ‚Äì Santana sees clear parallels between what is happening on the archipelago and what has already happened in Lampedusa in Italy, and Lesbos in Greece. The numbers may differ but the response does not: the EU, says Santana, ‚Äúviews island territories as prisons‚Äù.

But for those less fortunate, the Canaries and the waters that lead to them are not prisons, but cemeteries.

In October, at least 140 people died when the boat carrying them from Senegal caught fire and capsized in the deadliest shipwreck recorded so far this year. Last week, eight people died when their boat ran into rocks as they attempted to land on Lanzarote.

According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), at least 563 people have died on the Atlantic route in 2020. That figure does not take into account the Lanzarote deaths, nor the 10 other possible, but unconfirmed, shipwrecks that the IOM is looking into.

‚ÄúUntil we have a safe, legal and organised way for people to move about, we‚Äôre going to carry on seeing these irregular crossings,‚Äù says Santana.

‚ÄúThere will always be people ready to traffic other people and to sell them the dream of reaching another land.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
988,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain‚Äôs new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her ‚Äúdelight, after many years of campaigning,‚Äù that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens‚Äô right to work and live in UK ‚Äì a key Brexit ask ‚Äì or British nationals‚Äô right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

‚ÄúIt will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,‚Äù said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. ‚ÄúI built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is ‚Ä¶ a shock.‚Äù

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell‚Äôs mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and ‚Äì like his sister ‚Äì two dual-nationality children. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very settled; we have careers and families,‚Äù said Jessica. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not thinking of going home yet.‚Äù

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. ‚ÄúMy big worry is my mother,‚Äù Frizell said. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fit and well, but if she needed looking after ‚Ä¶ Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now ‚Äì but not for much longer.‚Äù

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, ‚Äúalmost without restriction‚Äù.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. ‚ÄúAfter that,‚Äù Godfrey said, ‚Äúif you want to come back with your non-British partner, you‚Äôll need to earn ¬£18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they‚Äôll have to meet the new points system.‚Äù

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs ‚Äì NHS surcharges, fees ‚Äì could run into thousands of pounds.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a massive change,‚Äù said Godfrey. ‚ÄúIt basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it‚Äôs asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a terrible choice, and it‚Äôs really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.‚Äù

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. ‚ÄúThe government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.‚Äù

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. ‚ÄúThe government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,‚Äù Godfrey said.

‚ÄúWe just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we‚Äôre not talking about a never-ending stream of people ‚Äì it‚Äôs a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It‚Äôs just nonsense.‚Äù

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. ‚ÄúBoris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home ‚Äì and if we don‚Äôt move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It‚Äôs hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.‚Äù

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship ‚Äì but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

‚ÄúIf we wanted to move back we‚Äôd have to go through so many hoops now,‚Äù Woodford said, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not sure we‚Äôd meet the minimum income. It‚Äôs seems unfathomable to me ‚Ä¶ Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.‚Äù

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband ‚Äúcould not possibly decide by March 2022‚Äù whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

‚ÄúBut how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years ‚Äì she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that‚Äôs been taken away.‚Äù

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

‚ÄúBrexit means I can‚Äôt do that now, because I don‚Äôt yet have a full residence permit, so I can‚Äôt leave Greece for more than three months,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThen we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that‚Äôs not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.‚Äù

The couple would be ‚Äúvery unlikely‚Äù to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. ‚ÄúIt just seems so sad,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo many people‚Äôs choices taken away ‚Äì all those things my generation could do ‚Ä¶ And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.‚Äù

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

‚ÄúDaniel may want to come back ‚Äì not yet, certainly, but at some stage,‚Äù Barbara said. ‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn‚Äôt look very fair or equal to me.‚Äù

989,"'If the EU says we can‚Äôt open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni‚Äôs grandmother Adelina began the family‚Äôs ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

‚ÄúI have never not known a ski season,‚Äù said Di Bendinoni. ‚ÄúEven the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.‚Äù

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria‚Äôs finance minister, Gernot Bl√ºmel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy ‚Ç¨2bn (¬£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

‚ÄúIn Italy we‚Äôre in limbo, when you don‚Äôt know what will happen from one day to the next,‚Äù said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni‚Äôs cousin and a ski instructor. ‚ÄúThe way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians ‚Äì if the EU says we can‚Äôt open, then they should pay for it.‚Äù

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy‚Äôs third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d‚ÄôOulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgen√®vre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about ‚Ç¨11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere‚Äôs inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

‚ÄúSome got ‚Ç¨600, others ‚Ç¨1,200,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don‚Äôt discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn‚Äôt carry on. We‚Äôre at that level and politicians need to understand.‚Äù

Gianni Poncet, the village‚Äôs mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,‚Äù Poncet said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants ‚Äì across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn‚Äôt begin we will lose ‚Ç¨1bn.‚Äù

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular apr√®s-ski spot, said: ‚ÄúThere is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.‚Äù

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country‚Äôs total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

‚ÄúEven if people from abroad can‚Äôt come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,‚Äù Giovanni Brasso said. ‚ÄúIn the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.‚Äù

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves ‚Ä¶ and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

'We expected to go back in days': Karabakh truce means exile for some, homecoming for others

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan‚Äôs parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan‚Äôs soldiers reached the settlement‚Äôs outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

‚ÄúWe expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,‚Äù Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. ‚ÄúNobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,‚Äù Safaryan says.

Nagorno-Karabakh: Azerbaijan troops begin retaking land from Armenia Read more

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

‚ÄúWhen we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúEven after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be back soon.‚Äô It never happened.‚Äù

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a ‚Äúwar generation‚Äù: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

‚ÄúI was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,‚Äù she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. ‚ÄúGeographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.‚Äù

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. ‚ÄúArmenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúWe had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn‚Äôt trustful coexistence.‚Äù

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. ‚ÄúI asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúLater we learned it was about unification with Armenia.‚Äù

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. ‚ÄúWe said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,‚Äù Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúWe even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.‚Äù

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. ‚ÄúSlowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúOne day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,‚Äù Hajiyeva recalls. ‚ÄúAfter that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.‚Äù

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. ‚ÄúI opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,‚Äù she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family‚Äôs home. ‚ÄúMy parents just woke up and realised war had begun.‚Äù

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. ‚ÄúSome days they couldn‚Äôt even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,‚Äù Safaryan says. ‚ÄúThey were very bad, very harsh days.‚Äù

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan‚Äôs favour.

‚ÄúThe whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,‚Äù she claims. ‚ÄúThey left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.‚Äù

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh‚Äôs Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan‚Äôs parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. ‚ÄúThey are just existing,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWe are trying to figure out what we are going to do.‚Äù

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. ‚ÄúSome people were saying, why have you left your city?‚Äù she recalls. ‚ÄúThey were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.‚Äù

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. ‚ÄúThe house has survived the occupation,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what‚Äôs happening in my city.‚Äù

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. ‚ÄúMy friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve always prepared myself that once I‚Äôll be back in Shusha, I‚Äôll start my new life from zero.‚Äù

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. ‚ÄúI cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,‚Äù Hajizada said. ‚ÄúIt is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.‚Äù

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm nobody now,‚Äù Safaryan says.

‚ÄúEverything I was living and fighting for ‚Äì making plans for big projects in Hadrut and every village and city in Artsakh ‚Äì and now there‚Äôs nothing. Nothing to fight for, and nothing to live for.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
991,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel‚Äôs parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday‚Äôs vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu‚Äôs coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz‚Äôs Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday‚Äôs bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country‚Äôs longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

‚ÄúNetanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,‚Äù Gantz said. ‚ÄúShow me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country‚Äôs budget.‚Äù

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: ‚ÄúNetanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.‚Äù

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. ‚ÄúNow is not the time for elections,‚Äù Netanyahu said. ‚ÄúNow is the time for unity.‚Äù

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu‚Äôs ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

‚ÄúI was well aware of his track record as a ‚Äòserial promise-breaker‚Äô, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn‚Äôt happen,‚Äù Gantz said on Tuesday.

‚ÄúNetanyahu didn‚Äôt lie to me ‚Äì he lied to all of you.‚Äù

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

‚ÄúNetanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,‚Äù Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

‚Äú[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,‚Äù wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

‚ÄúThe prime minister‚Äôs ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using ‚Äúsnappy‚Äù slogans like ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

‚ÄúYou lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you‚Äôre actually going to get the changes you want done,‚Äù the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

‚ÄúThe key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?‚Äù Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important ‚Äúnew blood‚Äù in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ‚Äì who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president‚Äôs interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge ‚Äì ultimately unsuccessfully ‚Äì the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell‚Äôs seat in the November election.

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that ‚ÄúDefund the Police‚Äù was ‚Äúnot a slogan. It‚Äôs a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith all due respect, Mr President ‚Äì let‚Äôs talk about losing people,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We‚Äôre losing our loved ones to police violence.‚Äù

The Black Lives Matter movement member‚Äôs rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police ‚Äì a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health ‚Äì factors that contribute to crime.

The former president‚Äôs comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

Jamaal Bowman (@JamaalBowmanNY) Damn, Mr. President.



Didn‚Äôt you say ‚ÄúTrayvon could‚Äôve been my son?‚Äù



In 2014, #BlackLivesMatter was too much.



In 2016, Kaepernick was too much.



Today, discussing police budgets is too much.

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden‚Äôs flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

‚ÄúIf you instead say ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs reform the police department so that everybody‚Äôs being treated fairly,‚Äô‚Äù Clyburn offered alternatively. ‚ÄúNot just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?‚Äô‚Äù

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

‚ÄúShe speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don‚Äôt agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,‚Äù he said, adding that across political ideologies ‚Äúnew blood is always good‚Äù for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
993,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, ‚Äúproductivity score‚Äù, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators ‚Äúhelp their people get the most‚Äù from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

‚ÄúAt Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,‚Äù Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe also believe that privacy is a human right, and we‚Äôre deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.‚Äù

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren‚Äôt contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. ‚ÄúGoing forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level ‚Äì providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,‚Äù Spataro says. ‚ÄúNo one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.‚Äù

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. ‚ÄúProductivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,‚Äù Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company‚Äôs ‚Äúmodern workforce transformation‚Äù unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

‚ÄúThe thing I love most about Microsoft is that when we screw up, we acknowledge the error and fix it,‚Äù Snover tweeted. ‚Äú10,000 thanks to Wolfie Christl and others for the feedback which led to this change!‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
994,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don‚Äôt count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor‚Äôs note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board ‚Äúeroded the public trust in legitimate service animals‚Äù.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people ‚Äúfraudulently representing their pets as service animals‚Äù, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog‚Äôs health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can‚Äôt bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned ‚Äúpit bull type dogs‚Äù in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, ‚ÄúAt this time, there are no changes to Delta‚Äôs current service and support animal policies.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Read more

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

‚ÄúThere are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.‚Äù

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 ‚Äì from 80,000 to 500,000 every year ‚Äì when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

‚ÄúBut it is malaria that can explode the fastest ‚Äì it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‚Äòcanary in the coalmine‚Äô that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.‚Äù

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia‚Äôs interest.

And a similar proportion ‚Äì 56% ‚Äì believe that if Australia doesn‚Äôt support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

‚ÄúThe Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

‚ÄúAs a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.‚Äù

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

‚ÄúAustralians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours ‚Ä¶ indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.‚Äù

Australia's Covid vaccines: everything you need to know Read more

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia ‚Äúshould these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs‚Äù.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia‚Äôs vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should ‚Äúexplicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia‚Äù.

996,Oligarch's son flees to Russia as mother sues over 'hidden' divorce millions,[],"The son of a billionaire Russian oligarch who is being sued by his mother over claims he helped hide hundreds of millions of pounds due to her in the UK‚Äôs biggest ever divorce settlement has fled to Russia.

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad‚Äôs ‚Äúlieutenant‚Äù in a scheme to hide up to ¬£453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a ¬£30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was ‚Äústressed and scared‚Äù about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister‚Äôs home in Russia.

‚ÄúI got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams ‚Ä¶ harassing me. I‚Äôm drinking a lot,‚Äù he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying I was on the streets ‚Ä¶ [But] I‚Äôm not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].‚Äù He added that he was ‚Äúnot hiding‚Äù in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings ‚Äúway in excess‚Äù of the ¬£3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that ¬£3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter‚Äôs mother had become accustomed. ‚ÄúNow maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it‚Äôs different,‚Äù he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her ¬£453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the ¬£30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son‚Äôs emails.

Akhmedova‚Äôs legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband‚Äôs ¬£300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club‚Äôs owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

997,"Strictly dropped us after we asked to be paid, say musicians",[],"A group of professional musicians have said they were dropped by Strictly Come Dancing after they asked to be paid for performing on the programme‚Äôs spinoff show.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day‚Äôs work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: ‚ÄúWe just don‚Äôt have money in the budget to pay for contributors.‚Äù Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a ‚Äúdecent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name‚Äù, which would help boost the band‚Äôs following on Instagram and Facebook.

‚ÄúHopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,‚Äù they were told by the show‚Äôs producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians‚Äô Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: ‚ÄúThe days of ‚Äòit‚Äôll give you exposure‚Äô (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won‚Äôt get any gigs these days and we won‚Äôt sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production ‚Ä¶ They want us and our expertise, but they won‚Äôt pay for it.‚Äù

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: ‚ÄúLike all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven‚Äôt raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven‚Äôt monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

‚ÄúWe do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than ¬£20,000 a year, is a pittance.‚Äù

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly‚Äôs hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: ‚ÄúExternally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.‚Äù

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: ‚ÄúAs we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn‚Äôt happen for editorial reasons.‚Äù

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: ‚ÄúHad they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
998,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste‚Äôs fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world‚Äôs poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia‚Äôs treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share ¬£12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm honoured and privileged and I‚Äôm going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.‚Äù

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery‚Äôs story as ‚Äúextraordinary‚Äù.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOne of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

‚ÄúToday the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

‚ÄúHowever, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

‚ÄúBernard Collaery‚Äôs story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers‚Äô lawyers are now being targeted.‚Äù

Collaery and Witness K‚Äôs cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

The council warned that the laws were protecting ‚Äúbroadly defined national security at the expense of the rights of the accused‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to ¬£3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at ¬£3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a ¬£770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a ¬£3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

Shares in G4S rose 7.5% to 246p on Wednesday .

‚ÄúG4S needs an owner-operator that understands the people-orientated nature of the sector with the resources, time and expertise to solve the many challenges faced by the business.‚Äù

G4S investors now have until 16 December to decide whether they want to accept GardaWorld‚Äôs final offer.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as ‚Äúamazing‚Äù, ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù and beautiful,‚Äù but others were less impressed.

While the film‚Äôs message clearly riled members of Japan‚Äôs online right ‚Äì many of whom commented using pseudonyms ‚Äì more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

‚ÄúIs Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you‚Äôre creating a false impression of Japan,‚Äù said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: ‚ÄúNowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that‚Äôs prejudiced is Nike.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs it so much fun to blame Japan?‚Äù another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country‚Äôs multiracial rugby team at last year‚Äôs world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn‚Äôt Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the ‚Äúzainichi problem‚Äù ‚Äì a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are ‚Äústaying in Japan‚Äù.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world‚Äôs highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka‚Äôs sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she ‚Äúlooked sunburned‚Äù and ‚Äúneeded some bleach‚Äù.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

1001,World is ‚Äòdoubling down‚Äô on fossil fuels despite climate crisis ‚Äì UN report,[],"The world‚Äôs governments are ‚Äúdoubling down‚Äù on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid ‚Äúsevere climate disruption‚Äù. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

‚ÄúThe pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,‚Äù said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

‚ÄúAlas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death ‚Äì it‚Äôs kind of zombie energy.‚Äù

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: ‚ÄúWith governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year‚Äôs devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,‚Äù said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (¬£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world‚Äôs fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we‚Äôre beginning to see that happen,‚Äù said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: ‚ÄúWorking together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.‚Äù

1002,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‚Äòone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äô and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called ‚Äúone of the greatest challenges of our time‚Äù.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised ‚Äúthe devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire‚Äù.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the ‚Äúalarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity‚Äù including the decline in New Zealand‚Äôs indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and MƒÅori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must ‚Äúact with urgency‚Äù.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

‚ÄúThis declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúIt is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.‚Äù

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service‚Äôs buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the ‚Äúsignificant progress on meeting the challenge‚Äù by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation ‚Äì which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 ‚Äì made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was ‚Äúembarrassing‚Äù and had become ‚Äúuntenable‚Äù, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. ‚ÄúThe irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.‚Äù

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: ‚Äú[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.‚Äù

Wednesday‚Äôs declaration also said the government will ‚Äúdemonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government‚Äôs own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025‚Äù.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it ‚Äúvirtue signalling‚Äù.

‚ÄúWe think it‚Äôs all very well to declare an emergency but there‚Äôs no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,‚Äù Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government‚Äôs fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation‚Äôs biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand‚Äôs pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1003,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world‚Äôs coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world‚Äôs biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries ‚Äì Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal ‚Äì will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction ‚Äì known as exclusive economic zones ‚Äì are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: ‚ÄúHumanity‚Äôs wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.‚Äù

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: ‚ÄúAustralians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods ‚Ä¶ When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.‚Äù

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world‚Äôs oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was ‚Äúa really big deal‚Äù and could restore the health of the world‚Äôs oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

‚ÄúWhat you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it‚Äôs not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant ‚Äì business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe oceans are in a very sorry state right now.‚Äù

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. ‚ÄúWe are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.‚Äù

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: ‚ÄúIf we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.‚Äù

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world‚Äôs oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of ‚Äúghost‚Äù fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a ‚Äúcircular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of ‚Äúdead zones‚Äù from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik √ñsterblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: ‚Äú[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.‚Äù

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world‚Äôs oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: ‚ÄúThe UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1004,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing ‚Äì a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other‚Äôs perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls ‚Äì meaning that they push their joypad‚Äôs thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen ‚Äì the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

‚ÄúAlthough it‚Äôs not per se a topic we‚Äôd study in our lab, we‚Äôd had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,‚Äù explains Corbett. ‚ÄúThis was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.‚Äù

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? ‚ÄúGenerally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúThere are no right or wrong answers in these tasks ‚Äì we‚Äôre interested in how people might perform differently. We‚Äôll obtain one or two measures ‚Äì for example, average reaction time, average accuracy ‚Äì from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.‚Äù

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual‚Äôs visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. ‚ÄúFor example,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.‚Äù

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. ‚ÄúUnderstanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúMost research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can‚Äôt really process more than a few details at once. There‚Äôs a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.‚Äù

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what‚Äôs on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

‚ÄúSuch findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‚Äòreal‚Äô flight consoles,‚Äù says Corbett. ‚ÄúIn a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.‚Äù

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

‚Ä¢ Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

1005,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace ‚Äì review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain ‚Äì and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens ‚Äì all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don‚Äôt ‚Äì because, obviously, they weren‚Äôt allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen‚Äôs pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art ‚Äì and this collection ‚Äì to HM using the term ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù. This old school art snob would no more have said ‚Äúearly modern‚Äù than he‚Äôd have said ‚Äútaken to Twitter‚Äù. He‚Äôd have said ‚Äúrenaissance‚Äù or ‚Äúbaroque‚Äù.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen‚Äôs Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection‚Äôs finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I‚Äôve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt‚Äôs rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam‚Äôs Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar‚Äôs anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he‚Äôs studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They‚Äôre consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing ‚Ä¶ Rembrandt‚Äôs Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / ¬© Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I‚Äôll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It‚Äôs hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here‚Äôs the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He‚Äôd recently lost his wife. A friend ‚Äì thought to be William, Lord Crofts ‚Äì is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck‚Äôs mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer‚Äôs surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they‚Äôre in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It‚Äôs either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens‚Äôs personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There‚Äôs a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi‚Äôs Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show ‚Äì she painted it for Charles I ‚Äì and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection‚Äôs virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I‚Äôm grateful that some of the royal family‚Äôs treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It‚Äôs hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

I‚Äôm an Australian comedian who normally lives in London, but I‚Äôve ended up unexpectedly trapped in New Zealand this year on my way back to Australia. Well, as much as you can be trapped in one of the safest places in the world.

I‚Äôve spent most of 2020 walking around in the woods alone in the day, and scrolling through the internet to check the rest of the world is still there at night. It‚Äôs been nice but I am probably getting a bit of a Jack Torrance vibe.

London and New Zealand are great, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I haven‚Äôt been home to Australia in years and by now I‚Äôm homesick enough that I‚Äôd probably fall to my knees at the mere waft of a sausage.

1) This sketch from Mad as Hell that I wish was for a real show

‚ÄòThis country is facing an existential crisis.‚Äô

Writing on Mad As Hell was one of the best jobs I‚Äôve ever gotten to do and I miss working with the team and cast. I‚Äôve really loved watching how they tackled 2020 restrictions and I‚Äôm extremely glad that they were allowed to keep producing the show this year. This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‚ÄòI will just warn you before I go any further ...‚Äô

As a comic it‚Äôs hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She‚Äôs just so good.

4) Steve Irwin being bitten by a snake three seconds after he says it won‚Äôt bite

‚ÄòThe only reason I‚Äôm doing this is because this one‚Äôs a python ...‚Äô

1007,Godmothered review ‚Äì Disney remixes Enchanted ‚Ä¶ minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones‚Äôs Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There‚Äôs the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles ‚Äì swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

It‚Äôs impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney‚Äôs 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor‚Äôs career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland‚Äôs closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams‚Äôs Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there‚Äôs winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom ‚Äì Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor‚Äôs preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor‚Äôs self-centered ‚Äúhelpfulness‚Äù feels earned. But Godmothered‚Äôs tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother‚Äôs overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there‚Äôs one ‚Äì co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) ‚Äì within reach), but its shoehorned revelation ‚Äì that true loves comes in many forms ‚Äì is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious ‚Äì unrealistic in the parts where it‚Äôs trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor‚Äôs misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it‚Äôs a bumpy, underwhelming ride ‚Äì not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1008,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world ‚Äì it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‚ÄòLast night,‚Äù says Laima Leyton, ‚ÄúI went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramoviƒá. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn‚Äôt have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.‚Äù

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists ‚Äì Leyton among them ‚Äì about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly‚Äôs condemnation of petty domesticity ‚Äì ‚ÄúThere is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall‚Äù ‚Äì and Tracey Emin‚Äôs oft-quoted line: ‚ÄúThere are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.‚Äù

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,‚Äù painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer‚Äôs wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report‚Äôs data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that‚Äôs not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected ‚Äúblind‚Äù. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists‚Äô careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn‚Äôt factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world ‚Äì motherhood. My resulting essay ‚Äì Full, Messy and Beautiful ‚Äì was published alongside this year‚Äôs report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

‚ÄúMy experience,‚Äù Anna Perach told me, ‚Äúis that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‚Äòsold out‚Äô or joined the bourgeoisie. It‚Äôs often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.‚Äù

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with ‚Äúthe holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids‚Äù, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can‚Äôt be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn‚Äôt come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn‚Äôt have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? ‚ÄúPaying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,‚Äù said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There‚Äôs now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities ‚Äì buzz, aura, image ‚Äì there is quite simply a problem of perception. ‚ÄúWomen artists are marginalised generally,‚Äù as Jemima Burrill put it. ‚ÄúMothers are almost beyond the pale.‚Äù

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are ‚Äì and have been ‚Äì great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that ‚Äústicky thought‚Äù that a woman cannot excel as both.

1009,"Faith review ‚Äì compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains ‚Äúwarrior monks‚Äù in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks‚Äô daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white ‚Äì it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn‚Äôt help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there‚Äôs no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions ‚Äì five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken ‚Äì to fuel his narcissism and ego, I‚Äôd say. It‚Äôs deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I‚Äôd like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

1010,‚ÄòAs consumers we all have tremendous impact‚Äô: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we‚Äôre on if we‚Äôre to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you‚Äôre a climate science denier, you‚Äôll be familiar with ‚Äì and anxious to see something done about ‚Äì a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive ‚Äì going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere ‚Äì the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it‚Äôs from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The ‚Äúnatural carbon storage‚Äù of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft‚Äôs target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it‚Äôs a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs a mindset,‚Äù says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. ‚ÄúWe decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We‚Äôre embracing the challenge.‚Äù

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations ‚Äì ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it‚Äôs the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion‚Äôs share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‚ÄòWe can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,‚Äô says Henkel‚Äôs Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company‚Äôs direct influence presents challenges. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúTake our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can‚Äôt force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can‚Äôt make you switch your energy supplier. But it‚Äôs in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.‚Äù

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel‚Äôs global carbon footprint ‚Äì just 2% compared with Ikea‚Äôs 11%, for example ‚Äì the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. ‚ÄúOnce we‚Äôve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.‚Äù

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites ‚Äì both thermal and photovoltaic ‚Äì any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company‚Äôs plans.

‚ÄúIf we have the right energy infrastructure in place ‚Äì similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montorn√®s del Vall√®s in Spain, for example ‚Äì we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,‚Äù says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory ‚Äì so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Modern concentrated detergents require far less to be used, thus saving bulk and raw materials. Photograph: RoBeDeRo/Getty Images

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. ‚ÄúWhen I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúToday, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It‚Äôs quite a dramatic progress.‚Äù Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: ‚ÄúThe classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it‚Äôs too easy to do right now.‚Äù Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. ‚ÄúThe capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,‚Äù Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. ‚ÄúWe have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,‚Äù says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: ‚ÄúOur products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers ‚Äì and ultimately consumers ‚Äì save energy and carbon.‚Äù

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you‚Äôll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. ‚ÄúYou, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,‚Äù says Bergmann. ‚ÄúDo I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?‚Äù

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. ‚ÄúVideo-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,‚Äù says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. ‚ÄúLaundry won‚Äôt complain if you wash it cold, so that‚Äôs easier. Your clothes will last longer and your electricity bill will be lower,‚Äù says Bergmann, adding that decades of research has enabled Henkel to produce detergents that function at these lower temperatures. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about generating a good value proposition ‚Äì the behavioural change will follow.‚Äù

For all the company‚Äôs good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat. The first step to combating this is having a clear breakdown of our own carbon footprints. ‚ÄúThis transparency enables us to make informed choices,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe all need to take gradual steps, rather than just seeing an overwhelming target that we‚Äôll struggle to achieve.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1011,‚ÄòThe holy grail of packaging recycling‚Äô: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there‚Äôs one thing the British public likes to complain about, it‚Äôs recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn‚Äôt, where it ends up and who‚Äôs paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn‚Äôt always straightforward. ‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really hard to identify what kind of material it is,‚Äù says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. ‚ÄúIf the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it‚Äôs covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,‚Äù he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it‚Äôs vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies ‚Äì essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‚ÄòThe objective is to increase farmer incomes‚Äô: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer‚Äôs bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. ‚ÄúThis means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,‚Äù says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it‚Äôs a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. ‚ÄúIt makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today‚Äôs problems in sorting and recycling packaging,‚Äù says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. ‚Äú[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.‚Äù

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product‚Äôs website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. ‚ÄúMaybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],‚Äù he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. ‚ÄúWe are in a very early pioneering phase,‚Äù he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. ‚ÄúEven with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.‚Äù

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold‚Äôs mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. ‚ÄúIt brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,‚Äù he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. ‚ÄúThis means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.‚Äù

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. ‚ÄúOne of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it‚Äôs time to take this testing to the next level.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn‚Äôt something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. ‚ÄúI think it was my children,‚Äù he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. ‚ÄúAs they‚Äôve gotten older, they‚Äôve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.‚Äù

In the salon‚Äôs new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There‚Äôs a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He‚Äôs also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he‚Äôs already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there‚Äôs been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs added a real buzz to the salon,‚Äù he says. ‚Äú[Clients] feel they‚Äôre doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what‚Äôs going on [in the world].‚Äù

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. ‚ÄúA big turning point was David Attenborough‚Äôs The Blue Planet,‚Äù she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. ‚ÄúI had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‚ÄòOur customers want us to go green.‚Äô‚Äù

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than ¬£5,000 a year. ‚ÄúThere are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we‚Äôve found a lot of win-wins,‚Äù Baden says. ‚Äú[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients‚Äô behaviour. They‚Äôre connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.‚Äù

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai G√∂rlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel‚Äôs brands. ‚ÄúWe truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,‚Äù he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, G√∂rlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf‚Äôs Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children‚Äôs Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. ‚ÄúHairdressing is a skill, a craft ‚Äì it‚Äôs teachable,‚Äù Ellis says. ‚ÄúSo we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.‚Äù Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. ‚ÄúShe ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve changed my life.‚Äô It‚Äôs wonderful.‚Äù

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. ‚ÄúI felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.‚Äù Many will go on to set up their own businesses ‚Äì Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‚ÄúHe said that it‚Äôs such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,‚Äù G√∂rlitz says of Son. ‚ÄúIn 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.‚Äù And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, G√∂rlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel‚Äôs Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. ‚ÄúShaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.‚Äù

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he‚Äôs felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. ‚ÄúFor the first time ever, we‚Äôve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That‚Äôs incredible. There‚Äôs been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1013,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue ‚Äì its stickiness ‚Äì is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 ‚Äì the 2020 target is 60% ‚Äì it‚Äôs vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind‚Äôs environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: ‚ÄúThe issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.‚Äù

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It‚Äôs things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes ‚Äì generally, anything that doesn‚Äôt spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. ‚ÄúIt costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn‚Äôt collect and sort it,‚Äù he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex‚Äôs goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK‚Äôs circular economy package ‚Äì an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value ‚Äì will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It‚Äôs all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we‚Äôll see a change for flexible packaging then. ‚ÄúWhen the EPR system is launched in 2023, we‚Äôre hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,‚Äù he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won‚Äôt be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. ‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôre doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time ‚Äì let‚Äôs say cardboard ‚Äì and also for plastics,‚Äù says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel‚Äôs projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. ‚ÄúI said to him: ‚ÄòWhy can‚Äôt you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?‚Äô He said he‚Äôd worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!‚Äù

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer ‚Äì often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec‚Äôs technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. ‚ÄúThe debonding allows you to recover more [materials],‚Äù Bankmann says. ‚ÄúIt will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.‚Äù

The adhesives developed with Saperatec‚Äôs recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel‚Äôs RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. ‚ÄúAs the targets go up and we‚Äôre increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,‚Äù he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1014,17 delicious loaf tin recipes (that aren‚Äôt banana bread),[],"A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost ¬£2 ‚Äì even the cheapest model will set you back about ¬£2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough ‚Äì about 900g.

So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity ‚Äì any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin ‚Äì some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner‚Äôs lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin ‚Äì and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.

A good place to start is plain old bread ‚Äì specifically, Dan Lepard‚Äôs sour cream sandwich loaf. While it is possible to knock up endless free-form, rustic loaves at home, the point of the tin is to make bread that in some way resembles the stuff you buy in a shop: sharp-cornered, sandwich friendly, toaster ready. Lepard‚Äôs method relies on a quick knead ‚Äì about 10 seconds ‚Äì repeated at 10 minute intervals, plus a final rise in the tin. In this, and in every recipe here, you would be wise first to line your tin with greaseproof paper, even if the loaf tin in question is non-stick. If you like living dangerously, feel free to ignore this warning and accept the consequences.

Claire Thomson‚Äôs porridge bread makes good use of leftover cold porridge, mixed in with the white flour. For a darker, gluten-free bread, Lepard offers multiseed and molasses bread. Besides molasses (or black treacle), the recipe requires a mix of potato starch, cornflour, rice flour, psyllium husk, egg white and a selection of seeds. But because there is no gluten, there is no need to knead: you end up with a sort of batter that firms itself up as it rises.

Loaf tins are not just for bread ‚Äì you can also use them to make loaf-shaped cakes, a pound cake being one of the best and simplest. Traditionally, pound cake contained a pound of each of the four main ingredients (flour, butter, sugar and eggs), but you don‚Äôt need a maths degree to realise that this would overwhelm a 2lb tin. Instead, try this recipe for vanilla pound cake, which calls for 200g of each (that means three eggs), along with a teaspoon of untraditional, but wholly welcome, baking powder.

Drizzle cake is another loaf tin standard. Felicity Cloake‚Äôs perfect version is a close relative to pound cake, with some ground almonds and lemon zest thrown in and, of course, the drizzle. Fergus Henderson‚Äôs seed cake, meanwhile, is one of the few dedicated elevenses recipes out there, best administered with a glass of something while lunch is still a distant prospect. The seed in question is caraway; the something should be madeira.

Rachel Roddy‚Äôs marmalade cake is yet another variation ‚Äì the proportions are the same as for pound cake, although the amounts here suggest a 1lb loaf tin may be a more suitable size. Tamal Ray‚Äôs blood orange syrup loaf is a gluten-free option, using polenta instead of flour. In an emergency, you could profitably employ regular oranges.

Ruby Tandoh‚Äôs blueberry loaf cake is made with yoghurt and almond oil (although she says sunflower oil, with a little added vanilla, works as a substitute). Delia Smith has a recipe for dark Jamaican gingerbread that will allow you to get more use out of that tin of black treacle or molasses you bought to make Lepard‚Äôs bread.

Your loaf tin can also serve as a mould for savoury dishes, most famously meatloaf. There are countless wildly different variations on this classic American dish and I have hit on a few bad ones while trying to recreate the kind my mother made. As ever, it is wisest to rely on Cloake‚Äôs definitive version: after some experimentation, she settles on a recipe containing, among other things, spinach, yoghurt, eggs, garlic, brown sugar and ketchup. If you are looking for something elementary ‚Äì and very much in the humble, no-nonsense spirit of the dish ‚Äì you could have a go at this five-ingredient meatloaf: mince, bacon, sage-and-onion stuffing mix, a beef stock cube and sunflower oil. If you don‚Äôt like the sound of that list, don‚Äôt be surprised if you don‚Äôt like meatloaf.

As far as I am concerned, a terrine tin and a loaf tin are the same thing ‚Äì if you have one, you have both. This means that as soon as you have turned out your bread you can use the tin to whip up a pat√© de campagne. Once again, I am passing on Cloake‚Äôs hard-won expertise, alongside a warning that this will amount to rather more than a lazy afternoon‚Äôs work. Plus, you may have to source some caul fat. Another option is this festive-sounding duck and pork terrine with cranberries and pistachios, which has the advantage of being rather easier to pull together.

A terrine need not be a savoury dish ‚Äì your loaf tin can give shape to all sorts of desserts and puddings. This coffee ice-cream terrine, for example, is made up of layers of coffee and vanilla ice-cream, cemented together with chocolate sauce and left to set hard in the freezer.

Chocolate caramel terrine is another layered pudding ‚Äì this time a caramel, mascarpone, chocolate and cream mixture interspersed with caramel wafers cut to fit your loaf tin. More impressive still is Liam Charles‚Äôs rhubarb and honey panna cotta terrine: a blondie biscuit base with rhubarb jelly on top and panna cotta in between. If you feel uncomfortable making something like that in the same loaf tin you used for meatloaf last week, then I am with you. Best to buy another one for desserts ‚Äì you can get them for about ¬£2.50.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1015,How to make cullen skink ‚Äì recipe,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there‚Äôs anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it‚Äôs the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it‚Äôs too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked ‚Äì to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it‚Äôs not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool ‚Äì take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums ‚Ä¶

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 ‚Ä¶ and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don‚Äôt bother to peel them unless they‚Äôre very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice ‚Äì small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink ‚Äì white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury‚Ä¶

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns ‚Äì steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1016,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she‚Äôd taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. ‚ÄúAnd then the next morning, I just went: ‚ÄòNo, that‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm going out.‚Äô‚Äù She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,‚Äù she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself ‚Äì making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

‚ÄúI started to get those feelings last week,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a terrible uneasiness. There‚Äôs this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can‚Äôt concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there‚Äôs a feeling of complete hopelessness.‚Äù There are physical sensations, too ‚Äì her heart races, and she feels hot. ‚ÄúAnd just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.‚Äù Although it‚Äôs tough to experience, it is, she says, ‚Äúa godsend that I know what‚Äôs happening now‚Äù.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, ‚Äúthe usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out‚Äù. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious‚Äù.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we‚Äôre not around the people who might spot something is off ‚Äì our family, friends or colleagues ‚Äì and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

‚ÄòIf you are feeling very sad, you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment.‚Äô Photograph: LaylaBird/Getty Images

‚ÄúFor instance, if you are feeling very sad,‚Äù says Robinson, ‚Äúyou would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you‚Äôre not looking forward to anything in the future. That‚Äôs quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.‚Äù Instead, says Robinson, ‚Äúask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to‚Äù.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. ‚ÄúNormally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut everyone‚Äôs finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can‚Äôt concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?‚Äù

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we‚Äôre living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? ‚ÄúSo ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?‚Äù Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. ‚ÄúSo the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself ‚Äì and in a limited, more muted way than previously ‚Äì am I still able to motivate myself to see people?‚Äù

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. ‚ÄúAgain, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that‚Äôs a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,‚Äù says Robinson. ‚ÄúBut if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can‚Äôt get things done that need to get done, you can‚Äôt get the shopping in, you can‚Äôt bring yourself to eat or you‚Äôre overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can‚Äôt function, these would be warning signs to seek help.‚Äù

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you‚Äôre being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and ‚Äúwhether people find that they‚Äôre excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That‚Äôs a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.‚Äù

‚ÄòAsk yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to.‚Äô Photograph: Christopher Hopefitch/Getty Images

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there‚Äôs a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.‚Äù

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about ‚Äúthriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there‚Äôs that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There‚Äôs more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there‚Äôs an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.‚Äù

The core symptoms of depression, he says, ‚Äúare a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn‚Äôt necessarily indicate that there‚Äôs definitely a mental health condition.‚Äù It‚Äôs when it becomes pervasive and has an ‚Äúimpact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we‚Äôre becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.‚Äù However, he points out, ‚Äúeverybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what‚Äôs normal for you?‚Äù

‚ÄòI found I wasn‚Äôt reading, and I thought: ‚ÄúThis is very odd.‚Äù‚Äô Photograph: Tara Moore/Getty Images (Posed by model)

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, ‚ÄúI found that suddenly I wasn‚Äôt reading and I thought: ‚ÄòThis is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?‚Äô I‚Äôd start and I couldn‚Äôt concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn‚Äôt even pick up a book.‚Äù A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt played the guitar since lockdown. It‚Äôs something that I really enjoy, but I can‚Äôt kind of get around to doing it.‚Äù During low periods, ‚ÄúI tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I‚Äôll find excuses why I can‚Äôt see them. So I know that I‚Äôve got to force myself to do something.‚Äù Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people ‚Äúand just be silly‚Äù, but obviously it hasn‚Äôt been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it‚Äôs not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise ‚Äì particularly walking ‚Äì works for her, ‚Äúand cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‚ÄòYou‚Äôve failed again, you‚Äôre going back to where you were.‚Äô It‚Äôs just like: ‚ÄòNo, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.‚Äô And it‚Äôs on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.‚Äù She would seek help, she says, ‚Äúif it got to the point that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to manage it myself‚Äù.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. ‚ÄúThe charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúYou should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.‚Äù There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. ‚ÄúI would emphasise that it‚Äôs been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,‚Äù says Obuaya. ‚ÄúTherefore we shouldn‚Äôt make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they‚Äôve got a major mental health problem.‚Äù But, he stresses, there is ‚Äúa range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.‚Äù

‚Ä¢ In the UK, the charity Mind is available on 0300 123 3393 and Childline on 0800 1111. In the US, Mental Health America is available on 800-273-8255. In Australia, support is available at Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636, Lifeline on 13 11 14, and at MensLine on 1300 789 978

1017,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you‚Äôve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling ‚Äúthe pandemic‚Äù, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It‚Äôs most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, ‚Äúlife‚Äù is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I‚Äôve been targeted with ads for ‚Äúface yoga‚Äù, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize ‚Äì $25

Who doesn‚Äôt want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 ‚Äúreps‚Äù a day for 30 days. The beginners‚Äô version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you‚Äôve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a ‚ÄúChad‚Äù ‚Äì a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix ‚Äì $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No ‚Äì she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night‚Äôs sleep.

At first I didn‚Äôt want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I‚Äôm asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don‚Äôt suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn‚Äôt stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn‚Äôt to say such strips can‚Äôt be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don‚Äôt think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.‚Äù Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it‚Äôs no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it‚Äôs probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good ‚Äì the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you‚Äôve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

‚ÄúMy first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it‚Äôs not too expensive, it‚Äôs very reasonable to try.‚Äù

So can they work? ‚ÄúIn terms of its actual efficacy it‚Äôs hard to say,‚Äù David says. ‚ÄúReally, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.‚Äù However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it‚Äôs ‚Äúworth a shot‚Äù.

Upright Go 2 ‚Äì $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you‚Äôve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They‚Äôre right, of course, but it‚Äôs also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you‚Äôve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can‚Äôt roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I‚Äôd recommend it the most.

Manly app ‚Äì $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic ‚Äì especially if you‚Äôre single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It‚Äôs simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly‚Äôs suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it‚Äôs been stuffed full of sausages.

Some screenshots of Manly app adverts from Instagram. Photograph: Manly, Photable

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they‚Äôve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look ‚Äúreal‚Äù because they are. Meanwhile the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I‚Äôm quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you‚Äôre one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre ‚Äì like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people‚Äôs body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we‚Äôre all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it‚Äôs editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it‚Äôs something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1018,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an ‚Äúexclusively English environment‚Äù.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: ‚ÄúAmongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting ‚Ä¶ and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‚Äòcultural habit‚Äô of visiting ‚Ä¶ There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.‚Äù

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show‚Äôs presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still ‚Äúwork to do‚Äù.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country ‚Äì regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland‚Äôs peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

‚ÄúI found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn‚Äôt know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit ‚Äì I imagine it was all three ‚Äì but it was tough,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained ‚Ä¶ but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.‚Äù

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

‚ÄúI realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I‚Äôd come back feeling refreshed ‚Äì ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.‚Äù

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

‚ÄúPeople look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it‚Äôs consistently pointed out to you that you don‚Äôt fit in, or when you don‚Äôt see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn‚Äôt be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.‚Äù

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

‚ÄúPosting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it‚Äôs not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.‚Äù

‚ÄúSome people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.‚Äù

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go ‚Äì her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and ‚Äúdoing something really physical‚Äù.

‚ÄúThese hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,‚Äù she said.

I‚Äôd been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

‚ÄúI needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn‚Äôt just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn‚Äôt doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.‚Äù

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

‚ÄúMany people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside ‚Äì the last bastions of whiteness ‚Äì where it is even less diverse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.‚Äù

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton ‚Äì one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

‚ÄúThere are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.‚Äù

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in ‚Äúgrubby holiday homes‚Äù, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come ‚Äúrain or shine‚Äù.

‚ÄúMy dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn‚Äôt and so it was kind of non-negotiable ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake ‚Äì we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúSometimes I didn‚Äôt even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.‚Äù

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

‚ÄúWith swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you‚Äôve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents ‚Äì all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

‚ÄúThere are so many good things about swimming outside: it‚Äôs so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1019,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a ‚Äúfriend with benefits‚Äù, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is ‚Äútrust‚Äù. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life ‚Äì finances, work, household, even grooming ‚Äì so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that ‚Äúagreement‚Äù would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would ‚Äì how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent ‚Äì including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established ‚Äúswingers‚Äù community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1021,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a ‚Äúfertility specialist‚Äù in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City‚Äôs first women‚Äôs hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband‚Äôs sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm‚Äôs daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff‚Äôs office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn‚Äôt heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada‚Äôs doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families ‚Äì 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor‚Äôs treatments ‚Äì shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, ‚Äúthe idea of closure is really impossible,‚Äù Hannah Olson, the film‚Äôs director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how ‚Äúpainful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence‚Äù.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records ‚Äì birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives ‚Äì sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora‚Äôs box of secrets. ‚ÄúAll of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn‚Äôt the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn‚Äôt the person they thought he was,‚Äù she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized ‚Äì ‚Äúthis was a phenomenon.‚Äù

Baby God initially follows Babst‚Äôs personal investigation, as she retraces her mother‚Äôs steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier‚Äôs former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality ‚Äì a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable ‚Äì has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier‚Äôs previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. ‚ÄúI feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn‚Äôt violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,‚Äù he says in the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still struggling with that. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôll end up.‚Äù

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. ‚ÄúAt first it was like ‚Äòlet‚Äôs get all the facts, we‚Äôre going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,‚Äô‚Äù said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction ‚Äì one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier ‚Äì make the doctor‚Äôs deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a ‚Äúdoctor knows best‚Äù attitude, belief that women don‚Äôt need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn‚Äôt become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, ‚Äúwe ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,‚Äù said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film‚Äôs second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier‚Äôs two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline‚Äôs descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case‚Äôs larger, more unsettling questions. ‚ÄúLooking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it‚Äôs always been illegal. It‚Äôs battery, it‚Äôs malpractice, you can‚Äôt put something in someone‚Äôs body without their consent,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.‚Äù

‚ÄúTowards the end, it became about making peace with one‚Äôs parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?‚Äù The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a ‚Äúvery bizarre case‚Äù to ‚Äúilluminate something that may be universal,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all just trying to make peace with our parents.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1022,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It‚Äôs the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It‚Äôs now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it‚Äôs honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It‚Äôs a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum‚Äôs executive director.

‚ÄúEven though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,‚Äù said Horsford. ‚ÄúIt can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.‚Äù

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. ‚ÄúThey think, oh we‚Äôre in the north, that wasn‚Äôt an issue here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFrom my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it‚Äôs a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.‚Äù

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. ‚ÄúPeople who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don‚Äôt say much more,‚Äù she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it‚Äôs a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

‚ÄúWe wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we‚Äôre talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,‚Äù adds Horsford. ‚ÄúWe never want to say: ‚Äòthese people were just slaves,‚Äô because there‚Äôs so much to the story than just that.‚Äù

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm‚Äôs former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

‚ÄúI wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today‚Äôs generations, are human,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.‚Äù

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

‚ÄúWe must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,‚Äù said Black. ‚ÄúNot just select people.‚Äù

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the ‚Äúfront parlor‚Äù, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information ‚Äúrelating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room‚Äù, said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúThese images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.‚Äù

Sydlowski‚Äôs work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, ‚Äúcreated specifically for those who were enslaved‚Äù, she said. ‚ÄúThe parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.‚Äù

It captures an ongoing battle. ‚ÄúNew York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,‚Äù said Sydlowski. ‚ÄúMy installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.‚Äù

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

‚ÄúHighlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,‚Äù said Prevost.

‚ÄúToday, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,‚Äù she adds.

‚ÄúFollowing our recent election, we‚Äôve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1023,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn‚Äôt know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry‚Äôs book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we‚Äôve diligently followed Barry‚Äôs class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute ‚Äúattendance card‚Äù, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I‚Äôve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

During the pandemic, many activities I love (eating out, visiting friends) are forbidden. I‚Äôm often too anxious to read for any length of time, and writing‚Äôs a challenge. With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn‚Äôt believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn‚Äôt bear to give away. It‚Äôs meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work ‚Äì writing, reporting, teaching ‚Äì I never worry if I‚Äôm doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we‚Äôve exhausted Lynda Barry‚Äôs attendance cards. Now we‚Äôve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity‚Äôs sake, and it‚Äôs surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that‚Äôs unpredictable ‚Äì will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? ‚Äì it feels good to let go of the ‚Äúperfect drawing‚Äù and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who‚Äôd burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I‚Äôd no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn‚Äôt quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I‚Äôm a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I‚Äôm floating in outer space, miles above Earth‚Äôs problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

1024,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' ‚Äì the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. ‚ÄúIt seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn‚Äôt believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?‚Äù says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee‚Äôs Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called ‚Äúblack vernacular art‚Äù. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston‚Äôs Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was ‚Äúgoing to change art history‚Äù. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with ‚Äúsongs of sorrow‚Äù from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion ‚Äì quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. ‚ÄúThat the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,‚Äù said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett‚Äôs son, Matt. ‚ÄúThe rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.‚Äù

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett ‚Äì like all the quilters ‚Äì was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt ‚Äì a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 ‚Äì now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters‚Äô work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee‚Äôs Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours ‚Äì typical of the period ‚Äì make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie‚Äôs daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a ‚Äúblock style‚Äù that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. ‚ÄúAs a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they‚Äôd let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,‚Äù she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, ‚Äúbut it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.‚Äù It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee‚Äôs Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw ‚Äì now director of Texas Southern University Museum ‚Äì captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created ‚Äúbetween picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband ‚Ä¶ [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.‚Äù

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts ‚Äì like Qunnie‚Äôs ‚ÄúHousetop‚Äù ‚Äì after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. ‚ÄúNormally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,‚Äù says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. ‚ÄúI do believe that the intentions were good, but I don‚Äôt think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,‚Äù she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee‚Äôs Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It‚Äôs not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren‚Äôt many quilters among the younger generations, she says ‚Äì at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, ‚Äúbut our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration‚Äù.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1025,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano‚Äôs 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier‚Äôs pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôd put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,‚Äù Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado‚Äôs Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

‚ÄúThis is some of the worst work in the world,‚Äù said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park‚Äôs rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement ‚Äì and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers‚Äô lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill‚Äôs toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel‚Äôs Landing in Utah‚Äôs Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

‚ÄúIf I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out ‚Ä¶ and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,‚Äù Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill‚Äôs toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren‚Äôt cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they‚Äôre not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag ‚Äì often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell ‚Äì or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah‚Äôs Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won‚Äôt degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

‚ÄúPeople are really opening up to the idea,‚Äù Henry said.

Plastic bags aren‚Äôt a perfect fix ‚Äì they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don‚Äôt want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don‚Äôt have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

‚ÄúOnce you get eight miles into the backcountry, it‚Äôs up to you to dig a hole,‚Äù Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1026,Cabaret's Joel Grey: 'Life is tough. But it's also beautiful',[],"‚ÄúShame on you! How could you bring that up? You wanna see a grown man cry?‚Äù Joel Grey is berating me on Zoom. All I wanted to know was how he got the nickname Mr Porno when filming his role as the Emcee, the smirking ringleader he created on Broadway in Kander and Ebb‚Äôs Weimar musical Cabaret. Mercifully, he is teasing me.

It‚Äôs not for the first time in our chat. There is a glint in his eye when he impersonates a ventriloquist‚Äôs dummy, breaks into a snippet of Sixteen Going on Seventeen from The Sound of Music (he once auditioned to play Rolf) and punctuates answers with a high-pitched exhalation that sounds like air escaping from a balloon. When he asks if I want to go to the Oscars I half-believe he‚Äôll take me. His party piece turns out to be an impression of Diana Ross, who handed him his statuette for best supporting actor for Cabaret at the Academy Awards in 1973. ‚ÄúListen to this,‚Äù he says, coming closer to the screen. ‚ÄúAnd the Oscar goes to,‚Äù he half-whispers in a breathy, suspenseful sigh. ‚ÄúJoel ‚Ä¶ Grey!‚Äù

Grey is 88 going on 18. In a pale pink shirt and clear frame glasses, he pops up not with the Emcee‚Äôs willkommen or bienvenue but a perky ‚ÄúHiya! How are ya?‚Äù He is in the office of his New York loft apartment, overlooking Hudson River park. The Oscar can be glimpsed in profile on the windowsill, alongside a Tony award for Cabaret. I‚Äôve already taken a virtual tour of his loft ‚Äì where his own photographs hang among artworks by Robert Rauschenberg and Duane Michals ‚Äì as it was featured in an interior design video online. I compliment him on his airy bathroom where a giant photograph of Machu Picchu hangs next to a monolithic tub. ‚ÄúWell we‚Äôre not going in there today,‚Äù he replies briskly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good place for an interview.‚Äù

He has spent the morning making french toast and compiling a personal scrapbook of old pictures. It may be the next in his series of photography books, which have included a volume of vibrant closeup portraits of flowers. One of his lockdown hobbies is buying blooms at a nearby shop, then spending hours ‚Äúpulling them apart and looking deep inside‚Äù. He disappears to fetch a large print of purple petals and holds it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a face,‚Äù he says from behind the photograph. ‚ÄúA scary, beautiful thing.‚Äù It‚Äôs true: the flower resembles a glowing skull, somehow both richly flamboyant and ethereal. The picture remains held up, filling the screen. There is a silence. Do I talk to the flower? ‚ÄúGo ahead,‚Äù Grey chuckles from behind it.

With Broadway‚Äôs theatres closed by the pandemic, what has Grey been doing for entertainment? ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been looking at TikTok,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that? Everybody is doing it. My grandchild is doing it. And I don‚Äôt know what it is!‚Äù Has he been going out much? ‚ÄúLess and less. I live across the street from the river and there‚Äôs a beautiful park. When we go there, it‚Äôs jammed with people ‚Äì with masks mostly, but I get nervous.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a lot to fit into Grey‚Äôs scrapbook. He has been acting for almost 80 years. His professional debut, aged nine, was in his home town of Cleveland in On Borrowed Time, a macabre comedy about death. The experience ‚Äúgrabbed my throat and held me to the fire‚Äù, he remembers. ‚ÄúI knew I was an actor.‚Äù It resonated so strongly that he staged a revival of On Borrowed Time a few years ago and, this year, directed a Zoom reading of it. He has returned to Cabaret, too, reprising the Emcee on stage in the 80s. It will always be his most famous role, but there have been many others on Broadway: as the showman George M Cohan (in George M!, the closure of which was blamed on Richard Nixon visiting backstage); the Wizard of Oz in the hit Wicked; luckless ‚ÄúMr Cellophane‚Äù Amos Hart in Chicago, also from Kander and Ebb; and most recently, wistful servant Firs in The Cherry Orchard in 2016.

A year earlier, Grey made headlines when he came out in People magazine at the age of 82. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like labels,‚Äù he told his interviewer, ‚Äúbut if you have to put a label on it, I‚Äôm a gay man.‚Äù It had taken time, he said, to ‚Äúembrace that other part of who I always was‚Äù. In his 2016 memoir, Master of Ceremonies, he wrote about how, since his youth, he had felt forced to hide his sexuality. Grey detailed early relationships, including with a bellboy at the residential hotel where his family lived in an apartment, and described a permanent hyper-alertness about being ‚Äúsmall, sissy, Jewish‚Äù. It is frequently a painful read: his mother is disgusted when he comes out to her as a teenager by telling her about a threesome he had with a cantor from their temple. When he tells his wife, Jo Wilder, about his past gay experiences it deepens a void between them that ends their 24-year marriage in the early 80s. Their children are the actor Jennifer Grey (Dirty Dancing) and James, a chef. Grey describes how important it was for them both to see him play a gay man on stage, in Larry Kramer‚Äôs landmark Aids drama The Normal Heart, to better understand their father.

One of Grey‚Äôs first film roles (as a smirking law student in Come September in 1961) was opposite Rock Hudson, who was leading his own double life as a gay man in Hollywood. Grey remembers him as ‚Äúa really nice, funny guy‚Äù. When Hudson died of complications from Aids in 1985, it increased awareness of an epidemic that for many was ‚Äútoo horrible to accept or think through‚Äù, Grey says. Denial and misinformation were rife. One scene in The Normal Heart required him to kiss another man. ‚ÄúA friend of mine said, you ought to find out from a doctor whether or not you are putting yourself at risk,‚Äù remembers Grey. ‚ÄúI called this doctor who was taking care of Rock Hudson. He said: ‚ÄòDo you have to kiss the actor?‚Äô I said: ‚ÄòYeah, it‚Äôs important in the script.‚Äô He said: ‚ÄòThen I wouldn‚Äôt do the play.‚Äô‚Äù Grey wrestled with it and chose the play and the kiss. ‚ÄúI said: ‚ÄòI need to tell this story. As an actor it‚Äôs my job.‚Äô And it‚Äôs what I live for.‚Äù He remembers Kramer, who died this year, as a ‚Äútough audience‚Äù, but ‚Äúvery supportive of my work‚Äù.

It is theatre, rather than film or TV, that has been Grey‚Äôs passion since his childhood debut. Back then he was Joel Katz. His grandparents were eastern European Jews who settled in Cleveland. Joel was the first of two sons born to Mickey, a musician and comedian who found fame with his Jewish revue the Borscht Capades, and Grace, who named him after her favourite actor, Joel McCrea, and hungered for him to become famous.

A pair of contrasting scenes in Grey‚Äôs memoir find him alone as a boy. In one, his mother takes him to New York for an audition that never materialises, and leaves him scared in their hotel room when she goes out with a man. In the other, he is accidentally abandoned in the theatre after hours but is unafraid and revels in its backstage magic. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want anybody to come and get me,‚Äù he tells me.

At nine, Grey craved a serious theatre career. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all I cared about.‚Äù But after appearing in his dad‚Äôs revue, he became a nightclub performer and was spotted by the entertainer Eddie Cantor who gave him a spot on his TV show in 1951 when Grey was 18. His whirlwind routine is on YouTube: wide-eyed and elfin-featured, Grey cracks jokes, barks like a seal, does the charleston and dances like a dream. It‚Äôs a five-minute delight but the result, he says, was that ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt get any parts in plays. They‚Äôd say: ‚ÄòOh no, he‚Äôs a TV guy‚Äô or ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a nightclub guy.‚Äô It kind of got in the way of my legitimacy.‚Äù His nightclub years included playing the London Palladium on a bill with Johnnie Ray, whose more fervent admirers threw Ray their underwear. ‚ÄúSometimes they forgot to clear the stage,‚Äù recalls Grey, who then had to dance a path between the knickers.

He was considering giving up acting when Cabaret came along. Where would he have gone? ‚ÄúAn art gallery,‚Äù he replies. ‚ÄúOr a hotdog stand.‚Äù The impish Emcee was the first theatre role he was offered without an audition. The songs may have been great but when he first read the script, he was alarmed that he had no dialogue and no direct involvement with the plot. The role was essentially a metaphor for seduction and corruption. ‚ÄúI was worried that it was one-dimensional, that he was a nightclub performer doing numbers.‚Äù That was precisely what Grey had been trying to escape. ‚ÄúI had to find out the psychology [of the Emcee] and who he was off stage so that hopefully I could bring that biography into those numbers.‚Äù

Six-year-old Jennifer would accompany him to the theatre, watching from the wings and even getting made up as one of the Kit Kat Girls in the seedy club. Elements of the Emcee‚Äôs look, notably the neatly combed hair and the bow tie, mirrored how Grey‚Äôs mother had dressed him as a child. Some of the makeup he used was his wife‚Äôs. His co-star Lotte Lenya ‚Äì celebrated chanteuse, ex-wife of Kurt Weill, and James Bond‚Äôs nemesis Rosa Klebb ‚Äì helped him with the German accent. Jill Haworth was Sally Bowles, the club dancer who longs for a gig at a respectable film studio ‚Äì surely a feeling Grey could relate to.

What made Cabaret so groundbreaking? ‚ÄúFirst of all, it was about a heinous and terrifying subject: the Holocaust. There were a lot of people who just wanted to forget about it. They tried to write it out of textbooks.‚Äù The musical‚Äôs unflinching account of antisemitism and persecution remains horribly current, much like Fiddler on the Roof, which Grey recently directed in a Yiddish version at New York‚Äôs Museum of Jewish Heritage. In the years immediately after the second world war, Mickey Katz had had hits with Yiddish parodies of popular songs (Haim Afen Range, for example, after Home on the Range). His father was, Grey wrote proudly in his memoir, ‚Äúinserting Jews into pop culture, so that we belonged, too‚Äù.

Grey says he and the producer-director, Hal Prince, were in ‚Äúlockstep‚Äù creating Cabaret together on Broadway. But when Bob Fosse came to direct the film version he did not want to inherit Grey‚Äôs Emcee. ‚ÄúThere was a total standoff.‚Äù It was Fosse who called him Mr Porno, but Grey insists: ‚ÄúHe was the original Mr Porno! He was in burlesque backstage when he was a teenager. He saw all that bizarreness as a kid and was attracted to it.‚Äù Grey came to believe that Fosse‚Äôs animosity towards him was because he wanted to play the Emcee himself. ‚ÄúHe was an excellent performer,‚Äù says Grey. ‚ÄúHe could have done it.‚Äù

At the Oscars, Grey beat three actors from The Godfather ‚Äì James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino ‚Äì and The Heartbreak Kid‚Äôs Eddie Albert. I imagine the Godfather mob glowering at him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve forgiven me!‚Äù he laughs.

Cabaret matched its Tony awards tally of eight wins ‚Äì including best director for Fosse and best actress for Liza Minnelli. When Grey‚Äôs name was read out at the Oscars ceremony, there was Minnelli behind him, dressed in canary yellow, rocking wildly with delight. She was a great choice to play Bowles, he thinks, and her own irresistible sense of fun came with a vulnerability, too. Minnelli would fall asleep on his shoulder on the early morning taxi drives from the hotel to the set. The pair went on to launch a nightclub act in Vegas that they toured around the US. One night, she introduced him on stage before he was ready but he strolled on trouser-less regardless. They performed separately and together, with a set list including Cabaret songs.

Decades later, people are still quoting the Emcee to him. Is it an albatross in any way? He shakes his head. ‚ÄúJust great.‚Äù He advances to the screen. ‚ÄúLet me come closer to you: just ‚Ä¶ great!‚Äù

It‚Äôs not the only boundary-breaking musical he has worked on. Grey has a small but joyous scene in Lars von Trier‚Äôs Dancer in the Dark, tap-dancing in a courtroom with Bj√∂rk. That looked like fun, I suggest. ‚ÄúWrong,‚Äù he barks back. ‚ÄúHard! The two of them [Bj√∂rk and Von Trier] were not connecting. [We] were in the midst of doing something very unique, and the star and the director weren‚Äôt talking.‚Äù

We‚Äôve rambled way beyond our allotted time and Grey has his scrapbook and his art to attend to. But he starts another story about visiting Cleveland‚Äôs art museum as a kid, finding rooms to hide in. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be in the Egyptian place getting into one of those sarcophaguses. I had this idea that I could hide in one of them.‚Äù His high-pitch exhale comes back, this time turning into a full ‚ÄúYahoo!‚Äù I wonder what he would say to nine-year-old Joel Katz, messing around in museums and embarking on his first stage role back in Cleveland. He replies: ‚ÄúStick with it, be who you are. It‚Äôs going to be tough.‚Äù There‚Äôs a beat. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs also going to be beautiful.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Scotland, where regions of the country are either in level 1, 2 or 3, no more than 20 people can attend a marriage ceremony or civil partnership.

1038,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire ‚Äì photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria‚Äôs 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: ‚ÄúWalking through the remains of Europe‚Äôs biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.‚Äù

A Valentine‚Äôs Day mug. Valentine‚Äôs Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

‚ÄúBetween the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone‚Äôs home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.‚Äù

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

‚ÄúThe owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.‚Äù

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

‚ÄúThis is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.‚Äù

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child‚Äôs shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1043,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London‚Äôs Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: ‚ÄúWithout the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

‚ÄúPolice took a measured response. You, however, didn‚Äôt engage with police ‚Äì police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.‚Äù

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge ‚Äì meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment ‚Äì after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park‚Äôs Speakers‚Äô Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by ‚Äúaddressing the gathering and encouraging ‚Ä¶ others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,‚Äù the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a ‚Äúlight-touch policing‚Äù approach by encouraging the gatherings to ‚Äúdisperse without the necessity for enforcement action‚Äù.

But Corbyn, he added, had ‚Äúdeliberately‚Äù participated in the gathering ‚Äúby way of making public addresses‚Äù and that he allegedly ‚Äúdisregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period‚Äù.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 ‚Äúis not a pandemic‚Äù and argue that ‚Äúif it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us‚Äù.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: ‚ÄúThis case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers‚Äô Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

‚ÄúMr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.‚Äù

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A ‚Äúblanket ban‚Äù on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve had a tremendous result.‚Äù",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1044,Tier 2 lockdown rules in England: the latest Covid restrictions explained,[],"The new system came into force in England on 2 December, replacing the national lockdown

England‚Äôs new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The ‚Äúrule of six‚Äù will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm ‚Äì with last orders at 10pm ‚Äì only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas ‚Äì from 23 December to 27 December ‚Äì there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

1045,'It's lovely to be back': on the streets of three-tier England as lockdown lifts,[],"England‚Äôs second national lockdown lifted on Wednesday, with 99% of the population placed under the second and third tiers of a three-tier regime. However, non-essential shops are allowed to open under every tier, giving shop owners hope for a much-needed high street boost ahead of Christmas. The Guardian went out on Wednesday to take the mood across the different zones.

Tier 1: St Ives

The Three Ferrets pub in the Cornish harbour-side town of St Ives was buzzing with chatter and laughter.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs lovely to be back,‚Äù said Richard Cockling, 83, a retired merchant seaman and fisherman as he sipped on a celebratory gin and tonic. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed this place. The latest lockdown has been the worst ‚Äì long and boring. I couldn‚Äôt wait to get back into this place.‚Äù

Keith Tickner, 59, a cleaner, settled down in his usual cosy spot in front of the blazing fire with a group of friends. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt realise how much you miss your mates and your routine until you‚Äôre allowed back,‚Äù he said.

St Ives, a long-beloved retreat for artists, beach lovers and surfers, was recently judged the happiest place to live in the UK. On the day it and the rest of Cornwall became the only area in mainland England to begin life in tier 1 it felt a jolly town to be in.

From first light, the town was packed with delivery lorries restocking the shops, cafes and restaurants. Bleary-eyed kitchen staff emerged from furlough to begin prepping for dinner time while shopkeepers polished windows and scrubbed floors.

‚ÄúLook at that cobweb,‚Äù said Paul Clegg, a potter who specialises in lucky Cornish piskies, his take on the leprechaun, as he buffed his windows. ‚ÄúThis is the best place in the country anyway. So many people who live here came on holiday, then just decided to stay because it‚Äôs so nice. But it does feel a particularly good day today.‚Äù

Opposite, Sarah Allen was putting up Christmas lights outside her cafe, Sky‚Äôs Diner. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good to be back.‚Äù She expected to be busy. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôll get visitors coming from all over the country who want a taste of life in tier 1,‚Äù she said.

Cornwall council‚Äôs leader, Julian German, called it a ‚Äúhuge moment‚Äù for the county but asked people not to drop their guard. ‚ÄúCovid doesn‚Äôt care what tier we‚Äôre in,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄòWe live in a bit of a bubble here‚Äô: Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor shop. Photograph: Jim Wileman/The Guardian

The advantages of living in tier 1 include being allowed to have a drink in a pub without a meal and to meet in a group of up to six indoors as well as outside.

People from tier 3 areas have been urged by the council not to visit Cornwall and the police this week revealed that up to 10 extra cars would be patrolling Devon and Cornwall to deal with Covid rule-breakers.

The council said people from tier 2 areas should bring the restrictions they are subject to at home with them ‚Äúlike hand luggage‚Äù. For example, those in tier 2, should have a ‚Äúsubstantial meal‚Äù with their pub drink.

Of course, enforcing such rules are difficult. The Pilchard Press, a real ale pub tucked up an alley near the harbour, was taking no chances. It had fixed a notice to its railings reading: ‚ÄúCornwall residents only‚Äù.

At the Golden Lion pub, licensee Matt Squires said he would be politely asking people where they are from if he did not recognise them. ‚ÄúWe plan to keep people from different tiers separate,‚Äù he said. Locals will be able to use the front bar looking on to the street, visitors the back bar.

Raven Williams, owner of the Common Wanderer outdoor clothes shop, said that tier 1 living would not change much for many people. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs good for the shops but actually we live in a bit of a bubble here, close to nature and the water. It‚Äôs why people like it.‚Äù SM

Tier 2: Liverpool

‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt seem as scared to come out‚Äô: Rob Pritchard, manager at vintage clothes shop Resurrection in Liverpool. Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian

Vans lined up outside the independent shops and restaurants on Liverpool‚Äôs Bold Street in the morning drizzle to deliver stock to eager staff. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre feeling festive, we‚Äôve got our Christmas music on and our twinkly lights on,‚Äù said Nicki Whatling, a manager at Rennie‚Äôs Arts and Crafts, as picture frames were unloaded into the store.

While the shop has only 23 days to make up the bulk of lost sales over lockdown, she said she was hopeful the business could ‚Äúhave a fairly decent December‚Äù.

As the day wore on, Whatling‚Äôs wishes began to look more likely, with throngs of Christmas shoppers trickling up and down the city‚Äôs streets. At the vintage clothes store Resurrection, where students were sifting through leisurewear and parents were picking out gifts, the director Rob Pritchard said there had ‚Äúbeen a buzz about the place‚Äù in the middle of the day.

Usually, he said, the store would be much quieter in early December after the Black Friday sales weekend, but he predicted the store would continue to be busy throughout this month. ‚ÄúA lot of people are saying they‚Äôre taking the chance to get back into the city again. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that today,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWhen we ended the last lockdown some people were still too scared to come out. This time maybe because the infection rates have fallen so much in Liverpool, they don‚Äôt seem as scared to come.‚Äù

Meanwhile, at the pizza restaurant Crust, the manager Antonio Fornaro was grateful the venue had been able to open ahead of Christmas. ‚ÄúWhen they announced it, I had calls from all my colleagues saying, ‚ÄòYes! We‚Äôre going to be able to open‚Äô,‚Äù he said.

Throughout England‚Äôs second national lockdown, takeaway sales had dropped off as people reigned in spending, said Fornaro. But on Wednesday afternoon, the reduced tables and chairs in the restaurant were full once again.

Outside the trainer store Size?, university student Adam Macholc, 18, was one of a small socially distanced group of sneakerheads waiting for the latest Adidas drop as staff inside got ready to open. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm buying them for myself,‚Äù he said, adding that despite a turbulent first term, ‚Äúit feels like there‚Äôs a bit more hope‚Äù after the news that the UK had approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

In Liverpool‚Äôs main commercial shopping district, around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre, other shoppers seemed to be feeling confident too. A queue snaked around the city‚Äôs Primark store, while shoppers trickled in and out of Debenhams to pick up a bargain.

Willing some of them to stop for a substantial meal and a drink on their way home, was the manager of the Doctor Duncan‚Äôs pub, Amy McCarthy. Under tier 2 regulations, a key difference with tier 1 is alcohol cannot be served without food and there must be no multiple household mixing in venues like Doctor Duncan‚Äôs. The pub, located away from the main shopping centre next to Liverpool Lime Street station, had a quiet day with only a handful of customers.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre right next to the bus stops where people usually head to football games and are known for being the first and the last stop. So it‚Äôs different territory for us having to emphasise our pub grub,‚Äù she said. AW

Tier 3: Nottingham

After a month cooped up indoors, shoppers in Nottingham seized the opportunity to return to the city centre on Wednesday.

The east Midlands city is back in tier 3, and is therefore subject to England‚Äôs toughest coronavirus restrictions. Shops, hair salons and gyms have been allowed to reopen, but hospitality venues must offer takeaway or delivery only.

In the city centre, stallholders were preparing for this weekend‚Äôs opening of the Christmas market on Old Market Square, in the heart of the city.

The prime location is overlooked by an imposing six-storey stone building which houses the department store Debenhams, and on the other side of the square is a Dorothy Perkins and a Burton ‚Äì brands that are part of Philip Green‚Äôs Arcadia empire. Both Debenhams and Arcadia are living on borrowed time, having collapsed into administration on consecutive days this week

If Arcadia‚Äôs brands do not find a buyer, Nottingham will feel the impact of store closures keenly. The city is home to nine Arcadia stores ‚Äì .

Tallulah Harries-Pugh, 29, was holding a Topshop carrier bag, but with an item to return rather than a new purchase.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with Sir Philip Green‚Äôs ethics, and I try not to shop [at Arcadia brands],‚Äù said Tallulah. But she said she was worried about the staff, and what more store closures would mean for the high street.

The scars of another recent retail collapse are clearly visible in Nottingham city centre. One of the city‚Äôs two shopping centres, Broadmarsh, was half-demolished with plans under way for a multimillion pound redevelopment, when its owner, the retail property company Intu, collapsed in June.

The city council has been handed the keys to the development and has already spent ¬£19m on the project. Councillor Sam Webster, whose ward covers the city centre, concedes it won‚Äôt be a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù.

‚ÄúIt is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity. The project is probably the biggest regeneration in a core city in the country‚Äù.

In the short-term, however, Nottingham‚Äôs businesses have to contend with tier 3 restrictions.

Prof David Paton from Nottingham University business school warns that retailers will feel the impact of cafe, pub and restaurant closures. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of interlinkage between high street hospitality and shops. Nottingham is going to face that, as all tier 3 will.‚Äù

In a normal year the nine stainless steel fermenting vessels at the Castle Rock brewery near the city‚Äôs train station would be full, ahead of the expected peak in demand during the festive season. This December they are empty.

‚ÄòWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas‚Äô: Colin Wilde, MD of Castle Rock brewery in Nottingham. Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The Guardian

‚ÄúWe won‚Äôt brew again before Christmas,‚Äù said the managing director, Colin Wilde. The brewer and pub operator has 22 sites in Nottingham and across the east Midlands, all in tier 3.

The company now offers takeaway alcohol from its brewery and pubs, but it brings in less than 10% of normal trade, and Wilde said the closed pubs ‚Äúleak cash‚Äù.

‚ÄúAs a sector, we feel like canaries in a cage. It feels like politicians are testing things out on the hospitality sector and don‚Äôt think it matters if it dies.‚Äù JP",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1046,No 10 and regulator contradict Hancock's 'because of Brexit' Covid vaccine claim,[],"Both Downing Street and the UK‚Äôs medicines regulator have contradicted a claim by Matt Hancock that Brexit helped the UK become the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus.

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that ‚Äúbecause of Brexit‚Äù the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK‚Äôs decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK‚Äôs Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. ‚ÄúWe have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,‚Äù said June Raine, the MHRA‚Äôs chief executive.

Timeline UK Covid-19 restrictions: the key political dates ahead Show Hide Here are some of the key dates ahead for the UK's Covid-19 restrictions. The current lockdown in England ends, and the new strengthened tier system comes into force with nearly 99% of England headed for the strictest two tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day ‚Äì decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a ‚Äúsunset‚Äù clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs‚Äô approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock‚Äôs stated view, Boris Johnson‚Äôs spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

‚ÄúI think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,‚Äù he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôve said, it‚Äôs clear that we‚Äôre the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it‚Äôs obviously incredibly positive news.‚Äù

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat job of working with the company to look at that data as it‚Äôs come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would‚Äù.

Hancock continued: ‚ÄúThe second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we‚Äôve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing ‚Äúfast and loose with the facts‚Äù over the vaccine. The party‚Äôs health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim ‚Äúis not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look‚Äù.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock‚Äôs department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA‚Äôs ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as ‚Äúpart of wider conversations‚Äù about the MHRA‚Äôs lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA‚Äôs role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

I thought there‚Äôd be a lotion or a candle recommendation, but nope. Just her saying that the can also makes a handy ashtray. Jeez, y‚Äôknow?

But would we have served [Yippy founder] Abbie Hoffman‚Äôs memory better by removing the heartbreaking moment where he breaks down in tears under cross-examination, stands up his seat, and shouts ‚ÄòYour honor, I‚Äôm not sure we see eye to eye on everything, but I fervently agree with Joe Biden that we must restore the soul of this country‚Äô? I don‚Äôt think so. Just think about it. These men were progressives; many people who support Joe Biden now are progressives.

Yep, that‚Äôs right. Thanks to our connections, the bird known as the Great Northern Diver has now been sanctioned as the avian ambassador for PC and console users alike.

You‚Äôre welcome, readers. Don‚Äôt say we‚Äôve never done anything for you.

How did we do it, you ask? How did we manage to get the monogamous, crustacean-eating Nearctic waterfowl appointed as the official gaming bird? Well, having spent decades as the i nternet‚Äôs premiere website for video game journalism, we‚Äôve made some friends in high places. Let‚Äôs just say we reached out to our people at the Audubon Society, called in a few favors from some old business associates at the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, and, well, we managed to work something out.

That‚Äôs not important, though. What is important is that the common loon, with its vibrant plumage and highly adept fishing skills, is now a certified symbol for gamers around the world, from JRPG fans to Battle Royale esports champions and everyone in between, and you have us to thank for it.

We could‚Äôve settled for the yellow-rumped warbler or the northern cardinal, but no. We wanted only the best for you, gamers.

After getting off the phone with a representative at DuPont, it turns out that 9.8 pounds of silicon and plastic is way more affordable than we assumed, meaning you can own the quantity of materials that make up an Xbox Series X for a mere $8.27!

Looks like Christmas came early for any gamers looking to buy the constituent components making up the hottest ticket of this holiday system!



Sure, Microsoft‚Äôs latest and greatest console might be backordered at every electronics store in the country, but that‚Äôs no excuse for not owning the basic materials that form its semiconductors and casing‚Äîand at a fraction of the cost! In fact, if you buy it wholesale at scale‚Äîwe‚Äôre talking 200 to 300 pounds of silicon‚Äîyou can get it for even cheaper. Of course, owning five palettes of industrial-grade silicon might be a bit much for the average gamer, but for the right person, it would mean having the equivalent of 30 Xbox Series Xs. Think about that!

Just imagine the look your friends will have when you invite them over to check out your new Xbox and you point out the pallet of chemical materials sitting on your entertainment center. Heck, you could even take a welding class for only an additional $125 or so at the local adult education center, and then you‚Äôre almost all the way to owning this face-melting graphical powerhouse. Assuming you get some sort of engineering degree, you could even melt the plastic down in an industrial furnace, form it into a shape approximating the real thing, and paint it matte black. Pretty cool, huh?

It‚Äôs enough to put a smile on any Microsoft fanboy or fangirl‚Äôs face!

Plus, Halo Infinite might not even be out yet, but the polycarbonate that its 4K Blu-Ray is made out of only costs $1.90 per pound. Picture the jealousy in your best bud‚Äôs eyes when you pull out a handful of that, point to it, and say, ‚ÄúT his could be Master Chief‚Äôs next adventure and it‚Äôs all mine! ‚Äù Really, all you‚Äôd have to do is carve the polycarbonate into 0.6 MM layers, then use a laser to inscribe it in just the right way and you‚Äôd be well on your way to getting the first-ever playable copy of 343 Industry‚Äôs next sci-fi epic in the whole world!

But jump on this deal quick, gamers! Once people catch wind that they could be getting their hands on a real-life approximation of the Series X for pennies on the dollar, they‚Äôre going to be standing in line outside every raw material supplier‚Äôs warehouse in the country. Heck, we‚Äôll say it.

Soaring ahead of its competition, the PS5 is a game-changing next- generation console that Santa just can‚Äôt afford right now, okay, S port?

Sadly, things are a little tight money-wise in Santa‚Äôs Workshop at the moment, C hamp, if that makes sense.



Building on the success of the PS4, the gigantic new console pushes gaming to a whole new level, utilizing an AMD-powered GPU that can process 10.28 teraflops for the most immersive user experience to date. Santa would simply love to get one for you, Slugger, if the economy wasn‚Äôt so bad right now that it‚Äôs even affecting the North Pole.

Perhaps most impressive of all the PS5 ‚Äô s features is its DualSense controller, whose minimalist aesthetic belies a sophisticated interface with greatly improved haptic feedback that allows you to feel as though you‚Äôre really there with every raindrop, or at least, you would feel that way if the bank could have just cut Santa some slack with interest payments on his magical sled.

Preloaded with the enjoyable, if not revolutionary, platformer Astro‚Äôs Playroom, which serves mostly as a demo reel of the console‚Äôs newest technologies, there are actually two editions of the system available: one including a 4K Blu-ray drive with a price tag of $499, and the slimmer Digital Edition, which at $100 less is still too big an expense for Santa what with all the payments for someone to babysit all of his reindeer and little elves.

Of course, the PS5 is not completely perfect. There are some noticeable flubs here and there, including an overreliance on outmoded options menus and a counterintuitive home button configuration, so no need to cry, Buddy, huh? It‚Äôs not because of anything you did. You‚Äôve been so good this year! Santa still loves you very, very much, and I promise there‚Äôs so much other fun other stuff you‚Äôre going to get this year that you won‚Äôt even miss the PlayStation, honest!



Remember how much you like Air Bud? Well, let‚Äôs just say ol‚Äô Saint Nick got his hands on the DVDs for a few sequels this holiday season.

Thanks to its impressive engineering, backwards compatibility, and exciting pipeline of new titles showing off exactly what the next-gen is all about, we‚Äôre sure the PS5 is going to be around for quite a while. So dry your eyes, Chief, and think about how much more you‚Äôll appreciate the system when you get it for your birthday next year or maybe next Christmas depending on how a couple of Santa‚Äôs job interviews pan out.

1110,"Ah, Shoot: We Forgot To Drain Our Xbox Over The Weekend And Now All The Game Fluid Leaked Out",[],"Well, dang it. We‚Äôre feeling pretty annoyed right now because we just walked into the OGN offices after taking the weekend off and we were met with a nasty surprise: W e forgot to drain our new Xbox Series X over the weekend, and now all the game fluid leaked out.

Ugh, this sucks.

Obviously, the manual says to drain your Series X every six to eight hours with the included syringe, but we just completely neglected to head into work a few times to open up the excess valve and make sure the video game runoff didn‚Äôt gunk up the works. It really spilled everywhere‚Äî the whole outside of the console is green with congealed gaming fluid, the fluid valve has shattered from excess pressure, and it looks like a fair amount of the stuff even dripped down the table and seeped into the carpet.

Advertisement

This is a major drag, and it‚Äôs made all the worse by the fact that we have no one to blame but ourselves. We even remember thinking on Friday, ‚ÄúHmm, it‚Äôs been a while since anyone drained the Xbox, and we‚Äôve been going pretty hard on Demon‚Äôs Souls lately, so we probably need to soon.‚Äù On the other hand, it was the end of the day and we didn‚Äôt want to have to walk all the way to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. Oh well, we suppose hindsight is 20/20.

Oh, crap. Now that we‚Äôve been standing in here for a little while, it‚Äôs really clear that the distinctive bitter gaming fluid smell has seeped into most of the fabric, too. God, it‚Äôs really noxious. Maybe it would help if we open a window or something.

Advertisement

We guess this is just one of those things that happens to you once and then you learn your lesson. Suffice it to say, we won‚Äôt leave the office again without double-checking each and every one of our Xboxes to en sure the gaming fluid dial is at 50% or lower. Honestly, at this point, this whole thing has been such a headache, so we‚Äôre thinking about maybe even investing in one of those automatic fluid changers that they sell on Hammacher Schlemmer.

Okay, gamers, well we‚Äôre going to grab some Lysol and paper towels and try to dab out some of it out of the drapes, but honestly, we don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs going to require a professional cleaning or what. Yuck. What a morning.",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

We know there‚Äôs one game left in this generation that‚Äôs been getting you more pumped than anything else. In fact, this open-world RPG from CD Projekt Red is probably one of the things that has kept you going through this tough year. But we need to just come clean and get this off our backs: Cyberpunk 2077 is not a real game. It was just something we made up to sound cool and interesting in front of you so you would like us and now that lie is spinning completely out of control.



Advertisement

Please don‚Äôt hate us.

Now, we‚Äôre sure your mad. We know you were counting down the days until you could explore a fully realized Night City as part of the ultra-customizable gameplay you‚Äôve been seeing in hands-on videos for months. But it‚Äôs a lie. It‚Äôs all a goddamn lie and we‚Äôre sorry. We just really like when you hang out on the site, and we wanted you to stick around. That‚Äôs why we made it up way back in 2012 and got the developer to play along.

Advertisement

This started as a dumb little fib about something we thought you would like and now it‚Äôs become this huge weight on our chest, getting heavier and heavier every day. We just couldn‚Äôt keep it down anymore without having a panic attack.



We know what you are thinking. The screenshots? The previews? Our art department created it all. We thought we could keep up the charade for a year or two more with a trickle of delays and impressions about the gangs, the dynamic police system, all of it. But in the back of our heads, we always knew that one day, you would expect this game to come out and we would be caught.



Advertisement

Some of this is on you. Why do you think it‚Äôs been delayed so many times? We flirted with the idea of canceling it all together, saying CD Projekt Red had gone bankrupt or something. But then we would have never been free from the manacles of this lie.



We were just insecure, you know? There are so many video game sites out there and we‚Äôve always kind of felt like outcasts. Talking about Cyberpunk was the first time we ever really felt like we were part of something, like you actually wanted to hear what we had to say. In a way we wanted it to be real‚Äîthe customizable weapons and slow-motion combat sequences. It all sounded so cool and we didn‚Äôt want to let you down. Please don‚Äôt blame us. After all, our intentions were good.

We did this for you, even if we only ended up hurting you.

To be fair you probably should have figured it out years ago. The idea of a sci-fi shooter from the makers of The Witcher series was always a bit of a wish fulfillment fantasy wasn‚Äôt it? Obviously, we‚Äôre not trying to absolve ourselves of this. But we kind of assumed you would catch on when we claimed Keanu Reeves was going to be in the game. That doesn‚Äôt make any sense if you just think about it for a second. But we just blurted it out a few months ago, and then all it took was hiring him for a few press appearances and we were in the clear again.

Advertisement

At least, until now.



So, listen, what we are trying to say is: We‚Äôre very sorry. This video game is never going to come out. It doesn‚Äôt ev en exist. Of course, we understand if you never trust us again to deliver honest coverage of the industry. On the plus side, getting this all out there makes us feel like we can finally breathe again without hating ourselves. We‚Äôre sure you‚Äôll need some time to process this, and we could use a little time to ourselves to figure out why we‚Äôre like this.

The First 100 OGE Attendees To Stop By The Nintendo Booth Today Will Get A Free Sample Of What Pikmin Taste Like,[],"With thousands flocking through the doors at the Zweibel Convention Center to attend our first-ever Onion Gamer Expo, some of the best swag is going and going fast. But we‚Äôre about to give you an inside scoop on one of the coolest offers of the whole conference: The first 100 OGE attendees to stop by the Nintendo Booth today will get a free sample of what Pikmin really taste like!

Hurry up! This is a deal that‚Äôs too good to miss!

We‚Äôre talking Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White, Rock and Flying Pikmin, sliced up and ready for your enjoyment! So drop whatever you‚Äôre doing and come on by the Nintendo Gaming Experience to get an absolutely free, no-questions-asked sample. And if you‚Äôre worried about trying such an exotic cut of meat, don‚Äôt worry! These are flame-grilled, beautifully seasoned, and butchered into perfectly bite-sized cubes, so you won‚Äôt even imagine a Pikmin‚Äôs cute little face while you‚Äôre chowing down.

Admittedly, there‚Äôs a certain crunch to the Pikmin meat that might be a bit unnerving if this is your first time. That‚Äôs from their tiny bones and inner tendons, which aren‚Äôt removed in most traditional preparations. After you understand that, you‚Äôll realize those crunchier and chewier components actually lend a nice textural component. And the meat‚Äôs flavor? It has this sweet and savory mix that you‚Äôve got to experience for yourself to believe.

If you want to get really adventurous, there are also a few Bulbmin samples, too. But watch out! One out of every hundred preparations is supposed to be poisonous.

As an added incentive, the Nintendo employees are also providing wine pairings for the first 50 attendees. That really helps wash down the gamier taste of these half-plant, half-animal bites. They‚Äôre also offering complimentary silk cloth s to cover your face if you want to avoid offending G od with this culinary trespass against the laws of nature. Just remember, they‚Äôre flying off the sample tray, so get on over here for your own bite of these little critters as soon as you can!",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1115,"Someone Needs To Explain: The Upcoming Games In The ‚ÄòMario,‚Äô ‚ÄòGTA,‚Äô and ‚ÄòMetal Gear Solid‚Äô Series Are All Called ‚ÄòThe Sands Of Time‚Äô",[],"Okay gamers, here at OGN, we pride ourselves on providing the most comprehensive look at the much- anticipated video games. But now we have a piece of truly perplexing news that we‚Äôre going to need someone to sort out for us. Today, in separate press conferences, the biggest publishers in the world just revealed that the upcoming installments in the Super Mario, Grand Theft Auto, and Metal Gear Solid franchises are somehow all subtitled ‚Äú The Sands of Time‚Äù ?



Advertisement

Your guess is as good as ours, gamers. We got nothing on this one.

While we‚Äôre incredibly excited to have Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Hideo Kojima all taking the stage on the same day, we‚Äôre also having a tremendous amount of trouble wrapping our heads around why each of the developers‚Äô latest games seems to be named after the 2003 action-platformer set in ancient Persia‚Äîor are they? We really have no idea.

Advertisement

It‚Äôs especially confusing given that most of the titles in some way makes use of an hourglass in the graphic. You could argue that it was just a mistake if it only happened to be one of these companies that adopted the ‚ÄúSands of Time‚Äù suffix. But all three? It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

Super Mario: Sands of Time. Grand Theft Auto: The Sands of Time. Metal Gear Solid: The Sands of Time. We‚Äôre not going to act like these aren‚Äôt cool titles. They definitely are. But we‚Äôd assume that Ubisoft would have the exclusive rights to that phrase. Even if not, why would any other game developer want to associate their games with such an iconic phrase? It‚Äôs simply not possible that nobody at any of these three major video game companies had ever heard of the original ‚ÄúSands of Time‚Äù game. That was one of the most popular titles of the sixth console generation.

Advertisement

Does anyone understand how this could have happened? Anyone?

We‚Äôre just going to go ahead and assume that each game has some sort of time-travel element too, but why would these publishers do that? How could all three of them possibly use this mechanic in an inventive way?

Advertisement

Please don‚Äôt take our confusion as negativity, gamers. These are huge announcements for some of the most popular franchises in video game history. We‚Äôre talking about a new Metal Gear Solid, a series long thought dead since Kojima‚Äôs departure from Konami. And new titles in Mario and Grand Theft Auto? This is incredibly exciting stuff. All we‚Äôre saying is that it‚Äôs kind of incomprehensible why any single one of them would choose to have a title that had already been used 17 years ago.

We reached out to programmers at Nintendo, Rockstar, and Konami about it, but they refused to respond and seemed genuinely angry that we questioned this baffling decision.

Advertisement

Are they fucking with us?

Seriously, gamers, if anyone knows what the hell is going on here please let us know. Maybe there‚Äôs some sort of movement to establish ‚ÄúSands of Time‚Äù as its own video game genre subset that we don‚Äôt know about? Or for some reason, all future video ga mes will be named after Prince Of Persia games or Jake Gyllenhaal films?

Xbox fanboys, looks like your dreams of getting an up-close-and-personal look at the Chief are finally being fulfilled‚Äîand his dental hygiene is more upsetting than anyone could have ever predicted.



Ever since we stepped foot into the legendary Spartan‚Äôs MJOLNIR armor way back in 2001 with Halo: Combat Evolved, the single-player campaigns have always left us with the same tantalizing question: What was going on inside that helmet? Well, with this sneak peek at the yellowed, cavity-ridden teeth inside of Master Chief‚Äôs mouth, we‚Äôre finally getting an answer, albeit a viscerally disturbing one that none of us specifically requested.



Of course, there is a distinct satisfaction to looking over the Chief‚Äôs gingivitis-plagued gum line and impacted molars and realizing this is the Spartan who saved the human race from the Covenant. But as rewarding as it is for fans to finally take a gander at the pieces of decayed meat caught up in his bleeding gums and crooked teeth, all of this just raises more tantalizing questions: ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt Master Chief ever brush his teeth?‚Äù; ‚ÄúHas he considered braces for those repulsive things?‚Äù; and ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he bothered by his apparently severe halitosis while he‚Äôs cooped up inside that metal suit?‚Äù

At the very least, this answers how the hero known as John-117 managed to avoid seeing a dentist even once as he fought countless battles against the Flood, as well as giving gamers a great reminder of how important regular visits with their dental hygienists are. Plus, getting this close to the Chief‚Äôs mouth‚Äîno matter how repulsive‚Äîjust makes us more excited than ever to get our hands on Halo: Infinite! Here‚Äôs hoping it‚Äôs worth the wait.

We‚Äôve witnessed some amazing panels, dream-come-true announcements, and a few moments that surprised even us. Still, there‚Äôs one small detail that‚Äôs been irking us. Gamers, are you not seeing all the olives we left around the expo hall for you? There are, like, $ 500 worth here, and it‚Äôd be a huge waste if no one scooped them up and tried a few.



Advertisement

We left all of these olives out for you, guys! So really, feel free to have at ‚Äô em!

Look, readers, we thought this would be a nice treat for everyone, so it‚Äôs just a bit of a bummer that we scattered these olives around the convention center and nobody is even picking them up to try a little nibble. Now, it‚Äôs possible no one has noticed them, but we really tried to make sure that wasn‚Äôt the case. There are olive on tables, some are on the floor, some are in baskets. Anywhere you look, there are olives.

Advertisement

These aren‚Äôt some cheap prepackaged olives from the grocery store, either. Maybe that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre worried about? We went to a nice cheese store and picked them up before the show. We‚Äôre talking green and black. Even a few stuffed with blue cheese. Please understand, that‚Äôs hundreds of dollars from our pockets down the drain if you don‚Äôt even take a little nibble.

Come on, gamers, why are you stepping over them like they‚Äôre trash? These are really great olives. Some of them are K alamatas straight from Greece, some have rosemary in the brine. There are even these spicy buffalo- flavored ones that are really nice, too. Even if you don‚Äôt want a ton of olives, you can be nice about it and just grab a couple.

Advertisement

Hell, if you really don‚Äôt like olives, all you have to do is put them on your plate, walk around with them for a little bit, and then throw them out while we aren‚Äôt looking.

Honestly, we‚Äôre a little annoyed with you right now, gamers. We sent out an email to see if anybody had dietary restrictions and no one even responded, so we were left to assume everyone was cool with olives. And now we‚Äôve basically spent 500 dollars on nothing.

Advertisement

Think about it: How would that make you feel?

Now, we will take some ownership that we should have left them in jars instead of just putting them down on the conference floor and booths. But we had this image in our head that it would set up a nice tableau, and then we just ran with it. Who knows? Maybe we got overly excited about putting olives everywhere. Either way, their brine is probably an antibacterial, so it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs going to get you sick by just picking them up and popping one in your mouth.

Listen, we‚Äôre not perfect. Not by a long shot. We‚Äôll admit that a pitted snack might not be the best thing for a video game conference without many trash cans. But you could have at least told us you didn‚Äôt enjoy olives before the conference started. We just wanted to do something nice for you and now you‚Äôre making us feel like jerks.

This wasn‚Äôt out of some food discretionary fund, either. All of our writers pooled their own money in a little manila envelope labeled ‚ÄúOLIVES‚Äù because we thought it would be a great reward for our attendees.

Look, we‚Äôre just going to say it: This is total bullshit.

After a week of exclusive previews and gameplay teasers, we were unbelievably pumped to finally get our hands on CD Projekt Red‚Äôs sprawling new science-fiction RPG. Unfortunately, just as we were about to grab a controller to jump into the neon-lit wonder of Night City, a dozen Projekt Red employees barged through the door, commandeered every single one of the controllers, and haven‚Äôt stopped playing for the past 30 minutes. They didn‚Äôt even seem to care that there was a massive line of fans who had been waiting for hours to catch a glimpse of the new perk trees and stealth mechanics over their shoulders. Goddamnit.

What‚Äôs worse is that we have repeatedly and respectfully asked their designers and coders to step aside and let someone else play, stressing that they must have playtested the game thousands of times by now over the five-year development cycle. But they just either outright ignored us or laughed in our face! It‚Äôs unbelievable. There are signs mounted everywhere that say ‚ÄúLimit 15 Minutes‚Äù‚Äîsigns that they mounted themselves‚Äîand these pricks don‚Äôt even seem to care.

Jesus Christ, one of them just quit out of the game entirely so she could boot up Celeste. That‚Äôs not what this booth is for, you jerks! C‚Äômon!

Well, we are calling it, this is fucking unacceptable, gamers. This is our expo and we want to play Cyberpunk, or at least watch it without Mike Pondsmith deliberately obstructing our view. If CD Projekt Red wants to thumb their noses at the rules and act like a bunch of spoiled assholes, they will pay the price.

Oof. We really don‚Äôt know what to make of this.

See, Mr. Miyamoto, the legendary game designer for Nintendo, was originally scheduled to give a presentation on the main stage earlier this week. As abiding fans of everything he‚Äôs contributed to the history of video games, we were all really excited by a rumor that he might be making a big announcement about an upcoming Mario game. He didn‚Äôt show up, though, and we didn‚Äôt hear anything from him or his representatives about where he was. Ultimately, we assumed he had canceled due to an illness.

Advertisement

Flash forward to today, spectators at the Cyberpunk 2077 demonstration noticed an unhealthily obese, middle-aged Japanese man standing completely still in the middle of the Marvel‚Äôs Avengers tent, emptily staring at an exit sign. We didn‚Äôt recognize him at first, but after taking a second look, we realized, dear God, that‚Äôs Shigeru Miyamoto, and he looks like he‚Äôs in horrible shape.

What the hell is going on, gamers?

Our first concern wasn‚Äôt that he had missed delivering Monday‚Äôs exclusive OGE Nintendo Direct. The more pressing thing was that Miyamoto appeared to be eating from a three-pound sack full of pistachios while repeatedly muttering the word ‚Äúliars‚Äù under his breath in a near-catatonic state. His shirt is completely stained and rumpled, and, well, let‚Äôs just say he doesn‚Äôt smell great. It‚Äôs like a combination of rubbing alcohol and really badly burnt clay‚Äîit makes you gag a little just getting a whiff from far away.

After overcoming our distress, we tried to approach the designer behind The Legend Of Zelda and Super Mario and ask what he thought of the conference, and he just said, ‚ÄúMaybe I will‚Äîmaybe I fucking will‚Äîsee how they feel about it‚Äù before wandering off to the Epic Games booth, where he‚Äôs now just glaring at Tim Sweeney and breathing loudly. We‚Äôre really scared, and we‚Äôre not sure why.

Readers, should we call an ambulance or something?

Either way, we‚Äôll keep an eye on him for you, and let you know if there are any updates.

Go dd ammit, what a complete asshole!

As one of the many truly unique facets of the OGN g aming c onference, we were able to partner with EA Games to give each of our attendees a free pen bearing the video game developer‚Äôs logo completely free of charge. When Cliff Bleszinski first arrived he took three or four of them‚Äî a reasonable amount of pens that should satisfy the average person. But it‚Äôs apparently not enough for the greedy prick. We‚Äôre well aware that we didn‚Äôt have a sign that indicated only taking just one, but this is unbelievable.

We were under the impression that Bleszinski was excited to talk to an audience about his design philosophy with the Gears franchise and maybe sign a few copies , but when it came time for the panel we scheduled, he was peeling out from the parking lot cackling to himself with a van full of our precious EA Games pens.

Cliff Bleszinski, you unconscionable bastard!

What‚Äôs disappointing is this was one of the main points of promotion for this conference. We paid an ungodly amount for targeted ads to gamers that read ‚Äú Come to the OGE and receive a free white EA Games click pen!‚Äù Now we‚Äôre left wondering if the only reason why Bleszinski agreed to the conference in the first place was so he could sneak behind our booth to steal boxes of pens while the security guard wasn‚Äôt looking.

Given that he took every pen we had, it‚Äôs hard to tell if this was simply an act of Machiavellian self-interest or some kind of declaration of war against our conference itself. You have to assume that he has the money to buy 10,000 pens if he wants. But why would someone need this many pens? Maybe he intends to offload them to a fence who can sell them on the black market.

Regardless of the reason, this is a huge dick move.

Christ, sorry you had to find out like this, gamers. But Cliff Bleszinski is the true scum of the Earth for taking off with all 10,000 of our EA Games pens, and we also sincerely apologize that nobody else will get the opportunity to have a free pen.

We seriously just want to kill ourselves right now, readers!

What makes this even worse is that we know for a fact that Deborah never even wanted to hold a video game conference before she heard about ours. We were nice enough to suggest that she come to OGE like a week after we had the idea, and she just said, ‚ÄúOh yeah, maybe.‚Äù But now she‚Äôs invited all the same people that were on our guest list and got American celebrity chef Bobby Flay himself to put together little finger sandwiches and lamb kebab lollipops, while we‚Äôre still stuck trying to get Mangiano‚Äôs House of Pizza to donat e some free bread sticks and soda.

We can‚Äôt help but think this is all a lot of horseshit, gamers. After the months of hard work we put into OGE, Deborah just up and throws her own bash o n the first weekend of August? There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs a coincidence. Plus, we can‚Äôt do anything to upstage her because her parents are executives at Wells Fargo or something and can afford to hire culinary master Bobby Flay and rent out a karaoke machine to play 8 -bit versions of pop songs for the whole night. Meanwhile, we all had to get part-time jobs to pay for the streamers that we picked up at Party City. Also, Deborah gets an allowance of $300 a week just for sweeping the kitchen, but she makes their housekeeper do it most of the time anyway, and she‚Äôs not even spending any of that money on her video game expo!

Look, let‚Äôs be real: Deborah isn‚Äôt even an actual gamer‚Äî she‚Äôs just doing this because she likes that guy Brock on the varsity basketball team and she knows he‚Äôs into video games. Sure, Deborah‚Äôs family has a Nintendo Switch and she plays Animal Crossing: New Horizons sometimes, but that‚Äôs not enough to explain a sudden interest in having thousands of people flock to a rented-out convention center for a whole five-day gaming extravaganza featuring a chef extraordinaire with his own show on the Food Network.

It‚Äôs just like the time she debuted her own Portal 2 demo impressions right before we did so people would vote for her for homecoming queen.

Then again, we all know why more people might show up to Deb orah‚Äôs thing. She‚Äôs easy. Like, really easy. Yeah, we said it.

She‚Äôs also totally flat and stuffs her bra, but you didn‚Äôt hear that from us, gamers.

1125,NBA Figures They Garnered Enough Praise To Let All The Players Get Covid Now,[],"NEW YORK‚ÄîRationalizing that the league was effectively above criticism at this point, a spokesperson for the National Basketball Association confirmed Tuesday that they had probably garnered enough praise from last summer‚Äôs ‚ÄúNBA Bubble‚Äù to let all the players contract coronavirus during the upcoming season. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre riding high on five months of adulation for the way we handled the bubble, so whatever happens next won‚Äôt really matter,‚Äù said NBA commissioner Adam Silver, who reasoned that the sheer number of fluff pieces written about the league‚Äôs coronavirus-free post-season should give them free reign to host super-spreader events across the country. ‚ÄúOur legacy is pretty much secured at this point. We already did our part to contain the spread‚Äîa few hundred Covid cases this year won‚Äôt take that away. It‚Äôs probably a good idea to make sure that LeBron or Giannis don‚Äôt catch it, but who gives a shit about the other guys? We don‚Äôt really expect any push back, since we got a free pass for trapping our players in Disney World to recoup lost revenue.‚Äù At press time, Silver figured that if the NBA didn‚Äôt cancel games after Kobe Bryant‚Äôs death, then they won‚Äôt have to if a player succumbs to coronavirus.

We‚Äôre talking about a once-in-a-generation intern who comes from an elite prep school. Any senator would be happy to add him to their roster, and it‚Äôs unfortunate that someone like Tommy can just buy their way through the process.‚Äù At press time, Tuberville announced plans to suspend the intern for two sessions of Congress for accepting illicit funds.

1127,Grief Psychologists Say Best Way To Cope With Death In The Family Is Dropping 50 In NBA Game,[],"PITTSBURGH, PA‚ÄîUrging suffering individuals to take concrete action to address their lingering pain, grief psychologists from Carnegie Mellon University released a study Tuesday finding that the best way to cope with a death in the family is dropping 50 points in an NBA game. ‚ÄúAccording to our data, the first stage of healing should involve hanging from the rim after a monster dunk and releasing a primal scream,‚Äù said lead researcher Gena Kennedy, conceding that while grappling with death is challenging, going 9-10 from beyond the arc can function as a potent relief valve. ‚ÄúWe strongly urge anyone grieving a loved one to point up to the heavens after a nailing an impossible fadeaway jumper right in a defender‚Äôs face. We‚Äôve also found that scoring the exact age of the deceased can be cathartic‚Äîeven if it means intentionally missing a free throw. Joining an NBA roster and leading them to a 30-point blowout over a division rival has proven emotional benefits.‚Äù The report concluded by recommending mourners win an NBA championship to pay tribute to the deceased .

You talk about all the photos of me with my eyes gouged out that are pinned to the wall with hunting knives as if it‚Äôs a story, fine, but we are unified and taking it week by week.

Start ‚ÄôEm

Chad Henne (QB): Likely to throw for three touchdowns against a weak Jets D after Kansas City subs out Patrick Mahomes in second quarter with 41-0 lead.

La‚ÄôMical Perine (RB): With Le‚ÄôVeon Bell out of the picture, expect the rookie out of Florida to receive 15-20 carries directly into a pile of linemen.

Dez Bryant (WR): Almost certain not to start this week, but just think about how smart and prophetic you‚Äôll look with him in your lineup if he does suit up and play well.

Baker Mayfield (QB): L ikely to rack up big numbers in any league that counts commercial appearances as six points.

Todd Gurley (RB): Start him this week against Carolina. Or don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre an adult who can make your own decisions.

Sit ‚ÄôEm

Ben DiNucci (QB): Look don‚Äôt tell him we said this because we don‚Äôt want to be mean, but we honestly don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to do a very good job this week.

Philadelphia (D/ST): What does it even matter? Adam is 7-0, and getting Christian McCaffrey back from IR any week. You think starting or sitting one of the two defenses you auto-drafted is going to matter?

Tyreek Hill (WR): His speed and fantasy production are the signs of an egotistical showoff and we don‚Äôt want to encourage that behavior.

Daniel Jones (QB): Could be hampered by the Giants‚Äô new offensive strategy of repeatedly running backwards into the endzone for a safety until they secure the first overall pick.

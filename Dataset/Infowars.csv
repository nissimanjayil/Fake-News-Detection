During his testimony, Piton claimed he believed the alleged fraud was so overwhelming that the numbers coming out of Arizona could not possibly be accurate.

“If I was an executive at a publicly traded company, I would never sign that [certification], because I risk jail time and having all my money taken from me in lawsuits. So, to answer your question, I would never, ever, have certified,” Piton told lawmakers.

“I’d rather resign than have certified those results,” he added.

"Et tu, Barr? Attorney General Says DOJ Hasn’t Found Evidence of Fraud That Would “Change Election Outcome”",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

After weeks of silence, Attorney General William Barr has come out stating the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security haven’t seen any evidence of election fraud that would have changed the election outcome.

In a statement to the AP on Tuesday, Barr said the DOJ and DHS haven’t seen fraud on a scale big enough to change the Nov. 3 presidential election.

“To date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election,” Barr said.

Barr claimed that the only mechanism capable of skewing an election would be compromised voting machines, but “so far” haven’t been able to substantiate that.

“There’s been one assertion that would be systemic fraud and that would be the claim that machines were programmed essentially to skew the election results. And the DHS and DOJ have looked into that, and so far, we haven’t seen anything to substantiate that,” Barr said.

Barr then explained that many of the election fraud allegations should be handled in civil lawsuits where “top-down audits” could be conducted, because many of those allegations are not “systemic” and therefore don’t fall under the DOJ’s purview.

From the AP:

He said people were confusing the use of the federal criminal justice system with allegations that should be made in civil lawsuits. He said such a remedy for those complaints would be a top-down audit conducted by state or local officials, not the U.S. Justice Department. “There’s a growing tendency to use the criminal justice system as sort of a default fix-all, and people don’t like something they want the Department of Justice to come in and ‘investigate,’” Barr said. He said first of all there must be a basis to believe there is a crime to investigate. “Most claims of fraud are very particularized to a particular set of circumstances or actors or conduct. They are not systemic allegations. And those have been run down; they are being run down,” Barr said. “Some have been broad and potentially cover a few thousand votes. They have been followed up on.”

Barr’s long-awaited remarks come days after President Trump lambasted the DOJ and FBI for being “missing in action” as many instances of election fraud evidence, backed by affidavits, are being revealed by the day.

“You would think if you’re in the FBI or Department of Justice, this is the biggest thing you could be looking at,” Trump said Sunday. “Where are they? I’ve not seen anything.”

So far, Trump’s legal team has spearheaded bombshell hearings in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Michigan outlining stunning instances of voter irregularities.

Trump’s legal team responded to Barr’s remarks, arguing there hasn’t even been a “semblance” of a DOJ investigation into the many allegations by poll workers and IT experts they’ve brought forward.

“With all due respect to the Attorney General, there hasn’t been any semblance of a Department of Justice investigation. We have gathered ample evidence of illegal voting in at least six states, which they have not examined. We have many witnesses swearing under oath they saw crimes being committed in connection with voter fraud. As far as we know, not a single one has been interviewed by the DOJ. The Justice Department also hasn’t audited any voting machines or used their subpoena powers to determine the truth,” Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said in a statement.

AG William Barr tells AP Justice Department has 'not seen fraud on a scale that could have affected a different outcome in the election.' https://t.co/B7QHytWKlj Trump legal team responds: pic.twitter.com/vjRCbeaRg8 — Byron York (@ByronYork) December 1, 2020

“Nonetheless, we will continue our pursuit of the truth through the judicial system and state legislatures, and continue toward the Constitution’s mandate and ensuring that every legal vote is counted and every illegal vote is not. Again, with the greatest respect to the Attorney General, his opinion appears to be without any knowledge or investigation of the substantial irregularities and evidence of systemic fraud.”

And there’s plenty of evidence of election fraud for the DOJ to look into outside the local and state level.

As Infowars reported, SEC filings have revealed that that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

Maybe that bit of alarming information is more appropriate for Barr’s DOJ to look into.

Firm That Owns Dominion Voting Systems Received $400 Million From Swiss Bank Account Funded by Communist Chinese Gov & Companies Before Election,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

An investigation into SEC filings has revealed that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

The investigation centers on Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.

Dominion Voting Systems operates voting machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election night.

“On Oct 8, 2020, Staple Street Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400,000,000 with the Sales Compensation Recipient identified as UBS Securities,” states the investigation, which also notes that another payment of $200,000,000 was received in December 2014.

“UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co LTD, a Chinese Investment Bank. The remaining 75% of UBS Securities CO LTD is owned by the Chinese government,” states the report.

The overall owners of UBS Securities Co LTD are;

– Beijing Guoxiang (33%)

– UBS (24.99%)

– Guangdong Comm. Group [zh] (14.01%)

– China Guodian (14%)

– COFCO Group (14%)

Aside from UBS, the other four owners of UBS Securities are all Communist Chinese front groups.

Beijing Guoxiang is a state owned asset.

Guangdong Comm. Group 100% stakeholder is the Guangdong Provincial Government.

China Guodian is state owned enterprise administered for the SASAC for the state Council

COFCO Group is a state owned enterprise under the direct supervision of the SASAC.

SASAC The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) is a special commission of the People’s Republic of China, directly under the State Council.

The revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election to help Joe Biden.

Other connections between Dominion Voting Systems and the Chinese government have also emerged in recent weeks, including the company’s Core Infrastructure Manager of Information Technology, Andy Huang, who previously worked for China Telecom, which is “wholly run by the Chinese government,” reported the National Pulse.

Kapoor responded to the controversy on Monday by retweeting a clip of the episode along with two laughing emojis.

Speaking to Huffpost.com, Kapoor dismissed allegations he was commissioned to spread a message, but said the controversy works to his advantage in terms of exposure.

More from HuffPost.com:

“It was a fraction in time and yet it has become an integral part of my identity as an immigrant in America,” he shared via email, referencing his immigration from India in 2014. He also added that ever since COVID-19 came into the zeitgeist, “people have been reaching out calling me an imposter who was ‘paid’ by the government to spread a message.”

He says he finds humor “in such claims,” a feeling he echoed on Twitter with his crying-laughing emoji in response to the TikTok of his design.

Kapoor, who will be launching his very first collection in February 2021, also told HuffPost that it’s been “very interesting to see how fate plays itself out” and truly “had no idea that the mask thing would blow up.”

“At the end of the day whatever gets people talking about you or your work is worth it,” he said.

The man in the selfie, Dr. Jacob Keeperman, claimed he was at the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit at Renown Medical Center in Reno where he had witnessed 5 deaths “in the last 32 hours.”

Another doctor told local media that they put more beds in the parking garage in case they hit capacity.

“If we continue to have an uptick of COVID-19 patients, we’re going to run out of hospital beds and people to take care of sick people,” said Dr. Deborah Kuhls.

Akron, OH: Today, Tom Zawistowski, President of the TEA Party affiliated We the People Convention (WTPC) and Executive Director of the Portage County TEA Party, published a full page ad in the Washington Times newspaper demanding that President Trump Invoke limited Martial law in order to allow the U.S. Military to oversee a new free and fair federal election if Legislators, Courts and the Congress do not follow the Constitution.

Zawistowski said, “We wanted to express our concerns to the President, to the legislators, courts and Congress that We the People will NOT cede our exclusive Constitutional right to elect our Representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, Governors, Secretary’s of State, Congress, corrupt election officials and local politicians, the corrupt media – or Leftist threats of violence!

Without full confidence that our courts or Congress will indeed follow the 12th Amendment of the Constitution and defend our electoral process, the ad calls upon President Trump, like Lincoln, to exercise the Extraordinary Powers of his office and declare limited Martial Law to temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections in order to have the military implement a national re-vote that reflects the true will of the people.

Here is the full text of the Ad:

Exercising Extraordinary Authority in Defense of Our Vote

May be Required because Martial Law is better than Civil War!

In the months following the start of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln struggled to preserve the Union. Many objected to Lincoln’s extraordinary use of Presidential authority, in particular his suspension of the right of “Habeas Corpus”. On June 12, 1863 Lincoln defended his extreme measures in a letter published in the New York Times. Citing Article I of the Constitution he argued: “Ours is a case of rebellion…in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion; and the provision of the Constitution that ‘the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of rebellion or invasion, the public safety may require it’, is the provision which specifically applies to our present case.” Lincoln used the same reasoning in justifying a series of extraordinary Presidential Orders:

Lincoln ordered hundreds of Northern newspapers that spoke against him to be shut down and their owners and editors arrested.

Lincoln ordered the arrest of Ohio Congressman Clement Vallandigham for the crime of speaking out against him.

Chief Justice of the US Roger Taney ruled that Lincoln had violated the US Constitution when he illegally suspended the Writ of Habeas Corpus. After hearing this Lincoln signed an arrest warrant to have the Chief Justice of the U.S. arrested.

Lincoln ordered the arrest of thousands in Maryland for the crime of “suspected Southern sympathies” including ordering the arrest of US Congressman Henry May from Maryland. These people were arrested and held in military prisons, without trial, some of them for years.

While some debate these measures still today, no one disagrees that Lincoln and his use of Presidential power were responsible for saving the Republic. While History, and even former President Obama, has judged Lincoln as perhaps our greatest President, few would have agreed at the time he took those actions. Then, as now, a President with courage and determination was needed to preserve the Union. Today, the current threat to our United States by the international and domestic socialist/communist left is much more serious than anything Lincoln or our nation has faced in its history – including the civil war.

We have well-funded, armed and trained marxists in ANTIFA and BLM strategically positioned in our major cities acting openly with violence to silence opposition to their anti-American agenda. Attacking federal buildings and police, cowardly punching innocent people in the back of the head, assaulting people just eating in restaurants, and burning minority-owned businesses to the ground. All with elected officials in Democrat/Socialist-controlled cities openly encouraging this planned violence against civilians and businesses. Then, to advance their cause, these socialists are acting to “Defund the Police,” creating chaos and suspending the rule of law that protects millions of average, and particularly minority, Americans. The results being massive increases in violent crime and deaths in our cities and the destruction of small businesses orchestrated by those politicians and leftist groups, many funded by domestic and international communists. We are literally under attack from within!

Then there are admitted Democrat/Socialist federal officials plotting to finish gutting the US Constitution after 100 years of trying. They promise to take away critical individual rights like free speech, religious freedom and the 2nd Amendment; destroy states rights by eliminating the electoral college and more; pack the Supreme Court with activist anti-constitutionalist judges who will make law from the bench; give the right to vote to tens of millions of non-Americans; and open our borders to more illegals which will reduce wages. No one voted for these things that were hidden from the majority of Americans by the corrupt media. Not only do we have corrupt media, like in Lincoln’s day, we have a new and more sinister form of media in Big Tech, actively censoring free speech and promoting leftist propaganda to blind our citizens to their real goals and the real consequences of their actions – the end of America as we have known it.

The Socialist Left has been openly working to destroy the United States since Obama promised and tried to “transform” America in 2008-16, and having been stopped by the will of the American people, they openly staged a four year long coup attempt to remove the duly elected President. Culminating in this corrupt and provably fraudulent current election planned to illegally and un-constitutionally deny the American people their most sacred honor, right and privilege – which is the right to elect their Representatives! How can we have a Representative Republic if we cannot hold fair elections to elect our Representatives? There is no doubt that this attempted stealing of these elections again “is a case of rebellion…in fact, a clear, flagrant, and gigantic case of rebellion” that requires exercising extraordinary authority to preserve our Union.

President Trump, you and every other official in our local, state and federal governments, and everyone in law enforcement and in our military have sworn an oath that says “I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” It is time for everyone who swore that oath to act upon it. The enemies are within our gates and our Constitution and Nation are in real risk of being lost to this socialist/communist invasion unless you act decisively.

At least half of all Americans do not and will not accept this fraudulent election because of the eyewitness testimony, and the material, statistical and mathematical evidence of OVERWHELMING fraud. The other half will not accept the outcome if the courts see the evidence of fraud and rightfully overturn the election! The Left has literally been planning riots just for that occasion for months. We the People must not and WILL NOT cede our exclusive Constitutional right to elect our Representatives to judges, lawyers, courts, Governors, Secretary’s of State, Congress, corrupt election officials and local politicians, the corrupt media – or Leftist threats of violence! It is OUR EXCLUSIVE RIGHT to decide our Representatives not theirs! Therefore, We the People MUST demand a NEW and fair national vote, a vote that all Americans can trust and live by regardless of the winner! Without a fair vote, we fear, with good reason, the threat of a shooting civil war is imminent. Gun sales are at an all time high and 40% are first time gun owners looking to defend themselves, their property, and their rights. Therefore, Mr. President you must act now before there is no peaceful way left to preserve our Union.

When the legislators, courts and/or Congress fail to do their duty under the 12th Amendment, you must be ready Mr. President to immediately declare a limited form of Martial Law, and temporarily suspend the Constitution and civilian control of these federal elections, for the sole purpose of having the military oversee a national re-vote. A vote that assures a fair election in every jurisdiction and reflects the true will of the people. Federal candidates only. Paper ballots. No computers. Hand-counted with both parties watching every vote. Only registered voters. Photo ID to prove residence. Conducted safely with everyone wearing masks and six feet apart, just like we did in Ohio. Only then can the winning candidate be accepted as legitimate by a true majority of We the People who must give our consent to be justly governed! Unfortunately we are at a point where we can only trust our military to do this because our corrupt political class and courts have proven their inability to act fairly and within the law.

You must also act, like Lincoln did, to silence the destructive media’s one-sided propaganda designed and proven to influence the election outcome, and end the unlawful censorship of Big Tech, to restore the confidence of the American People in our electoral process or we cannot continue as a nation. Failure to do so could result in massive violence and destruction on a level not seen since the Civil War. Limited Martial Law is clearly a better option than Civil War!

Many will object to these actions, as they did in Lincoln’s day, but we assure you that We the People understand that no less action will suffice to prevent the loss of our Constitutional right to vote and preserve our Republic. It is time to honor your oath, Mr. President. It is time for you to boldly act to save our nation as Lincoln did. We the People will support a national re-vote. We will also have no other choice but to take matters into our own hands, and defend our rights on our own, if you do not act within your powers to defend us.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The OECD has revealed that China is set to enjoy a post-COVID economic recovery that outstrips every other major country, most of which will see debilitating drops in their GDP.

“A graph proposing GDP projections for various nations and areas showed that China was the only nation on the list to enjoy real GDP growth in 2020, with 1.8%, 8% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022,” reports Sputnik.

“In comparison, the United States, having suffered a 3.7% drop in 2020, is set to achieve 3.2% and 3.5% real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 respectively.”

“The United Kingdom, compared to most countries on the Outlook’s graph, got affected more heavily suffering a GDP reduction of 11.2% in 2020, with only Argentina showing worse results – 12.9% drop.”

While small businesses continue to go bust and see their profits dwindle, Amazon and other massive transnational corporations have joined China in coming out of the pandemic on a strong economic footing.

Amazon has seen its profits during the COVID pandemic soar by 100% while small businesses on average have lost 30% in profits and 21% have closed down permanently.

The CEO’s of these companies have also seen their personal wealth increase by tens of billions while small businesses have lost over $200 billion.

As we previously highlighted, while the United States and Europe continue to subject their citizens to crippling lockdowns, people in China where the virus originated are enjoying massive pool parties and nightclubs where there is no social distancing or mask wearing.

Some have suggested that videos which emerged out of China in the early days of the pandemic which showed people convulsing and dropping dead on the streets were part of a propaganda ploy to convince other countries that coronavirus was immeasurably worse than it turned out to be.

This overreaction continues to this day, with discussions in the UK of a third lockdown now taking place despite the fact that hospitals are not overwhelmed and the yearly average death statistics are no different from usual.

“A graph proposing GDP projections for various nations and areas showed that China was the only nation on the list to enjoy real GDP growth in 2020, with 1.8%, 8% in 2021 and 4.9% in 2022,” reports Sputnik.

“In comparison, the United States, having suffered a 3.7% drop in 2020, is set to achieve 3.2% and 3.5% real GDP growth in 2021 and 2022 respectively.”

“The United Kingdom, compared to most countries on the Outlook’s graph, got affected more heavily suffering a GDP reduction of 11.2% in 2020, with only Argentina showing worse results – 12.9% drop.”

While small businesses continue to go bust and see their profits dwindle, Amazon and other massive transnational corporations have joined China in coming out of the pandemic on a strong economic footing.

Amazon has seen its profits during the COVID pandemic soar by 100% while small businesses on average have lost 30% in profits and 21% have closed down permanently.

The CEO’s of these companies have also seen their personal wealth increase by tens of billions while small businesses have lost over $200 billion.

As we previously highlighted, while the United States and Europe continue to subject their citizens to crippling lockdowns, people in China where the virus originated are enjoying massive pool parties and nightclubs where there is no social distancing or mask wearing.

Some have suggested that videos which emerged out of China in the early days of the pandemic which showed people convulsing and dropping dead on the streets were part of a propaganda ploy to convince other countries that coronavirus was immeasurably worse than it turned out to be.

This overreaction continues to this day, with discussions in the UK of a third lockdown now taking place despite the fact that hospitals are not overwhelmed and the yearly average death statistics are no different from usual.

17 Million Americans Behind on Mortgage or Rent Payments,[],"Even as market mania continues over hopes for a coronavirus vaccine, the economic devastation caused by the government response to the pandemic continues to ravage the economy.

Seventeen million households are behind on rent or mortgage payments, and nearly 6 million Americans say they are at risk of eviction in the next few months.

According to a survey by the US Census Bureau, roughly 5.8 million adults say they are somewhat to very likely to face eviction or foreclosure in the next two months.

A CARES Act program allowing homeowners to pause mortgage payments for up to a year is set to expire. Some homeowners in the program could face foreclosure as early as March. Meanwhile, the CDC’s nationwide suspension on evictions will expire on Dec. 31. Millions of Americans are also set to lose unemployment benefits at year-end unless Congress passes an extension.

The employment situation has also been deteriorating. Weekly unemployment claims set a record in March and have yet to fall below the previous record set during the Great Recession. Weekly jobless claims have risen each of the past three weeks.

And the employment picture doesn’t show any hope of improvement, with nearly 1-in-10 companies are planning layoffs in the next three months. That’s on top of the more than a quarter of US companies that have already let workers go in Q4.

There is also the looming prospect of more corporate bankruptcies and business closures, putting more pressure on the jobs market. More than 420,000 small businesses have closed their doors permanently since the beginning of the pandemic. That represents a staggering 7.1% of all small businesses. Brookings estimates that the US economy has lost some 4 million jobs in the small business sector “that will only return with the creation of new businesses.” On top of all this, Goldman Sachs projects even more permanent job losses coming down the pike as a wave of mergers, acquisitions and corporate takeovers sweeps through the economy.

This underscores the fact that despite optimism about a vaccine, nothing has fundamentally changed in the economy. And even if they cure COVID, it won’t instantaneously fix the economy. As Peter Schiff has put it, there is no vaccine for what ails the economy.

The US government will almost certainly pass a massive stimulus bill to prop up the economy a while longer. That means more debt and more Federal Reserve money printing. But as Peter has been saying, this so-called COVID cure is what’s making the economy sick.

The real burden is not the COVID, but all the debt the economy accumulated while the Fed was trying to fight COVID. It’s the COVID cure that is far more harmful to the economy than the disease. So, even after the disease is gone, the cure is going to linger and is going to continue to do damage because we accumulated all this extra debt, because the Fed’s balance sheet is now so much bigger, because the stock market bubble is so much bigger, because the real estate bubble has gained new strength, because everybody has more leverage than they did before. And of course, the US economy is going to be less efficient in this post-COVID world as US companies are still going to have to be covering the costs of being able to prepare for the next lockdown or the next virus that comes up. We already know what the playbook is.”

Why Marx Never Figured Out How to Distribute Goods in a Socialist Society,[],"Contra Marx, Mises understood that human desires and needs are not determined merely by biology.

Karl Marx held that human interests are “uniquely and entirely determined by the biological nature of the human body.”1 He thought that people were exclusively interested in gaining as many tangible goods as they could. Therefore, a person’s wants would not depend on his ideas but on his physiological condition. More is better.

The question Ludwig von Mises posed, on the other hand, is: More of what?

Economics is concerned with how this is decided. It is one thing to say that under socialism men enjoy their toil because they will find self-actualization in producing goods for each other. It is another thing entirely to demonstrate who, under socialism, will choose what is made for whom, how, where, with what, and by whom.

The basic economic problem, as it is sometimes called by economists, is that resources are scarce but human wants are unlimited. While primitive men faced with starvation (and animals) may well only be interested in the quantity of food the can secure, as soon as civilization reaches its early stages people are faced with the problem of choosing which one of their various competing desires they should satisfy. Given there are various ways of satisfying the same needs, they also have to answer the question of how they should satisfy them.

Mises defines human action itself as the employment of scarce means for the attainment of preferred ends. To act is to choose between two or more things that we cannot have both of, preferring one and setting aside the other.2

Under capitalism different business owners attempt to make competing products in all different ways, and the consumer will ultimately decide which of them get rich and which go out of business. Each of us, as customers, apply our scarce means, setting aside some products to buy others, and in doing so we decide what is produced and by whom. How is the same going to be determined efficiently in a moneyless society where wage labor has been abolished, such as Marx envisaged?

We Act Based on Our Idea of What Is Best for Us

Ultimately, some authority must decide. This is unsatisfactory to Mises. For him, a free man gets to decide himself how he spends his income, but in a society where an authority supplies those things they think the people need—or ought to have—men are not free. Marxism does not differentiate between these two modes of want satisfaction and therefore does not apprehend the difference between freedom and slavery. The Marxian image of freedom looks more like this: “If a man who wants to get the bible gets the Koran instead, he is no longer free.”3

To Mises, people can only determine for themselves their own interests, and the authority cannot give the people what they choose according to their own values, but only according to what the authority thinks their values ought to be. If the “paltry” individual disagrees, so much the worse for him. Mises writes: “One does not serve the interests of a man who wants a new coat by giving him a pair of shoes or those of a man who wants to hear a Beethoven symphony by giving him admission to a boxing match. It is ideas that are responsible for the fact that the interests of people are disparate.”4

This remains an issue of contention to this day. Should the consumer decide what kind of healthcare they receive, or is it better if the government decides on their behalf and supplies it to them as a public service? While socialized healthcare is a popular idea, those who can afford private services usually avail themselves of the best they can buy. This reveals that most people accept that the private sector does a better job of providing healthcare than the state. Those who cannot afford private care in countries with socialized medicine have to accept whatever they are given. They cannot push administrators to improve the quality of services by threatening to “take their business elsewhere.” Similarly, politicians are sometimes the subject of scandals when the media unearths the fact they sent their children to a private school. It is roundly taken as an admission that they don’t believe the services provided by government are good enough for their own children but are willing to impose them upon their constituents.

Mises says that even if we granted, for the sake of argument, that there was no uncertainty concerning what people wanted or how it should be produced, there would still remain the question of weighing people’s short-term interests against their long-term ones. Everyone has to evaluate for himself how much he values the health that comes from strict exercise and diet, for example, against the enjoyment of leisure and tasty snacks. This depends on one’s own, individual ideas and subjective evaluations.

The same applies on a larger scale for production in society. Should we save more so that more can be invested in machines and technology that will make society wealthier in the long term, or should we enjoy increased material standards of living in the here and now? There is no correct, objective answer to such a question. A subjective evaluation has to be made by someone or some people. Under capitalism individuals make their own decisions as to how much to consume and how much to save, and the aggregatation of those individual decisions forms the final answer. Under socialism—who knows? Usually it is left to a government department to guess and impose their will upon the people. Invariably this leads to mass overproduction of certain commodities and underproduction of others. Sadly too often it has led to famine: in the Soviet Union from 1921–22 and 1946–47, as well as in the Ukraine (1932–34), China (1958–62), Cambodia (1979), Ethiopia (1983–85), and in North Korea (1995–99). To Mises these famines were not chance occurrences that could have happened under any system. They were a direct result of the fact that under socialism central planners have no reliable means of calculating what to produce or how to produce it, and were completely predictable by economic theory.5

Marx does not attempt to solve this problem. Perhaps he never even considered that it might actually be a problem. He simply claimed that socialism, as the next stage in history, would be an earthly paradise in which questions such as these would settle themselves and everyone would get all they needed. The Land of Cockaigne, as Mises likes to refer to it.

How to Achieve the Socialist Paradise?

Of course, if this were true, then no one could deny that socialism was in everyone’s interests. Who could oppose it? The problem begins when any discussion of how they will get what they need is dismissed as “unscientific.” This may well be why all attempts at communism have so far not only failed but resulted in death and misery for countless victims. The primary reason these regimes fail is not merely because their leaders were evil, although they may have been, or because America intervened to undermine the regime—as it certainly did, for example, in Nicaragua, Venezuela, Cambodia, East Timor, and many other places. The fundamental reason was because of a failure to organize production.

In a hypothetical paradise people would no longer need any ideas. They wouldn’t have to make judgments and evaluate which course of action is likely to secure their needs. All would be given. However, in reality, ideas determine what people consider to be their interests. A person’s interests cannot be independent of their ideas. It is ideas that determine what people consider their interests to be. You can say it is in my interests to eat well, but that’s only if I want to live and be healthy. If I choose to die, or am already dying and want to eat chocolate cake until I finally pop off, then who can dispute my evaluation of my interests? Free men do not act in accordance with their interests, because what their interests are are an arbitrary questions of judgment. We act invariably upon what we believe our interests to be.",InfoWars,-1
Why Central Bank Digital Currencies Are a Bad Idea,[],"Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are being sold with the narrative of protecting consumers who are increasingly moving to cashless payments.

Some say that these cashless payments will rob us of the privacy advantages of cash while exposing us to bank runs, payment network blackouts, and foreign financial adversaries.

Yet while these risks are real, they would be negligible had it not been for the central banking and financial regulators’ interventions into the market. CBDCs make these interventions worse and introduce some new, much bigger ones.

Design Implications

While the stated intention behind CBDCs is to keep the commercial banks in the picture, these digital currencies will bring their end users closer to the central banks. This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single common ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and, e.g., change the inflation rate.

A permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn’t provide the immutability feature, but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than it has right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.

Helicopter Money

The reason why we’ve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable, and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.

Economists of the Austrian school understand that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo-)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.

The problem is that the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy that hasn’t fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn’t brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels. Needless to say, commercial banks’ cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn’t align well with the central bank’s goals either. During the covid crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation. Since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn’t—capital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers.

With closer integration of the monetary spigot and the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit or just outright cash-outs to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply “airdropping” new tokens to the existing users. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture—they would still serve as custodians of the token keys and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.

This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks’ dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists have had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure. And while monetary overdoses such as we’ve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don’t perform well, as Japan’s three lost decades of Bank of Japan (BOJ) interventions have demonstrated.

Negative Interest Rates

Hoarding is evil—or so the modern monetarists’ narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings are just money that doesn’t work in spurring the miracles of spending- and money supply–driven economic growth. Negative interest rates, then, are potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding—by incentivizing savings account holders to spend their depreciating balances. Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on to their customers, but commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative-yielding accounts to interest-yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.

With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly to their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would certainly increase the consumers’ and businesses’ propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people tried to offload their cash savings. But to think of this as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe will lead to a different, let alone better, outcome is ludicrous.

Financial Surveillance

The final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people’s privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that a branch of government that imposes KYC/AML rules on existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch nonviolent “criminals” cares about our privacy is laughable.

They’re not even hiding the fact that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call “data analytics.” To think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be naïve.

It’s not a coincidence that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to a government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.

Pro-CBDC Arguments Are Misleading

The proponents of the central banking tokens argue that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country’s payment network. While such a risk exists—for example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors (as it used to) and as a result Visa and Mastercard were pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country—if it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.

If anything, the biggest attacks on monetary exchange in the Western world have come from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises, as was the case in Cyprus or Greece (not to mention that central banks themselves caused those crises with their credit bubbles of the preceding periods).

The argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn’t pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.

CBDCs Will Come and Will Make Things Worse

In conclusion, the reasons why central banks champion CBDCs are the strongest reasons for which people should oppose the transition toward them. But while the pretense of an investigation into fiat money tokenization gives the impression of there being a debate on the topic, the reality is that there is no debate: the digital currencies will go through and give central banks more control than they had before with all the disastrous consequences such control brings.",InfoWars,-1
America’s Pride In The Economy Is About To Be Greatly Shaken As Tens Of Millions Face Eviction In 2021,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Unless there is emergency intervention, tens of millions of Americans could be facing eviction once the holiday season is over.

We kicked the can down the road throughout 2020, but all of the rent that was originally owed to landlords all over the country is still due, and they are very eager to collect.

Countless landlords are on the verge of financial ruin because of the rent moratoriums which were put in place, and kicking the can down the road even more would be absolutely disastrous for them.

Of course it would also be absolutely disastrous if the moratoriums are not extended, because in some states more than half of all households are behind on their rent or mortgage payments, and most of them have no way to pay.

Can you imagine who counter to reality our lives would be if someone who can’t even identify her own gender is responsible for the terms we define medicine by?

One way or the other, we are about to hit a breaking point. The Aspen Institute is telling us that a whopping 40 million people “could face eviction over the next several months”…

According to research by the Aspen Institute, nearly 40 million Americans could face eviction over the next several months. The only thing holding back the flood right now is the CDC’s eviction moratorium order and a patchwork of state and local protections for renters. But these moratoriums are only kicking the can down the road. Chief economist for Moody’s Analytics Mark Zandi told the Washington Post that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year’s end. And for landlords left holding the bag, there’s been little relief, as they’ve been forced to take on the role of government — subsidizing housing for millions even as their own taxes, mortgage payments, and other expenses are due.

That is about 12 percent of the entire country.

If they get evicted, where are they going to go?

Into the streets?

Vox recently interviewed a 48-year-old Texas resident named “Kimberly”, and she says that is exactly where she is headed if she gets evicted…

But after Covid-19 hit, she lost hours at her job as a crew trainer at Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers and found herself on the brink of financial collapse. She fell behind on her rent and when she tried to work with her landlord to set up a repayment plan, she told Vox that she was served an eviction notice. Now, the only thing keeping her in her home is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) national eviction moratorium, which prohibits landlords from evicting qualifying tenants for failing to make rent. If she’s evicted, Kimberly says she has nowhere to go — and will be homeless for the second time in five years.

And there are countless others out there that are just like her.

According to Zero Hedge, “at least half of households in Arkansas, Florida and Nevada are not current on rent and mortgage payments”.

We have never seen anything like this in modern American history, and the new lockdowns that are being instituted across the nation will just make things even worse.

Of course there are many Americans that will be able to move in with family, and this has already been happening in very large numbers. In particular, young people are moving back in with their parents on a massive scale. According to the Pew Research Center, “a majority of young adults in the U.S. live with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression”.

The phrase “since the Great Depression” has been popping up a lot lately, hasn’t it?

That is because this is literally the first economic depression that the U.S. has experienced since that time.

Everywhere we look, we can see the sort of economic devastation that I have been warning was coming for a very long time.

In New Jersey, approximately one-third of all small businesses “have closed down in 2020”…

A third of small businesses in New Jersey have closed down in 2020, according to a report from The Star-Ledger newspaper. “It’s really bad… And without federal dollars coming into New Jersey, the Main Street stores and other establishments are not gonna make it through the winter.” said Eileen Kean, the state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.

New Jersey’s number is higher than the national average, but not by very much.

Of course Atlantic City has been hit particularly hard because it is so dependent on tourism. At this point, it is being called “the city without a pulse”…

The boardwalk is empty, the beaches are deserted, and the casinos, though partially reopen, are limping into their fifth month of severely curtailed operations after four months of shutdowns. The coronavirus pandemic skewered the economic engine of this beachside town, taking the city’s vibrancy and its residents’ livelihoods out with it.

Sadly, things are inevitably going to get worse in the months ahead thanks to the new lockdowns. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has risen significantly for the past two weeks, and more bad weeks are almost certainly ahead.

Needless to say, rising unemployment will mean more Americans being pushed out of their homes and more Americans being pushed into poverty. According to a survey that was released in October, the number of Americans living in poverty has risen by 8 million since May…

The number of Americans living in poverty grew by 8 million since May, according to a Columbia University study, which found an increase in poverty rates after early coronavirus relief ended without more to follow. Although the federal Cares Act, which gave Americans a one-time stimulus check of $1,200 and unemployed workers an extra $600 each week, was successful at offsetting growing poverty rates in the spring, the effects were short-lived, researchers found in the study published Thursday.

Of course that number is more than a month old, and so the true number of Americans that have been forced into poverty is substantially higher by now.

This is what an economic collapse looks like, and even worse days are ahead of us.

The good news is that those that were warned in advance that an economic collapse was coming had time to make preparations for this sort of a scenario.

But most Americans never wanted to listen to the warnings, and so now they find themselves in the middle of a storm without an umbrella.

Unfortunately, what we have experienced so far is just the leading edge of the storm, and most people still do not realize that.",InfoWars,-1

Alcohol BANNED in Welsh pubs & bars as new social distancing measures announced,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Pubs, bars, and restaurants in Wales will be banned from selling alcoholic drinks, and they will have to close by 6pm or switch to doing takeaway, according to the new set of rules unveiled for the hospitality industry.

Other entertainment venues, such as cinemas, bowling alleys, and skating rinks, will have to close outright.

The measures, announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford, will come into force from 6pm this Friday.

“I recognise just how hard the hospitality and leisure sectors have worked to comply with the regulations,” Drakeford said in a press conference, admitting the new rules’ harshness. “I know the new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at one of the busiest times of the year,” he added.

Anticipating backlash from business owners, workers, and customers, the first minister pleaded with the Welsh to consider the supposed severity of the pandemic. “We continue to face a virus that is moving incredibly quickly across Wales, and it is a virus that will exploit every opportunity when we spend time with one another,” he said.

However, Drakeford did not seem to find much support, as the new anti-coronavirus measures, coming just three weeks after he firebreak lockdown in Wales ended, were relentlessly attacked online. Commenters accused the Welsh government of “strangling parts of its economy,” and compared the country to North Korea. “Welcome to your new Prohibition era,” tweeted one person.

Drug Company Counter-Sues COVID Vaccine Trial Volunteer for ‘Malicious’ Claim Injection Led to Health Issues,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has gone on the offensive after a participant in its coronavirus vaccine trial sued the firm, alleging he suffered serious side effects from the jab.

In a countersuit, SII has demanded Rs 100 crore ($13.5 million USD) from the volunteer for his “malicious and misconceived” allegation that Covishield, a version of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University Covid-19 jab, led to a medical episode.

In a statement, the company said it was “sympathetic with the volunteer’s medical condition” but that there is “absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer.” The Pune-based drug manufacturer stressed that the volunteer was “specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent,” but the individual “still chose to go public and malign the reputation” of SII.

The volunteer, a 40-year-old man from Chennai, claims he suffered severe neurological damage after taking part in the phase three trial of Covishield. He sued SII for Rs 5 crore ($676,000 USD) and demanded SII, AstraZeneca and the Oxford Vaccine Group immediately halt vaccine trials, involving some 1,600 volunteers.

The man reportedly suffered from headaches and vomiting ten days after receiving the jab. He was taken to the hospital after displaying abnormal behavior.

The trial participant was later discharged at his own request. Hospital documents stated he was recovering from “acute encephalopathy,” was suffering from vitamin deficiencies and was suspected of having a “connective tissue disorder.”

A medical official cited by local media said that the man was “now alright” and did not incur any expenses for his time in the emergency ward. The man’s wife claims he has not fully recovered.

In September, SII halted its clinical trials of Covishield after a recipient of the AstraZeneca jab experienced adverse symptoms.

Commenting on the findings, the director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education based at the University of Birmingham, Professor Kalwant Bhopal told The Guardian that it shows white people “feel their privilege is being threatened and questioned”.

This is a bizarre comment to make, given that a sizeable portion of non-white people agree with the sentiment that BLM has worsened race relations.

“When they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it [their white privilege] and there is a backlash,” Bhopal added, displaying severe cognitive dissonance.

Major scientists in the medical and pharmaceutical community are coming out now in denial of the hoax, and Alex Jones is here to listen to them.

The British government is, once again, out of step with the public on this issue, given that at the height of a national lockdown it allowed BLM protests to go ahead unimpeded, and even consented to statues of historical figures, including Winston Churchill, as well as war memorials being covered by boxes at the best of the BLM mob.

“Sidney and the President through, I believe, General Flynn, have got the ‘Kraken’ organization, the 305 Military Intelligence Battalion, working with them,” said McInerney. “Because in all of this, we have not seen any footprints of the DOJ, of the FBI, nor the CIA on the friendly side. It’s been on the ‘Deep State’ side.”

WOW.



Listen to General McInerney describe the Kraken and the raid of the CIA facility in Frankfurt, Germany.

“Special Operations Forces seized those, that facility, so they have those servers” said McInerney. McInerney added that the raid did not go “without incident” and stated that U.S. soldiers faced casualties during the operation:

Voting machines are being wiped as per Georgia judge and no one is aware of the blatant discarding of the rights of We The People.

“My initial report is that U.S. soldiers were killed in that operation. Now, that was a CIA operation, so that’s the very worrisome thing. Did that occur because of what Mary and I, and Allen, were notifying on Sunday and the Monday in different networks, that this was going to happen, that they were using Hammer and Scorecard…”

National File was able to quickly verify that Powell quoted a former member of the 305th in the lawsuit, which declared that “a former electronic intelligence analyst under the 305th Military Intelligence with experience gathering SAM missile system electronic intelligence” told her that “the Dominion software was accessed by agents acting on behalf of China and Iran” to manipulate the election.

When WVW-TV’s Brannon Howse pushed, “But you are saying that it was a CIA facility, and that was where the server was taken from, by these special forces, was a CIA facility in Germany?” McInerney responded saying, “Yes. That’s correct. Frankfurt, Germany.”

He continues to explain how various elements of the U.S. government, such as the “Deep State”, the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary, are involved in “this coup d’etat.”

“This is treason. Benedict Arnold gave away West Point, or tried to, in the Revolutionary War. We haven’t seen treason to this magnitude ever in our history” said McInerney.

McInerney elaborates further by stating that President Donald Trump must not leave the Oval Office until the American people have “had a full disclosure of what’s going on.”

“What you’re saying is that President Trump needs to fulfill his oath that he took to defend America against enemies both foreign and domestic, and he must not let deadlines stop him from fulfilling that oath. Is that what I hear you say?” Howse asked.

McInerney responded by saying “That is exactly what you heard me say Brannon.”

The general claimed to be confident that widespread voter fraud will be revealed upon the inspection of the Dominion servers seized in Germany.

“We can’t have this absolute disregard for the laws of the land and by judges, and by legislatures. They must get hold of this.” McInerney added, “There is a path, but I believe they’re going to, the Democrats, are going to think ‘this is politics’ and they’re going to try to shut that down.”

“Well if they do, then, the American people must demand that the President stay in office until this is cleared up, because it’s treason. It’s a coup d’etat against the government of the United States and we cannot accept that.”

Keep up to date with our latest:

Violent clashes and arson have erupted in Paris amid mass protests against police brutality and a draft law that would ban filming officers “in certain circumstances,” after a video emerged of cops beating a black music producer.

Thousands of people rallied against the controversial bill in more than 70 French cities on Saturday, with the organizers claiming over half a million participants and authorities estimating the number at around 150,000. The daytime rallies went off peacefully, but by early evening clashes erupted in multiple cities, including Rennes, Lille, Bordeaux and Lyon.

Paris descended into chaos, forcing police to deploy tear gas, flashbangs and water cannon after black-clad masked protesters launched fireworks and pelted cops with stones.

Alex Jones breaks down the growing push to force injections on the public as growing evidence of horrific reactions continue to surface.

Multiple videos also showed rioters smashing vehicles and shop windows, and torching cars and a motorcycle.

At one point, protesters set the entrance to France’s central bank on fire, while firefighters struggled to reach the scene through the streets blocked by police fencing, makeshift barricades and burning trash.

The meeting, chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday, decided on measures to refine the bad-faith deterrent mechanism to promote the orderly and healthy development of the social credit system.

The principles include adhering to laws and regulations, protecting rights and interests, taking a prudent and appropriate approach and implementing list-based management.

Thousands of Protesters March in France Against Draconian Security Law That Bans Filming Police,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Protesters throughout France have shown up for rallies against a controversial draft law on public safety, under which filming a police officer on duty may result in a hefty fine. Critics say it fosters impunity for misconduct.

The protests were organized in many large French cities, including Paris, Marseilles, Lyon, Brest and Nice, with thousands participating despite Covid-19 concerns. The main event is happening in the Place de la République in the capital.

The demonstrators are voicing their anger over a draft law on public security, which was approved by the lower chamber of the parliament this week. Article 24 of the bill bans filming of police officers on duty with an intention to harm them. Lawmakers who voted for the bill are among the officials who were shamed by the protesters.

The reasoning behind the provision, which introduces a fine of €45,000 ($53,450) or even a one-year jail term, is that members of the force need to be protected from doxxing and online harassment. Critics say it curtails journalistic freedoms and would be used to intimidate people who want to expose police brutality and other forms of misconduct.

The protests were organized by unions, but they have many supporters. The Yellow Vests movement, which was sparked by growing social and economic inequality and for months remained a major problem for President Emmanuel Macron, is among them.

There is also a component of racism in why the proposed law sparked so much anger. Police abuse of people of color became more visible thanks to the spread of mobile phones with good cameras and social media.

Iran announced that Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in Damavand Friday afternoon. Images of the scene show two vehicles, one with extensive fire damage and the other riddled with bullet holes. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif appeared to blame Israel for the nuclear expert’s killing.

“This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,” Brennan wrote of Fakhrizadeh’s death. “Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.”

“These assassinations are far different than strikes against terrorist leaders & operatives of groups like al-Qaida & Islamic State, which are not sovereign states. As illegitimate combatants under international law, they can be targeted in order to stop deadly terrorist attacks,” he concluded.

Owen Shroyer guest hosts The Alex Jones Show to break down how social justice warriors and Covid ruined Thanksgiving 2020.

“It has been brought to my attention recently that there has been some confusion over the face behind @independentblackbusinesses so I wanted to be open and clarify that I, (Helen) am White,” the account stated.

The account also apologized for using non-white emoticons after realizing that “using emoticons that differ to your own skin colour can be a form of digital blackface and digital cultural appropriation.”

When the post first began to receive attention, the top comments showcased feelings of anger and betrayal by black nationalists who had been led to believe that the page was managed by a woke black woman.

“So you’ve had this page for almost six months, you’ve posted over 100 times and you never thought it was important to highlight that you’re a white woman” one comment read, while another stated, “For days, I was speaking openly with you about a difficult issue that was affecting me as a Black person. At no point during our messages did you find an opportunity to say ‘I am actually white and I stand with you’.”

Over the past few days, however, several of those comments have mysteriously disappeared and been replaced with messages of support that have been been liked by the owner of “Independent Black Businesses.”

When the page tried to resume posting its usual content, however, the comments section was flooded with negative messages.

One user noted, “You have responded to many of the supportive and congratulatory comments on your last post but have failed to reply to many of the comments calling your actions into question and asking for accountability.”

Alex Jones breaks down the bombshell admission by a hospital executive that the so-called “second wave” of the China Virus is a total hoax, much like the rest of the pandemic hysteria.

The whistleblower from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which operates a network of 35 hospitals in western Pennsylvania, described how the latest “surge” of Covid cases was overblown by the media.

During this period, he said, hospitalizations increased from 96 beds to 600 beds, where the patients were kept in observation overnight and no deaths resulted.

However, the media will report that there was a 600% increase in hospitalizations to make it seem more dire and to justify another lockdown.

For example, if you start with 5 patients to 25, the media will say there was a 500% increase in cases — sounds terrifying, right?

An academic paper released in April of this year outlines how smart cities and artificial intelligence will be used for “enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks“

Under a Biden Presidency, the long-standing plans of globalists to usher in “Planned-Opolis” cities will be realized.

A recent headline suggested that Biden will move forward with the smart city plan: “The Biden Administration Could Be Good for Smart Cities”:

“In general, Biden’s campaign rhetoric has tended to signal good things for urban tech initiatives. The president-elect has promised to “encourage innovation and launch smarter cities” — with a particular eye on transportation.”

While they are promoted as a futuristic vision of utopia, smart cities around the world utilized smart city technology as “command and control centers” to enforce tyrannical COVID lockdowns. As part of the United Nations Agenda 2030, the world is moving to construct the cities.

In 2008, OTN reported on the testing of smart cities in South Korea. Bill Gates’ Microsoft played a key role in developing the technology.

South Korea was chosen for the test because, in the words of the city’s developers, “There is an historical expectation of less privacy.” The New York Times reported:

“Much of this technology was developed in U.S. research labs, but there are fewer social and regulatory obstacles to implementing them in Korea,” said Mr. Townsend [a research director at the Institute for the Future in Palo Alto, California], who consulted on Seoul’s own U-city plan, known as Digital Media City. “There is an historical expectation of less privacy. Korea is willing to put off the hard questions to take the early lead and set standards.”

An academic paper released in April of this year outlines how smart cities and artificial intelligence will be used for “enforcement of guidelines, rules and government orders to contain such future outbreaks“. The paper concludes that, “The proposed architecture and AI assisted applications… can be used to effectively and timely enforce social distancing community measures, and optimize the use of resources in critical situations.”

China is building “COVID-proof” cities “with future lockdowns in mind“.

India utilized its Varanasi smart city to enforce the COVID lockdown:

“To keep a tight vigil on the movement of people during the lockdown and tab on home-quarantined people infected with covid-19, Varanasi, the PM’s own constituency, is using CCTVs and geographic information system (GIS) technology accessed through its integrated command and control centre (ICCC) set up under the smart city mission.”

When people become desperate enough, those in power can get most of them to do just about anything.

The first wave of lockdowns knocked us into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it sent suicide rates soaring all over the globe, and it plunged millions upon millions of ordinary citizens into a deep state of despair.

Now another wave of lockdowns is being instituted all over the planet, and this is going to perfectly set the stage for the “solutions” that the elite plan to offer all of us in 2021.

It has been said that if you want people to be willing to accept a solution, first you have to make them realize that they have a problem.

And once this “dark winter” finally ends, almost everybody will be absolutely desperate to return to their “normal” lives.

Owen and Enrique Tarrio react to a viral picture of an old man being hugged by a doctor in full hazmat suit during Thanksgiving.

With each passing day, more extremely harsh restrictions are being imposed. For example, a brand new “stay at home order” was just issued in Los Angeles County…

All public and private gatherings with anyone outside a single household are now banned in Los Angeles County, as most of the country grapples with an unprecedented surge of Covid-19. The ban will last three weeks, starting Monday and ending December 20.

It would be nice if the lockdown actually does get lifted before the end of the year, but for at least the next three weeks all 10 million people living in L.A. County will be forced “to stay home as much as possible”…

All 10 million residents are asked to stay home as much as possible and wear face masks when outside — even when exercising at the beach and parks, said the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, which issued the order last week.

On top of that, California Governor Gavin Newsom is warning that he may soon impose “much more dramatic, arguably drastic” restrictions for the entire state…

California Gov Gavin Newsom just warned that more drastic steps could be taken to contain the virus after the state reported another 15k+ new cases yesterday. The Golden State could be facing “much more dramatic, arguably drastic” measures to contain the spread of the virus. The state also broke its record for hospitalized patients yesterday: The state reported 7,415 coronavirus hospitalizations, with more than 1,700 of those patients in ICUs. The number of hospitalizations broke the state’s previous record of 7,170 in July.

Unfortunately, we are witnessing similar craziness all over the nation. In New Mexico, the new restrictions that were just instituted created so much panic that people were soon waiting for hours just to get into a supermarket to shop for food…

New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham (D) has put immense pressure on businesses with her “abrupt” lockdown order – forcing “nonessential” businesses to close and creating what has been dubbed “modern breadlines” — with people waiting 2-4 hours to enter essential retailers, former GOP Senate candidate Elisa Martinez explained during an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday.

After seeing what the first round of lockdowns did to our nation, why would these politicians want to do it again?

More than 70 million Americans have filed unemployment claims so far in 2020, more than 40 million could be facing eviction in 2021, and there has been a dramatic spike in suicides during this pandemic.

When a 90-year-old woman named Nancy Russell found out that another lockdown was happening in her area, she decided to opt for assisted suicide…

According to CTV News, a 90-year-old woman living in Toronto took her own life via medically assisted suicide, the choice made in large part due to the second surge of coronavirus cases and a looming period of increased restrictions.

As I keep reminding my readers, there is always hope if you look at the bigger picture and suicide is never the answer to anything.

Unfortunately, most people are not getting a message of hope from the mainstream media, and Russell decided that the months ahead were going to be too bleak in her nursing home for her to be able to handle…

Residents eat meals in their rooms, have activities and social gatherings cancelled, family visits curtailed or eliminated. Sometimes they are in isolation in their small rooms for days. These measures, aimed at saving lives, can sometimes be detrimental enough to the overall health of residents that they find themselves looking into other options.

Just as we are hitting a low point with this pandemic, authorities all over the globe are announcing that vaccines will soon be available.

In fact, it is being reported that as many as ten different vaccines could be available by the middle of 2021…

Ten COVID-19 vaccines could be available by the middle of next year if they win regulatory approval, but their inventors need patent protection, the head of the global pharmaceutical industry group said on Friday.

As soon as the public can get them, it is inevitable that millions upon millions of people will rush out to get their shots so that they can return to their “normal” lives.

But what they aren’t telling you is that these new vaccines are entirely different from vaccines that you may have gotten previously.

These new mRNA vaccines will actually “hijack” your cells if you take them…

When Moderna was just finishing its Phase I trial, The Independent wrote about the vaccine and described it this way: “It uses a sequence of genetic RNA material produced in a lab that, when injected into your body, must invade your cells and hijack your cells’ protein-making machinery called ribosomes to produce the viral components that subsequently train your immune system to fight the virus.” “In this case, Moderna’s mRNA-1273 is programmed to make your cells produce the coronavirus’ infamous coronavirus spike protein that gives the virus its crown-like appearance (corona is crown in Latin) for which it is named,” wrote The Independent.

Under normal circumstances, very few people would sign up to have their cells “hijacked”, but at this point millions upon millions of people will be so desperate for a “solution” that they will take a vaccine no matter what the long-term consequences might be.

And if you don’t take one of the vaccines, you may soon find that you aren’t able to fly internationally…

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced this week it is in the final phase of development for what it hopes will be universally accepted documentation that in turn could boost confidence among wary travelers. The digital health pass would include a passenger’s testing and vaccine information and would manage and verify information among governments, airlines, laboratories and travelers.

If these new “digital vaccine passports” are implemented for international travel, it is probably just a matter of time before they are required for domestic travel as well.

Of course there are lots of people out there that are trying to sound the alarm about all of this, but UN communications director Melissa Fleming says that her organization has already recruited an army of “110,000 information volunteers” to combat the spread of “misinformation”…

Fleming told the World Economic Forum that #PledgetoPause and Verified have “recruited 110,000 information volunteers” thus far. She said “we equip these information volunteers with the kind of knowledge about how misinformation spreads and ask them to serve as kind of ‘digital first-responders’.” Fleming has stated elsewhere that the UN has “reached out to Member States, UN media partners, celebrity supporters” and “businesses” “to help us disseminate to the millions we will need to reach” with the campaign.

They want to control what you think as they lead you into a dystopian future that will ultimately turn into a complete and utter nightmare.

The truth is that none of us will be going back to our “normal lives” ever again.

But the elite will continue to hold that carrot out there in order to get you to do what they want, and millions upon millions of people will fall for it.",InfoWars,-1

In 2020, President Trump was supposedly soundly defeated even though he received 11 million more votes than he did in 2016.

They are telling us that Trump was defeated because of a historic turnout by Biden voters. But the number of counties that Biden actually won was a record low for a “winning candidate” by a very wide margin. It is being reported that Trump won 83 percent of all U.S. counties, and Biden only won 17 percent…

We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.

How in the world can you win the presidency by losing more than 80 percent of the counties in the entire country?

Yes, I understand that the major population centers are where the votes are. But when Obama won his two elections, at least he was victorious in more than 20 percent of all U.S. counties both times…

Former President Obama ushered in the previous low in 2012, winning re-election with just 689 counties, or 22 percent – breaking his own record set in 2008, where he won with 875 counties, or 28 percent.

Biden underperformed Obama almost everywhere except in the urban population centers that were absolutely critical to Biden’s victory.

In those urban population centers, Biden supposedly piled up obscene vote totals that are very difficult to believe.

And it just so happens that those heavily blue urban population centers all seemed to stop counting votes at about the same time on the night of the election. All of a sudden, voting came to a standstill in Milwaukee, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Atlanta.

As many have pointed out, if you stop and wait to see how all of the other areas of your state have voted, you can figure out exactly how many votes you need to put your candidate over the top.

When counting finally resumed, there were four massive vote dumps in the middle of the night which proved decisive in some of the most critical swing states…

An update in Michigan listed as of 6:31AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 141,258 votes for Joe Biden and 5,968 votes for Donald Trump An update in Wisconsin listed as 3:42AM Central Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 143,379 votes for Joe Biden and 25,163 votes for Donald Trump A vote update in Georgia listed at 1:34AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 136,155 votes for Joe Biden and 29,115 votes for Donald Trump An update in Michigan listed as of 3:50AM Eastern Time on November 4th, 2020, which shows 54,497 votes for Joe Biden and 4,718 votes for Donald Trump

In the end, Biden won Wisconsin by less than one percent, he won Pennsylvania by just over one percent, he won Georgia by less than one percent and he won Arizona by less than one percent.

If you reverse the results in those four states, President Trump would be the winner of the race.

The voting behavior in the key midwestern states was particularly suspicious. The following comes from Patrick Basham…

Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.

There are countless people that have been looking into how vote totals in the most critical swing states may have been manipulated, but the big tech companies have been doing their best to keep such information from spreading widely.

In fact, it is being reported that Facebook applied an “emergency change” to its news feed algorithm right after the election…

In the aftermath of the contentious presidential election, Facebook reportedly made an “emergency change” to its algorithm, which resulted in the suppression of content from “hyperpartisan” outlets. Employees at Facebook are now asking if the “nicer news feed” can stay in place long term, according to a Tuesday report from The New York Times.

This “nicer news feed” greatly favors mainstream news outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times.

The big tech companies are absolutely determined to shape how we think, and the power that they now possess is colossal.

They will determine what “truth” is allowed to be told in the years ahead, and they will continue to push our culture down a dystopian path that only leads to complete oblivion.

This election was a major turning point, and those that directed events behind the scenes are on the verge of totally getting away with it.

Ron Paul: Trump Pardons Flynn…It’s a Good Start!,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Last week President Trump granted a “full pardon” to Gen. Michael Flynn, his first National Security Advisor. In a White House statement announcing the pardon, the Administration pointed out that the relentless pursuit of Flynn was a partisan effort to overturn the results of the 2016 election.

The pursuit of Flynn was spearheaded by people who refused to accept the results of the 2016 election and worked to undermine the peaceful transfer of power, said the White House. These same people are the ones accusing Trump of undermining the election by challenging what appears to be serious voting irregularities in the 2020 presidential election.

That is called “projection.”

The White House statement also cites partisans in politics, the media, and the Deep State which sought to prevent Trump from being elected, to prevent him from taking office once elected, and to remove him on false pretenses once in office.

In order to push the false narrative that Trump was somehow elected due to the intervention of Russian President Vladimir Putin, the coup-masters had to make it appear that a high-ranking official was involved in monkey business with the Russians. Flynn was the unlucky victim of their smear machine, accused of “Russia collusion” over an innocent telephone call with the then-Russian Ambassador in Washington during the transition to a Trump Administration.

Yet when Joe Biden’s transition people bragged recently that Biden was connecting with foreign officials before inaugurated, the media praised it as a welcome return of the “experts” to foreign policy.

While it is very good news that President Trump is in the mood to pardon those victims of the warmongering Deep State, I very much hope that he is only warming up. It would be a great tragedy if other Deep State victims are left to suffer for their non-crimes.

Tweeting about her legislation that calls for charges against Edward Snowden and Julian Assange to be dropped and the Espionage Act reformed, US Rep. Tulsi Gabbard told President Trump, “since you’re giving pardons to people, please consider pardoning those who, at great personal sacrifice, exposed the deception and criminality of those in the deep state.”

My good friend Rep. Thomas Massie, a Ron Paul Institute Board Member, is a co-sponsor of Rep. Gabbard’s legislation, making it a real bipartisan effort to restore the rule of law in the United States and to rein in the Beltway warmongers.

Edward Snowden and Julian Assange are not criminals. They are heroes for telling us the truth about what criminals in government were doing in our name and with our money.

The fact is we were lied into war over and over again. While those wars were profitable for the military-industrial-Congressional-media complex, they snuffed out the lives of hundreds of thousands of innocent people overseas and robbed our own children and grandchildren of trillions of dollars wasted on neocon lies. And meanwhile, as Ed Snowden showed us, the intelligence community declared us the enemy and set up an elaborate internal spy network that would make the East German Stasi green with envy.

President Trump: you have the incredible opportunity to right the terrible wrongs perpetrated by the Obama/Biden Administration. History will smile kindly upon you if you also grant full pardon to Julian Assange and Edward Snowden – and any other truth-teller who faces persecution for exposing the Deep State warmongers.

“Dark Winter” Was The Code Name For A Scenario In Which A Biological Weapon Was Used Against The American Populace,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Could it be possible that the phrase “dark winter” has some sort of deeper meaning that most of us are not meant to understand?

We have heard that phrase over and over again in recent weeks, and usually it has been used in discussions regarding the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But it also turns out that “Dark Winter” was also a code name for a high level simulation that was conducted back in 2001.

That simulation envisioned a scenario in which a widespread smallpox attack was unleashed inside the United States.

As you will see below, the simulation was “designed to spiral out of control”, and the hypothetical consequences were absolutely disastrous.

Callers all over the nation are demanding the world arrest the criminals trying to steal the elction and getting away with it.

The reason why this is a concern is because so many of these “simulations” and “exercises” end up mirroring real life events that happen at a later date.

For example, most of you have probably heard about Event 201 by now. On October 18th, 2019 a group of prominent individuals gathered in New York City to simulate what would happen during a worldwide coronavirus pandemic…

Event 201 simulates an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.

Of course COVID-19 started spreading in China just a few weeks later.

We have seen this same pattern happen so many times, and now we are being told over and over again that a “dark winter” is ahead.

For example, Joe Biden specifically warned us about a “dark winter” during the final presidential debate in October…

Joe Biden warned at Thursday night’s presidential debate that the U.S. was “about to go into a dark winter,” echoing the concerns of public health experts who caution about increased daily Covid-19 case counts converging with the annual flu season. “We’re about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter,”Biden said. “And he has no clear plan, and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.”

It is interesting to note that he repeated the phrase twice.

It is almost as if he was determined to make sure that he said it correctly.

And then he started using the phrase over and over again on the campaign trail and he kept using it even after the voting was over.

For example, here is an instance where he used the phrase on the Monday after the election…

Joe Biden on Monday warned that a “very dark winter” is approaching as the U.S. coronavirus case count nears 10 million. “There is a need for bold action to fight this pandemic,” Biden said in Delaware. “We’re still facing a very dark winter.”

I never thought too much about his use of that phrase, but could it be possible that it is actually some sort of a code word or signal?

We do know that it was a code word for a high level exercise that was held in 2001. The following comes from Wikipedia…

It is interesting to note that smallpox is a highly infectious disease that involves sores appearing on the skin.

For those that have read my latest book, you already understand why that detail is so important to me.

And as I already mentioned above, this exercise was specifically designed “to spiral out of control”…

Dark Winter’s simulated scenario involved an initial localized smallpox attack on Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with additional smallpox attack cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The simulation was then designed to spiral out of control. This would create a contingency in which the National Security Council struggles to determine both the origin of the attack as well as deal with containing the spreading virus. By not being able to keep pace with the disease’s rate of spread, a new catastrophic contingency emerges in which massive civilian casualties would overwhelm America’s emergency response capabilities.

Could it be possible that Biden and others are using the phrase “dark winter” to signal that something is about to spiral out of control?

I don’t know. I am just asking the question.

In Operation Dark Winter, the spread of smallpox also resulted in a “massive loss of civilian life”…

The disastrous contingencies that would result in the massive loss of civilian life were used to exploit the weaknesses of the U.S. health care infrastructure and its inability to handle such a threat. The contingencies were also meant to address the widespread panic that would emerge and which would result in mass social breakdown and mob violence. Exploits would also include the many difficulties that the media would face when providing American citizens with the necessary information regarding safety procedures. Discussing the outcome of Dark Winter, Bryan Walsh noted “The timing–just a few months before the 9/11 attack–was eerily prescient, as if the organizers had foreseen how the threat of terrorism, including bioterrorism, would come to consume the U.S. government and public in the years to come.”[4]

So let me try to summarize what we have learned.

Operation Dark Winter envisioned a scenario in which a highly infectious disease that causes sores on the skin spirals out of control and causes a “massive loss of civilian life”.

And suddenly Joe Biden and other elitists have begun repeating this phrase over and over again as we head into 2021.

Landmark Legal Ruling Finds That Covid Tests Not Fit For Purpose — So What Does MSM Do? They Ignore It,[],"Four German holidaymakers who were illegally quarantined in Portugal after one was judged to be positive for Covid-19 have won their case, in a verdict that condemns the widely-used PCR test as being up to 97-percent unreliable.

Earlier this month, Portuguese judges upheld a decision from a lower court that found the forced quarantine of four holidaymakers to be unlawful. The case centred on the reliability (or lack thereof) of Covid-19 PCR tests.

The verdict, delivered on November 11, followed an appeal against a writ of habeas corpus filed by four Germans against the Azores Regional Health Authority. This body had been appealing a ruling from a lower court which had found in favour of the tourists, who claimed that they were illegally confined to a hotel without their consent. The tourists were ordered to stay in the hotel over the summer after one of them tested positive for coronavirus in a PCR test – the other three were labelled close contacts and therefore made to quarantine as well.

Unreliable, with a strong chance of false positives

The deliberation of the Lisbon Appeal Court is comprehensive and fascinating. It ruled that the Azores Regional Health Authority had violated both Portuguese and international law by confining the Germans to the hotel. The judges also said that only a doctor can “diagnose” someone with a disease, and were critical of the fact that they were apparently never assessed by one.

They were also scathing about the reliability of the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, the most commonly used check for Covid.

The conclusion of their 34-page ruling included the following: “In view of current scientific evidence, this test shows itself to be unable to determine beyond reasonable doubt that such positivity corresponds, in fact, to the infection of a person by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”

In the eyes of this court, then, a positive test does not correspond to a Covid case. The two most important reasons for this, said the judges, are that, “the test’s reliability depends on the number of cycles used’’ and that “the test’s reliability depends on the viral load present.’’ In other words, there are simply too many unknowns surrounding PCR testing.

Tested positive? There could be as little as a 3% chance it’s correct

This is not the first challenge to the credibility of PCR tests. Many people will be aware that their results have a lot to do with the number of amplifications that are performed, or the ‘cycle threshold.’ This number in most American and European labs is 35–40 cycles, but experts have claimed that even 35 cycles is far too many, and that a more reasonable protocol would call for 25–30 cycles. (Each cycle exponentially increases the amount of viral DNA in the sample).

Earlier this year, data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – showed that when the amount of the virus found in a person was taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who tested positive could actually have been negative, as they may have been carrying only tiny amounts of the virus.

The Portuguese judges cited a study conducted by “some of the leading European and world specialists,” which was published by Oxford Academic at the end of September. It showed that if someone tested positive for Covid at a cycle threshold of 35 or higher, the chances of that person actually being infected is less than three percent, and that “the probability of… receiving a false positive is 97% or higher.”

While the judges in this case admitted that the cycle threshold used in Portuguese labs was unknown, they took this as further proof that the detention of the tourists was unlawful. The implication was that the results could not be trusted. Because of this uncertainty, they stated that there was “no way this court would ever be able to determine” whether the tourist who tested positive was indeed a carrier of the virus, or whether the others had been exposed to it.

Sshhh – don’t tell anyone

It is a sad indictment of our mainstream media that such a landmark ruling, of such obvious and pressing international importance, has been roundly ignored. If one were making (flimsy) excuses for them, one could say that the case escaped the notice of most science editors because it has been published in Portuguese. But there is a full English translation of the appeal, and alternative media managed to pick it up.

And it isn’t as if Portugal is some remote, mysterious nation where news is unreliable or whose judges are suspect – this is a western EU country with a large population and a similar legal system to many other parts of Europe. And it is not the only country whose institutions are clashing with received wisdom on Covid. Finland’s national health authority has disputed the WHO’s recommendation to test as many people as possible for coronavirus, saying it would be a waste of taxpayer’s money, while poorer South East Asian countries are holding off on ordering vaccines, citing an improper use of finite resources.

Testing, especially PCR testing, is the basis for the entire house of cards of Covid restrictions that are wreaking havoc worldwide. From testing comes case numbers. From case numbers come the ‘R number,’ the rate at which a carrier infects others. From the ‘dreaded’ R number comes the lockdowns and the restrictions, such as England’s new and baffling tiered restrictions that come into force next week.

The daily barrage of statistics is familiar to us all by this point, but as time goes on the evidence that something may be deeply amiss with the whole foundation of our reaction to this pandemic – the testing regime – continues to mount.

Firm That Owns Dominion Voting Systems Received $400 Million From Swiss Bank Account Funded by Communist Chinese Gov & Companies Before Election,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

An investigation into SEC filings has revealed that the firm which owns Dominion Voting Systems received $400 million dollars from a Swiss bank with close links to the Chinese government less than a month before the election.

The investigation centers on Staple Street Capital, which acquired Dominion Voting Systems in 2018.

Dominion Voting Systems operates voting machines in 28 states and has been accused by President Trump and his supporters of being involved in deleting millions of votes for Trump in addition to switching votes to Biden on election night.

“On Oct 8, 2020, Staple Street Capital filed SEC Form D offerings and sales amount of $400,000,000 with the Sales Compensation Recipient identified as UBS Securities,” states the investigation, which also notes that another payment of $200,000,000 was received in December 2014.

“UBS Securities is a Swiss investment bank which owns 24.99% of UBS Securities Co LTD, a Chinese Investment Bank. The remaining 75% of UBS Securities CO LTD is owned by the Chinese government,” states the report.

The overall owners of UBS Securities Co LTD are;

– Beijing Guoxiang (33%)

– UBS (24.99%)

– Guangdong Comm. Group [zh] (14.01%)

– China Guodian (14%)

– COFCO Group (14%)

Aside from UBS, the other four owners of UBS Securities are all Communist Chinese front groups.

Beijing Guoxiang is a state owned asset.

Guangdong Comm. Group 100% stakeholder is the Guangdong Provincial Government.

China Guodian is state owned enterprise administered for the SASAC for the state Council

COFCO Group is a state owned enterprise under the direct supervision of the SASAC.

SASAC The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC) is a special commission of the People’s Republic of China, directly under the State Council.

The revelation that Dominion Voting Systems has financial ties to the Chinese government via UBS Securities will bolster claims by Trump supporters that foreign actors working on behalf of Communist China may have sought to meddle in the presidential election to help Joe Biden.

Other connections between Dominion Voting Systems and the Chinese government have also emerged in recent weeks, including the company’s Core Infrastructure Manager of Information Technology, Andy Huang, who previously worked for China Telecom, which is “wholly run by the Chinese government,” reported the National Pulse.

In her included op-ed entitled, “Biden’s personnel picks engender no legitimate GOP gripes”, Rubin started off shilling for a couple of Obama-era Democrats Biden reprised for his economic team, Cecilia Rouse for Council of Economic Advisers, and Janet Yellen to chair the Federal Reserve.

“Cecilia Rouse, Biden’s pick to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, drew raves from sensible conservatives,” Rubin said, citing the pro-Iraq War American Enterprise Institute (AEI).

Like Rouse, she cited AEI praising Yellen for being someone “who knows her way around Washington as well as around the corridors of power abroad.”

Rubin then exalted Democrat Neera Tanden, Biden’s pick for Office of Management and Budget, noting that the former Obama and Clinton underling is “pro-capitalism.”

“She is a card-carrying member of the pro-capitalism wing of the party,” Rubin wrote, as if that fact would reassure conservatives.

Additionally, Tanden is a rabid “Russia collusion” conspiracy theorist.

Rubin finished off her shill piece by lauding Biden’s “internationalist” foreign policy picks, former Obama and Clinton advisor Jake Sullivan and pro-China Democrat Antony Blinken, claiming their “traditional, mainstream foreign policy” of endless wars was “embraced by conservatives and liberals alike.”

“Likewise, Biden’s foreign policy picks — including Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and Antony Blinken as secretary of state, both advocates of a traditional, mainstream foreign policy — were embraced by conservatives and liberals alike,” Rubin wrote.

“As pro-NATO, pro-human-rights internationalists, these appointments align much more closely with the foreign policy framework of George H.W. Bush than of isolationists on the right and left.”

Rubin added that these former Obama and Clinton officials wouldn’t hinder Biden’s far-left agenda.

“None of this means that the Biden administration will shy away from progressive goals, such as strengthening Obamacare, expanding green energy or pushing for police and criminal justice reform,” she noted.

In sum, Rubin thinks the Republican Party shouldn’t “gripe” about Biden’s collection of pro-endless war Obama and Clinton minions retaking control of the country for Biden to enact his far-left agenda.

In a stark contrast to the idea of “open, transparent” elections, Georgia state lawyers said the “trade secrets” of voting machines must be preserved.

The lawyers, who represent top Georgia state officials, made the argument when trying to fight against allowing public, forensic inspections of the voting machines used in several Georgia counties.

“Defendants’ counsel also argued that allowing such forensic inspections would pose substantial security and proprietary/trade secret risks to Defendants,” read the order by Judge Timothy Batten demanding that voting software and information should not be destroyed, erased or altered in Cobb, Gwinnett, and Cherokee Counties.

Fauci, the director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Paul clashed a couple times in recent months over Covid lockdowns, with Paul arguing that children are not at risk of the virus the way older populations are.

“Dr. Fauci, every day we seem to hear from you things we can’t do. But when you’re asked, ‘Can we go back to school?’ I don’t hear much certitude at all. ‘Well, maybe.’ ‘It depends.’ Guess what?

Biden Mulling Rahm Emanuel for Department of Transportation Chief – Report,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Democrat Joe Biden is strongly considering Rahm Emanuel’s candidacy for the head of the Department of Transportation, an Axios report said on Sunday.

According to former Secretary Ray LaHood, quoted in the report, the DOT position will matter a lot since AI technologies, including smart cities and drone-deliveries, are coming to the fore.

“You’re talking about 20–25 percent of the economy,” LaHood commented. “Everybody’s on hold until they see what the administration is going to do about Rahm.”

Media speculated earlier that Emanuel could be chosen for the post, which triggered criticism from a number of US politicians. Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez complained on Twitter that Rahm Emanuel is not a suitable person for the position, accusing him of “covering up” the murder of Laquan McDonald. Emanuel served as the former mayor of Chicago at the time when 17-year-old McDonald was fatally shot by police. In January 2019, an officer was sentenced to nearly seven years in prison in connection with his death.

“It is shameful and concerning that he is even being considered”, AOC posted.

The decision on the DOT chief will only be made after picks for the Defence and Justice Department are announced.

Fauci Warns of COVID ‘Surge Upon a Surge’,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The top U.S. infectious disease expert warned Sunday of a possible, upcoming spike of the coronavirus.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, speaking on “This Week” on ABC-TV, said the infection rate would not “all of a sudden turn around” and in the coming weeks, following the recent Thanksgiving holiday, “We may see a surge upon a surge.”

Also Sunday, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS-TV, that people who traveled during the holiday “have to assume that you were exposed, and you became infected and you really need to get tested in the next week.” She also called on people who had traveled during the holiday to avoid people older than 65 or who have an underlying disease.

The doctors’ warnings come as the U.S. on Saturday recorded more than 4 million infections for November alone, more than doubling the 1.9 million record set in October.

The U.S. has 13.3 million of the world’s 62.7 million COVID-19 cases, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. The U.S. has more cases of the virus than any other country in the world. India and Brazil follow the U.S. in case numbers with 9.3 million and 6.3 million respectively.

India recorded nearly 42,000 new COVID infections Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins.

In Europe, some countries are hoping for a continent wide agreement to shut down ski resorts during the Christmas holidays to help prevent spreading the coronavirus. No unified pact, however, has yet been reached.

President Trump gave his first interview to Fox News since Election Day to explain the “rigged election” and how his legal team is handling the partisan courts and fake news media as they bring lawsuits to several battleground states.

Speaking on “Sunday Morning Futures,” Trump began by slamming the lower courts for dismissing his election fraud lawsuits despite having plenty of evidence to present.

“We’re not allowed to put in our proof. They say you don’t have standing,” Trump told host Maria Bartiromo. “I would like to file one nice big beautiful lawsuit, talking about this and many other things, with tremendous proof. We have affidavits, we have hundreds and hundreds of affidavits.”

“You mean as president of the United States, I don’t have standing? What kind of a court system is this?” Trump continued.

“We’re trying to put the evidence in, and the judges won’t allow us to do it,” Trump said. “We have so much evidence. You probably saw Wednesday last week we had a hearing in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania…Unbelievable witnesses, highly-respected people, that were truly aggrieved.”

Trump noted that if Republican lawmakers don’t fight against the unprecedented fraud brought by the Democrats, they’ll never win another election again.

“If Republicans allow it to happen, you’ll never have another Republican elected in the history of this country, at a Senate level or at a presidential level…or at a House level,” Trump said.

Trump also laid into the fake news media and Big Tech, who he says are purposely “suppressing” the election fraud developments.

“We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression of press,” Trump said. “You can’t have a scandal if no one reports about it.”

“They make it like we don’t have evidence, we have evidence all over the place,” he added.

Bottom line, he said, is that Biden did not get 80 million legal votes, and his team of lawyers intends to prove that.

Biden Reportedly Mulls Promoting ‘Taliban Bounties Story’ Congresswoman to be CIA Director,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Joe Biden began announcing picks for his cabinet this week, even as incumbent Donald Trump continues to refuse to concede, citing alleged widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, Biden selected Antony Blinken – his former vice-presidential national security adviser and a proponent of war in Iraq, Libya and Syria – for the key post of secretary of state.

The Biden camp is actively considering naming Democrat congresswoman for Michigan, Elissa Slotkin – a former CIA analyst, senior Pentagon official and Iraq War intelligence operative – as his CIA director, the New York Times has reported, citing people said to be familiar with the deliberations.

The 44-year-old New York City native is known to have served three tours of duty in Iraq as a CIA militia expert during the late Bush and early Obama administrations, and then to have gone on to work at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. In 2012, she moved to the Pentagon and, in 2015, was tapped for the role of acting secretary of defence for international security affairs.

At the Defence Department, Slotkin was involved in ramping up the scale of US military operations on Russia’s western borders, and at the same time charged with ensuring ‘deconfliction’ between Russian and US military aircraft in Syria. Her responsibilities are also said to have included drone and cyber warfare, as well as homeland defence.

During her bid for Congress in 2018, the World Socialist Website named Slotkin as one of ‘The CIA Democrats’, ie, one of a peculiarly large body of former intelligence and military personnel seeking to compete for vulnerable Republican-held seats in the mid-term elections.

Criticism of Trump

Slotkin co-authored an op-ed in The Detroit News last week urging Donald Trump to concede the election. In October, she reportedly expressed concerns that America might be ‘hurtling toward’ a constitutional crisis based on Trump’s allegations of plans by the Democrats to rig the election.

Slotkin has attacked Trump on a range of foreign policy matters, from his Iran policy, to his corruption probe against the Biden family’s alleged corruption in Ukraine (which she said warranted Trump’s impeachment), to what she characterised as his strange relationship with Russia.

In the summer of 2020, when the New York Times, the Washington Post and other US media reported the (since debunked) claims by ‘anonymous intelligence officials’ that Russia had offered the Taliban* bounties for US troops’ heads, Slotkin blasted Trump over his many telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and suggested that there was “something… off about” the relationship between the two men “since the beginning,” with Americans “quite literally paying in blood for [Trump’s] pandering to Putin”, in Afghanistan.

The White House, Russian officials and the Taliban have since dismissed the ‘bounty’ claims, with the militia accusing the Afghan government of deliberately seeking to derail the withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn Central Asian nation.

In October, Slotkin asked Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to brief congress on the extent of the alleged threat posed by Russia and Iran to the US election process, claiming that the Russian and Iranian efforts “remain persistent and sadly effective in sowing distrust and division among the American people”.

Slotkin made headlines last week when she said she would not support Nancy Pelosi’s bid to be speaker of the House, briefly causing speculation about serious divisions in the Democrat Party. Pelosi handily won re-election as speaker anyway, with no one stepping up to challenge her.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Edward Snowden is calling for an end to “the war on whistleblowers” after he shot back at a politician who slammed him and Julian Assange as “Russian agents.”

“Snowden and Assange are Russian agents who pose a direct threat to the US national interests,” Tony Gonzales, a congressman-elect to the Texas House of Representatives, tweeted.

The message was in response to a plea from Rep. Tulsi Gabbard for both Snowden and Assange to receive full pardons.

“Politicians take note,” Snowden warned when responding to Gonzales, “smearing whistleblowers and publishers with obvious bull***t no longer gets you showered in likes, it gets you ratioed by a furious public.”

Snowden highlighted the amount of retweets the “Russian agents” message got (just over 500 at that time, and just over 650 now vs. over 3000 comments, many of them critical of the post).

“It is time to end the war on whistleblowers,” Snowden added.

Calls for a pardon for Snowden — who remains in Russia where he fled following leaving the US after releasing classified documents in 2013 showing the government was mass-collecting citizens’ personal data — have intensified as President Donald Trump is preparing to likely leave office.

Julian Assange is facing separate espionage charges related to WikiLeaks’ publication of military documents a decade ago. He is currently in a British prison awaiting a judge’s decision on whether he will be extradited to the US.

As well as Gabbard, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Florida), Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky), and others have called for charges to be dropped against the whistleblower.

On Friday, Snowden retweeted a Twitter poll with over 78,000 respondents asking whether he should receive a pardon. Nearly 70 percent said yes, while less than 15 percent said no.

“Close the bars and keep the schools open,” Dr. Anthony Fauci says, adding that while there is no solution that is “one size fits all,” the “best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of the spread low.” https://t.co/th9oAKhHYa pic.twitter.com/pDuTdQ0Vfp — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 29, 2020

"DATA: Biden Needed 130% Of Vote To ‘Win’ Arizona, Trump Needed -30% To Lose",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Scientist, engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and four-time Massachusetts Institute of Technology degree holder Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai delved deep into Arizona’s 2020 presidential election vote tabulation data during the state’s election integrity hearing on Monday.

Dr. Ayyadurai revealed that pattern recognition software that tried to replicate the curve of Joe Biden’s reported vote total could only match the reported results if votes for Biden were counted at a 130% rate – in other words, every Democrat ballot counting for 1.3 votes to Trump’s 1.0.

Dr. Ayyadurai’s software tried numerous solutions to replicate the curve of Biden’s vote count in 734 Arizona precincts, and “the only one that we were able to come close to matching was this, and I want everyone to look at this carefully. The interesting possibility we find here is that when the Democrat percentage is 130% Mr. Biden, and -30% Mr. Trump… it matches perfectly. Near perfectly. The slopes match, the curves match the shapes match.”

“So what that tells us is that this demographic distribution of allocation of party affiliations is what can generate this, and I find it highly implausible because this means that Mr. Biden got 130% of Democrat voters, and President Trump got negative 30%,” Dr. Ayyadurai stated.

Dr. Ayyadurai found that there were two possibilities for such an implausible descrepancy: either there was a niche demographic of Independent Biden voters that existed beyond the computer model’s ability to replicate the curve, or Biden’s votes were multiplied by 1.3 (130%).

In the latter scenario, President Trump’s vote totals would have to be reduced by 30% in accordance with the 130% gained by Biden, a scenario could only occur through swapping preexisting votes between the two candidates.

“So basically, votes were being eaten from President Trump and being handed over to Mr. Biden,” Dr. Ayyadurai noted.

You are supposed to deliver the USB drive, not plug it into an external laptop and manipulate it in the file explorer before palming it… The machines should not be connected in any way. The fact that he plugged the Election Management System data into an external laptop and manipulated it in the file explorer before palming is enough to consider the entire election in that county to be compromised.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) – who President Trump last Thursday called an “enemy of the people” for allegedly making some type of “deal” with Democratic operative Stacey Abrams over ballot harvesting – said on Monday that he’s suddenly concerned with progressive groups trying to sign up new voters in advance of a Jan. 5 Senate runoff which could flip the GOP-controlled chamber blue.

Patrick Byrne, former CEO of Overstock.com, says he’s funding a group of ‘hackers, cybersleuths, and other people with odd skills’ to prove that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election, and that President Trump rightfully won.

“I’ve funded a team of hackers and cybersleuths, other people with odd skills,” Byrne told One America News.

The 57-year-old multimillionaire also appeared on several podcasts, including a November 23 appearance in which he said: “I’m a free agent, and I’m self-funded, and I’m funding this army of various odd people,” according to the Daily Beast.

“It’s really going to make a great movie someday,” he added.

Byrne claims he’s funding teams of “hackers and crackers” who realized all the way back in August that Dominion voting machines could be used to steal the election from Trump. Since the election, those voting machines have figured prominently in Trump supporters’ allegations of fraud, despite the company’s repeated denials and any actual proof the voting tallies were changed. – Daily Beast

Byrne says he’s been communicating with former Trump attorney Sidney Powell for weeks – who last week filed two lawsuits in Michigan and Georgia alleging massive schemes to rig the election for Joe Biden.

According to Powell’s Georgia lawsuit: “Old-fashioned ballot-stuffing” has been “amplified and rendered virtually invisible by computer software created and run by domestic and foreign actors for that very purpose,” adding that “Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia.”

In Michigan, Powell claims that “hundreds of thousands of illegal, ineligible, duplicate, or purely fictitious ballots” enabled by “massive election fraud” facilitated Biden’s win in the state.

The suit claimed that election software and hardware from Dominion Voting Systems used by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers helped facilitate the fraud.

More via Natural News:

Speaking to Christopher McDonald of The McFiles in a recent interview, the former head of a $200 billion e-commerce company that has never once gotten hacked revealed that Dominion Voting Systems were used to perform a “Drop and Roll” technique of voter fraud that slyly padded the vote for Biden in at least five key swing areas of the country.

Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Maricopa County, Arizona (Phoenix) were all rigged prior to election day to strip President Trump of his rightful win in each of these states. Byrne also mentioned Clark County, Nevada (Las Vegas) as another election fraud locale, though this one was more secondary.

According to Byrne, who is not a supporter of President Trump but rather a “small l” libertarian, these five (or six if you include Clark County) areas are where a bulk of the election fraud took place. It did not have to be widespread because these were the key swing areas that Biden needed to “win” in order to steal the election.

“By cheating those five counties, you flip five key states, you flip the electoral college,” Byrne says. “In places where Trump lost by 10,000, there may be 300,000 fake, illegal votes for Biden. So this isn’t even close.”

Salty water is impossible to drink and so salt removal is obligatory, notably using methods of breaking water into oxygen and hydrogen, the process is extremely complex and costly. The possibility of obtaining oxygen and hydrogen out of briny water would make the process much easier and cheaper.

The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), on Monday published research into a new system, developed by the engineers at Washington University in St. Louis, that can directly coerce the elements out of unusable salty water.

The research team, led by Vijay Ramani, Roma B. and Raymond H. Wittcoff, examined the system both in terrestrial conditions and in a simulated Martian atmosphere of -33 ⁰F (-36 ⁰C).

“Our Martian brine electrolyzer radically changes the logistical calculus of missions to Mars and beyond,” said Ramani. “This technology is equally useful on Earth where it opens up the oceans as a viable oxygen and fuel source.”

This technology will provide an additional pathway to help NASA accomplish its mission of landing humans on Mars by 2033. Perchlorate brine electrolyzers are more efficient than the current state-of-the-art alkaline water electrolyzers under terrestrial conditions that provide a route to use suboptimal input to produce ultrapure hydrogen and oxygen, according to PNAS. The approach lays out a unique pathway to life-support and fuel production for future human missions to Mars.

Future astronauts will need to manufacture water to live on the red planet, as well as the fuel necessary for their trip home. The system developed in Ramani’s lab can produce both, without the need for heating or purifying a water source.

“Paradoxically, the dissolved perchlorate in the water, so-called impurities, actually help in an environment like that of Mars,” said Shrihari Sankarasubramanian, a research scientist in Ramani’s group and a joint author of the paper.

The fact that the new system can work with “sub-optimal”, or salty, water can significantly lower the cost of electrolysis devices everywhere, including on Earth.

The Ramani team expects to join forces with NASA to further develop the system and also hope that it will be used to help divers explore uncharted environments in the deep sea. ‘Having demonstrated these electrolyzers under demanding Martian conditions, we intend to also deploy them under much milder conditions on Earth to utilize brackish or salt water feeds to produce hydrogen and oxygen, for example through seawater electrolysis’, said Pralay Gayen, a research team associate.

In 2019 NASA announced that intended to send astronauts to Mars by 2033. NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology that the Mars landing could be moved up by moving up the moon landing.

“We need to learn how to live and work in another world. The moon is the best place to prove those capabilities and technologies. The sooner we can achieve that objective, the sooner we can move on to Mars”, Bridenstine said on April 2, 2019.

New Hubble Data Explains Missing Dark Matter,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

In 2018 an international team of researchers using the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and several other observatories uncovered, for the first time, a galaxy in our cosmic neighborhood that is missing most of its dark matter.

This discovery of the galaxy NGC 1052-DF2 was a surprise to astronomers, as it was understood that dark matter is a key constituent in current models of galaxy formation and evolution.

In fact, without the presence of dark matter, the primordial gas would lack enough gravitational pull to start collapsing and forming new galaxies. A year later, another galaxy that misses dark matter was discovered, NGC 1052-DF4, which further triggered intense debates among astronomers about the nature of these objects.

Now, new Hubble data have been used to explain the reason behind the missing dark matter in NGC 1052-DF4, which resides 45 million light-years away.

Mireia Montes of the University of New South Wales in Australia led an international team of astronomers to study the galaxy using deep optical imaging. They discovered that the missing dark matter can be explained by the effects of tidal disruption.

The gravity forces of the neighboring massive galaxy NGC 1035 are tearing NGC 1052-DF4 apart.

During this process, the dark matter is removed, while the stars feel the effects of the interaction with another galaxy at a later stage.

Until now, the removal of dark matter in this way has remained hidden from astronomers as it can only be observed using extremely deep images that can reveal extremely faint features. “We used Hubble in two ways to discover that NGC 1052-DF4 is experiencing an interaction,” explained Montes. “This includes studying the galaxy’s light and the galaxy’s distribution of globular clusters.”

Thanks to Hubble’s high resolution, the astronomers could identify the galaxy’s globular cluster population. The 10.4-meter Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) telescope and the IAC80 telescope in the Canary Islands of Spain were also used to complement Hubble’s observations by further studying the data.

“It is not enough just to spend a lot of time observing the object, but a careful treatment of the data is vital,” explained team member Raúl Infante-Sainz of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Spain. “It was therefore important that we use not just one telescope/instrument, but several (both ground- and space-based) to conduct this research. With the high resolution of Hubble, we can identify the globular clusters, and then with GTC photometry we obtain the physical properties.”

Globular clusters are thought to form in the episodes of intense star formation that shaped galaxies. Their compact sizes and luminosity make them easily observable, and they are therefore good tracers of the properties of their host galaxy. In this way, by studying and characterizing the spatial distribution of the clusters in NGC 1052-DF4, astronomers can develop insight into the present state of the galaxy itself. The alignment of these clusters suggests they are being “stripped” from their host galaxy, and this supports the conclusion that tidal disruption is occurring.

By studying the galaxy’s light, the astronomers also found evidence of tidal tails, which are formed of material moving away from NGC 1052-DF4. This further supports the conclusion that this is a disruption event. Additional analysis concluded that the central parts of the galaxy remain untouched and only about 7% of the stellar mass of the galaxy is hosted in these tidal tails. This means that dark matter, which is less concentrated than stars, was previously and preferentially stripped from the galaxy, and now the outer stellar component is starting to be stripped as well.

“This result is a good indicator that, while the dark matter of the galaxy was evaporated from the system, the stars are only now starting to suffer the disruption mechanism,” explained team member Ignacio Trujillo of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias in Spain. “In time, NGC 1052-DF4 will be cannibalized by the large system around NGC 1035, with at least some of their stars floating free in deep space.”

The discovery of evidence to support the mechanism of tidal disruption as the explanation for the galaxy’s missing dark matter has not only solved an astronomical conundrum, but has also brought a sigh of relief to astronomers. Without it, scientists would be faced with having to revise our understanding of the laws of gravity.

“This discovery reconciles existing knowledge of how galaxies form and evolve with the most favorable cosmological model,” added Montes.

New Instrument Hunts for Ancient Metal in Space,[],"Researchers created a new astronomical instrument that has successfully aided in estimating the abundance of metals in the early universe.

The WINERED instrument allows for better observations of astronomical bodies like quasars in the early universe, billions of years ago.

Researchers hope this deeper level of exploration could help answer questions about the origins not only of metals in the universe but also of the stars themselves.

Iron is one of the most important elements for life as we know it, and for the technology, both primitive and modern, that has shaped human history. But details of the exact origin of iron and other important metals such as magnesium remain elusive. Exploration of this is important in the field of astronomy as it also connected to the origins of the first stars that would have begun to shine several hundred million years after the Big Bang.

Project Research Associate Hiroaki Sameshima from the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Tokyo and his team decided a new instrument was needed to study these matters. Due to limited instrumentation, previous observations to collect data for the study of metals’ origins mainly looked at old stars nearby. But this only gave astronomers information about our own unique galaxy. A new instrument with enhanced sensitivity to near-infrared light could push the boundary and open up observations of distant quasars, ferociously energetic ancient galactic cores that emitted light when the universe was only 2.4 billion years old.

“By mounting the WINERED instrument on a large telescope, we can see further back in time as we can observe bodies more distant, or more ancient, than those from previous studies. We can now see details of quasars over 10 billion years old,” said Sameshima. “WINERED is a special kind of spectrograph, which can read the chemical signatures present in the light from distant bodies. It revealed to us the fingerprints of iron and magnesium in the light from these quasars, and this allowed us to calculate the abundance of these elements when the universe was much younger than previous studies allowed.”

Now that the researchers have established a new method to directly examine the abundance of metals in the early universe, the challenge becomes one of refining the technique and broadening its scope to collect more data. With improved data, astronomers can build on this study and create theories to explain the origins of metals including the iron in your blood.

Trump Says Big Tech Immunities Must Be Terminated for ‘National Security’ Reasons,[],"President Trump posted to Twitter late Thursday evening his call for the “immediate” termination of Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act, declaring that the liability protections of Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter should be stripped for “purposes of national security.”

For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

Currently, Big Tech companies claim they act as a neutral platform, meaning that they receive certain protections from what people post on their site under Section 230, which gives them a “liability shield.” However, given that they have engaged in the censorship of conservatives, they act more like a publisher, who is more liable for what is on their site.

The announcement followed a tweet from President Trump that attacked Twitter for “sending out totally false ‘Trends’ that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world.” He argued that the trends are simply made up, and they are only “negative” ones. “Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to Fox News daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination!” the President concluded.

Twitter is sending out totally false “Trends” that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. They make it up, and only negative “stuff”. Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to @FoxNews daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

This is not the first time that the President has called for the end of Section 230. Last month, after Facebook and Twitter removed a story from the New York post about emails between Joe Biden and his son Hunter, he also called for the repeal of Section 230. However, this is the first time that the call has been made to do it “immediately,” and also the first time “national security” has been posited as a reason for doing so.

So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of “Smoking Gun” emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician. REPEAL SECTION 230!!! https://t.co/g1RJFpIVUZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2020

The President’s actions may have had something to do with the behaviour of Big Tech over the course of this election. Throughout the election, a large quantity of the President’s tweets and other social media postings, along with those of many of his supporters, have been labelled as misinformation, with Tucker Carlson even arguing that Big Tech rigged the election in favour of Joe Biden “in plain sight.”

Only this week, the personal Twitter account of Pennsylvania state Senator Doug Mastriano was banned, after the Senator had organised a hearing in his state’s legislature about the vast irregularities that took place in this month’s presidential election.

In May this year, the President signed an executive order that would strip the liability shield away from Big Tech companies if they engaged in “censoring or any political conduct.” As National File reported:

The executive order also instructs Attorney General William Barr to work with the states to develop their own legislation regarding censorship online, and also instructs his adminstration to start developing policies to “ensure taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media that suppresses free speech. The President noted that Big Tech companies have had “unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter, virtually any communication between private citizens and large public audiences.”",InfoWars,-1

Gove Claims Government Not Considering ‘Vaccine Passports’ to Enter Venues,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove contradicted his own government’s vaccine minister by asserting that there were no plans to issue ‘vaccination passports’ that would be required before people were allowed to enter bars, restaurants and other venues.

As we highlighted yesterday, during an interview on BBC Radio, UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested that the NHS ‘track and trace’ app would be used to digitally store information about whether a person has been inoculated or not.

“I think you’ll find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, football stadiums, will probably also use that system,” said Zahawi.

With airlines also suggesting they will adopt the system, this creates the prospect of millions of people who refuse to take the vaccine being prevented from being able to travel or engage in basic social activities.

However, in an interview with Sky News earlier today, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said no such plans were being considered.

""I certainly am not planning to issue any vaccine passports and i don't know anyone else in government who would.""@michaelgove tells @kayburley there will not be a #COVID19 vaccine passport.#KayBurley https://t.co/UV70Cs1n0C pic.twitter.com/mVAnfR7ttK — Sky News (@SkyNews) December 1, 2020

“People in this country have common sense, the overwhelming majority can see that getting vaccinated is not just good for you, it’s also good for others, it’s a way of making sure that granny and grandad, mum and dad are safe,” said Gove.

Asked if there would be a vaccine passport, Gove responded, “No, that’s not being planned.”

“I certainly am not planning to issue any vaccine passports and I don’t know anyone else in government who would,” he added.

However, as we have previously discussed, service providers and companies could still require proof of vaccination outside any government involvement, potentially using technology like the ‘Common Pass’ being developed by the World Economic Forum.

Gove’s denial also contradicts NHS Test and Trace boss Baroness Harding’s indication that the NHS app will be used to “record as a citizen of your test results and whether you’ve been vaccinated.”

Report: UK Deploys Military INFOWAR Unit Against COVID Vaccine Skeptics,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The British government has mobilised an elite “information warfare” unit to combat “anti-vaccine militants” and interrupt their “propaganda content” online, according to a report in The Sunday Times.

The report (behind a paywall) says that the unit is usually used to assist with operations against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, but now will be turned on to those who dare question the sanctity of COVID vaccination.

The army has mobilised an elite “information warfare” unit renowned for assisting operations against al-Qaeda and the Taliban to counter online propaganda against vaccines, as Britain prepares to deliver its first injections within days. https://t.co/7JY2gl0oMj — The Times (@thetimes) November 29, 2020

The report further notes that the outfit known as ‘The defence cultural specialist unit’ was formed in Afghanistan in 2010 and is part of the army’s 77th Brigade.

“The secretive unit has often worked side-by-side with psychological operations teams,” the report adds.

Nice… The government employing the military to use psyops on the public to ensure no one strays from the acceptable opinion on the vaccine.



How is OperationWarpSpeed like Mickey’s Sorcerer’s Apprentice? Is the mRNA vaccine messing with something they can’t control? OWS is exactly what Bill Gates ordered with IA2030. Instead of $20 BILLION to build a wall, instead of military protecting US border, we have $20B for an untested experimental vaccine run by and delivered by the military.

The Times claims that the move was revealed by ‘leaked’ documents’.

“Soldiers are already monitoring cyberspace for Covid-19 content and analysing how British citizens are being targeted online,” it claims.

Of course, the government claims that muh Russians are involved… a way of confusing people into accepting the enforcement of group think by military spies.

“It is also gathering evidence of vaccine disinformation from hostile states, including Russia,” the report states.

Exactly what constitutes vaccine “disinformation” will be down to the government, and will likely make a target of anyone who points out potential side effects of vaccination, or questions the idea of mandating the jab, whether literally by law or by making it impossible to participate in society without it.

After the ‘leak’ came to light, the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that the unit is “not being directed at the UK population,” only at ‘hostile foreign actors’.

Yeah, OK.

Just like the GCHQ spook unit inside 10 Downing Street is also not targeted at the public.

A fortnight ago it was revealed by The London Telegraph (Paywall) that spies from Britain’s most secretive intelligence and security organisation have embedded a ‘cell’ at the heart of government to provide Prime Minister Boris Johnson with real time information pertaining to the public’s movements.

Words we didn't expect to read in 2020:

The Daily Mail also reports on the development, which notes that GCHQ, normally tasked with spying on terrorists and foreign powers, has been turned on the British public to gauge whether people are following the COVID ‘rules’ or not, and to combat anti-vaccination material.

Speaking anonymously to the London Times in November, a source noted that “GCHQ has been told to take out antivaxers online and on social media. There are ways they have used to monitor and disrupt terrorist propaganda.”

The report noted that the spy agency was considering taking down websites and content that isn’t pro-vaccination, as well as ‘disrupting’ those creating the content by “using a toolkit developed to tackle disinformation and recruitment material peddled by Islamic State.”",InfoWars,-1
Red Cross Warns ‘Fake Vaccine News’ Could Cause “Second Pandemic”,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The head of the Red Cross has warned that the spread of “fake news” concerning vaccines could cause a “second pandemic”.

German news agency Deutsche Welle reports that Francesco Rocca, president of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, commented during a virtual round table discussion that there is a “parallel pandemic of distrust” that needs to be defeated.

The report notes that Rocca warned of a “growing hesitancy” globally toward vaccines, noting that “a vaccine in-and-of-itself will not be enough to end this pandemic.”

Rocca also asserted that the lack of trust in vaccines “is by no means a Western phenomenon,” further noting that “In several African countries, we have seen a common skepticism towards vaccines in general, with a common belief being that foreigners use Africa as a medical `testing ground.”‘

“We believe that the massive, coordinated efforts that will be needed to roll out the COVID vaccine in an equitable manner need to be paralleled by equally massive efforts to proactively build and maintain trust,” Rocca said.

“We stand ready to support government efforts to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine, including by leading and supporting efforts to counteract misinformation and build trust,” Rocca added.

A John Hopkins study is taken down after it says COVID is no big deal and deaths are misattributed to COVID. And, CDC shows that 90% of people sick enough to be hospitalized still recover (in spite of medical negligence).

Rocca warned against the rise of “vaccine nationalism”, a concern previously posited by Bill Gates that not everyone in the world will be given access to a COVID vaccine.

Rocca called for a globally coordinated effort to vaccinate everyone via a program known as the COVAX facility.

“We call again on all the governments who have not joined the COVAX facility to consider doing so and to show leadership at theinternational level. We also call on governments who have joined the COVAX facility to increase their allocation to this valuable multilateral mechanism to further increase equity in future vaccine distribution,” the Red Cross head said.

“The vaccine must go to where it is needed, not just to where it can be afforded,” Rocca added.

The comments come amid concerns that the vaccines will be made mandatory all over the world, either by law or by means of social coercion.

The UK government has today scrambled to clarify remarks made Monday by UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, indicating that so called “immunity passports” may be required by bars, restaurants, cinemas and stadiums for people to enter.

Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove denied that the government is planning to implement such a scheme, but admitted that “Of course, individual businesses have the capacity to make decisions about who they will admit and why.”",InfoWars,-1
"Vaccine Minister Says Bars, Restaurants & Cinemas Will Demand Proof of Vaccination Before Entry",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi says he expects bars, cinemas, restaurants and sports stadiums to all demand proof of vaccination against COVID-19 before allowing customers to enter their venues.

Speaking with BBC Radio’s The World at One earlier today, Zahawi responded to the host’s question about immunity passports that are registered within a phone app to be allowed to enter a sports stadium or to travel.

“I think you’ll find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, football stadiums, will probably also use that system,” said Zahawi.

Zahawi went on to explain that the NHS’ ‘track and trace’ app, the use of which was implemented as a requirement to enter bars and restaurants, had set the pretext for the vaccine eventually being made mandatory to enter such venues.

In Day 2 as Vaccine Minister, @nadhimzahawi endorses the NHS App morphing into an immunity passport. Asked if “it will become virtually impossible to do anything without a vaccine”, he said “People will have to make a decision”. This misguided, chilling and wrong. pic.twitter.com/ZvYiFKiGfp — Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) November 30, 2020

“In many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who will say demonstrate to us that you’ve been vaccinated, but also we will make the technology as easy and as accessible as possible,” he added.

The host responded by clarifying that “it would become virtually impossible to do anything if you don’t have the vaccine.”

The comment once again highlights how governments don’t need to make the vaccine compulsory by law, they will simply lean on the travel, leisure and entertainment industry to make life virtually impossible for those who refuse to take it.

By setting the benchmark that virtually any social activity will require people to take the shot, those who refuse will essentially be confined to a form of lockdown for potentially the rest of their lives.

As we previously highlighted, the airline industry is also signaling that it will mandate the vaccine in order for passengers to travel, with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce already insisting that this will be the case.

Not content with metaphorically canceling Christmas in recent years in an attempt to be ‘woke’, CNN wants to literally cancel the holiday this year, declaring “we just can’t do it” because of COVID.

CNN Newsroom host Boris Sanchez rolled out “medical analyst” Dr. Jonathan Reiner, setting up the segment by announcing that Reiner had last week called Thanksgiving “the mother of all super spreader events.”

The Grinch then decreed that Americans shouldn’t even be thinking about gathering or traveling for Christmas.

“People tend to travel, want to travel, want to be with family, but we just can’t do it this year,” Reiner declared.

Turning up the panicometer, Reiner proclaimed that “We’re going to cause needless deaths and particularly that’s among people we really care about, you know, our most vulnerable, our grandparents, our parents, our — our neighbors.”

“We can’t travel this year. We need to stay home,” Reiner asserted, adding “This is a sacrifice that Americans can make and we should be making it for each other.”

Killing The Future: COVID Madness Will Lead To HALF A MILLION Fewer U.S. Births In 2021,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Research has concluded that the US will experience 500,000 fewer births in 2021, as couples choose not to have children because of the coronavirus fallout.

The findings by the Brookings Institute were published last week in the Wall Street Journal, which noted that there will be “between 300,000 to 500,000 fewer births in the U.S. next year, compared with a drop of 44,172 last year.”

The numbers equate to a 13% drop from the 3.8 million babies born in 2019.

The “analysis, partly based on what happened following the 2007-2009 recession, is that weaker job prospects equate to fewer births,” the report further notes.

“Women will have many fewer babies in the short term, and for some of them, a lower total number of children over their lifetimes,” the research, previously previewed in the Summer, noted.

The US birthrate is already at its lowest level on record, and according to clinics, there has been a 50% jump in requests for birth control since the beginning of the pandemic, and a 40% increase in requests for Plan B.

CDC research notes that the birth rate in the US has been below replacement level since 1971. It is now a problem across all major racial groups including Hispanics, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanic Asians. All have below replacement birth levels.

A recent survey from the Guttmacher Institute discovered that 34% of women able to have babies in the US have made a decision to either delay having a child, or to just have fewer children because of COIVD.

Analysts say this will have a long and profound impact on the economy for many years to come, as the US could be falling into a so called ‘Fertility trap’ where there are fewer women around to have babies, resulting in smaller families, and low population growth reducing economic growth.

All of this results in increased pessimism and a downward spiral that is difficult to break.

Major scientists in the medical and pharmaceutical community are coming out now in denial of the hoax, and Alex Jones is here to listen to them.

It will also mean that in the near future there will be a huge mismatch between the amounts of younger and older people in the country.

Indeed, by 2034 Americans over age 65 are expected to outnumber those under 18 for the first time in the history of the nation.

Unless it is stopped now, the COVID madness, the lockdowns, the panic, the social engineering will not only causing irrevocable damage to our collective psyche, societal morale, and cultural richness, it will also destroy future prosperity and literally deny life to millions along the way.

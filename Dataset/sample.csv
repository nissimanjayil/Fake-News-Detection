Seriously, what’s going on here? It’s been 15 minutes and they haven’t shown a single Volkswagen commercial. I’ve never seen any of these shows before, either. I gotta tell my buddies about this.” At press time, sources confirmed a stunned McGill had begun to question his sanity after he changed the channel and discovered a baffling program in which everyone was speaking Spanish.

497,497,Katharine Viner: 'The Guardian's reader funding model is working. It's inspiring',[],"Three and a half years ago, when I took over as editor-in-chief, we were faced with the urgent challenge of how to make the Guardian sustainable.

The situation looked bleak across the media. Print advertising was in steep decline, and digital advertising growth was going almost entirely to Google and Facebook. News organisations everywhere were searching for answers to the challenge that they were being read more than ever before, but with fewer ways to cover costs. Month by month, more and more news outlets went behind a paywall.

We realised we had to find a new way to fund Guardian journalism. The obvious answer was to go to you, our readers – at that time we had 150 million, and you have always had a special relationship with the Guardian, valuing our editorial independence, our commitment to investigative reporting, and our progressive viewpoint rooted in the facts.

We knew we wanted all of our journalism to remain global, free and accessible for our readers – and not restrict it only to those who could afford to pay for it. We wanted to give people the opportunity to contribute financially, in ways that worked for them, meaning that we could provide our readers – regardless of where they live, how much they earn or how they like to get their news – a way to support us that also tied in deeply with the liberal and progressive ethos on which the Guardian was founded.

When we asked for your support, we weren’t sure whether it would work. Both friends and competitors were deeply sceptical for a long time, but you, our readers listened and responded. It was inspiring how many of you from more than 180 countries wanted to play a role in supporting the Guardian financially.

This support has meant so much, and helps protect our editorial independence, allowing our journalists the freedom to report and investigate important stories of our time.

Your support enables us to hold technology companies to account by exposing the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Without you, it would be much harder to do this.

It is your support that means we can focus on the unfolding climate crisis impacting communities and the living planet, and commit to reporting on the environment: from the threat to public lands in the US to the drought in Australia.

Guardian readers’ support also means we can fight for justice for the Windrush generation in the UK, and hold the home secretary to account for the hostile environment policy.

To be able to announce today that we have received financial support from more than 1 million readers around the world in the last three years is such a significant step. This model of being funded by our readers through voluntary contributions, subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly, membership or as part of our patrons programme is working.

This means that within just three years, the Guardian is on a path to being sustainable. We hope to break even by April 2019. It has not been easy and we still have a long way to go – we need you to continue to support us financially, and we need more of our readers to take that step if they can. We continue to face financial challenges, but we are determined to find new ways to make meaningful journalism thrive – and with your help it will.

We are living in dangerous times when dark ideologies flourish, and it’s no surprise that people feel anxious and confused. I know it can sometimes be tempting to turn away from news coverage. But I’m sure you feel, as I do, that we have to understand the world if we’re going to have a chance of making it better for everyone.

That is what Guardian journalism is trying to do: to give you the facts so that, through clarity, we can make sense of what is happening; and to inspire you, through ideas and imagination, to find an alternative. Thank you to those who have supported us financially so far. We hope that today many more of you will consider offering us one-off or ongoing support, with a contribution or a subscription. Together, through clarity and imagination, we can make space for hope.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
331,331,"Vaccine Minister Says Bars, Restaurants & Cinemas Will Demand Proof of Vaccination Before Entry",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

UK vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi says he expects bars, cinemas, restaurants and sports stadiums to all demand proof of vaccination against COVID-19 before allowing customers to enter their venues.

Speaking with BBC Radio’s The World at One earlier today, Zahawi responded to the host’s question about immunity passports that are registered within a phone app to be allowed to enter a sports stadium or to travel.

“I think you’ll find that restaurants and bars and cinemas and other venues, football stadiums, will probably also use that system,” said Zahawi.

Zahawi went on to explain that the NHS’ ‘track and trace’ app, the use of which was implemented as a requirement to enter bars and restaurants, had set the pretext for the vaccine eventually being made mandatory to enter such venues.

In Day 2 as Vaccine Minister, @nadhimzahawi endorses the NHS App morphing into an immunity passport. Asked if “it will become virtually impossible to do anything without a vaccine”, he said “People will have to make a decision”. This misguided, chilling and wrong. pic.twitter.com/ZvYiFKiGfp — Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) November 30, 2020

“In many ways, the pressure will come from both ways, from service providers who will say demonstrate to us that you’ve been vaccinated, but also we will make the technology as easy and as accessible as possible,” he added.

The host responded by clarifying that “it would become virtually impossible to do anything if you don’t have the vaccine.”

The comment once again highlights how governments don’t need to make the vaccine compulsory by law, they will simply lean on the travel, leisure and entertainment industry to make life virtually impossible for those who refuse to take it.

By setting the benchmark that virtually any social activity will require people to take the shot, those who refuse will essentially be confined to a form of lockdown for potentially the rest of their lives.

As we previously highlighted, the airline industry is also signaling that it will mandate the vaccine in order for passengers to travel, with Qantas CEO Alan Joyce already insisting that this will be the case.

634,634,Oligarch's son flees to Russia as mother sues over 'hidden' divorce millions,[],"The son of a billionaire Russian oligarch who is being sued by his mother over claims he helped hide hundreds of millions of pounds due to her in the UK’s biggest ever divorce settlement has fled to Russia.

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad’s “lieutenant” in a scheme to hide up to £453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a £30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was “stressed and scared” about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister’s home in Russia.

“I got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams … harassing me. I’m drinking a lot,” he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: “I’m not saying I was on the streets … [But] I’m not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].” He added that he was “not hiding” in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings “way in excess” of the £3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that £3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter’s mother had become accustomed. “Now maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it’s different,” he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her £453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the £30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son’s emails.

Akhmedova’s legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband’s £300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

The case is expected to continue on Monday.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
415,415,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government’s ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It’s both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn’t necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I’ve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I’m torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year’s Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn’t going to stop transmission. It’s best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you’re likely to smell the smoke. It’s the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area – the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you’re not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they’re not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government’s decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn’t worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I’m less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
860,860,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don’t count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor’s note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board “eroded the public trust in legitimate service animals”.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people “fraudulently representing their pets as service animals”, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog’s health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned “pit bull type dogs” in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, “At this time, there are no changes to Delta’s current service and support animal policies.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1025,1025,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano’s 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier’s pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

“They’d put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,” Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado’s Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

“This is some of the worst work in the world,” said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park’s rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement – and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers’ lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill’s toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel’s Landing in Utah’s Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

“If I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out … and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,” Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill’s toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren’t cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they’re not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag – often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell – or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah’s Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won’t degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

“People are really opening up to the idea,” Henry said.

Plastic bags aren’t a perfect fix – they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don’t want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don’t have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

“Once you get eight miles into the backcountry, it’s up to you to dig a hole,” Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Duke of Sussex, 36, who lives with his family on a $14.65-million estate in California, spoke of his passion for nature and Africa during a television exchange to feature in an upcoming documentary, continuing his love of offering advice on climate matters that peaked 12 months ago with his enthusiastic endorsement of Greta Thunberg, as Breitbart News reported.

Speaking about his son Archie, now 19 months, the Daily Mail reports Harry said: “Being in nature is the most healing part of life, I truly believe that’s one reason why it’s there.”

He then said “the moment you become a father, everything really does change because then you start to realise, well, what is the point in bringing a new person in to this world when they get to your age and it’s on fire?”

Harry spoke of the importance of “putting the dos behind the says” when it comes to tackling climate change and conservation, before imploring everyone on the planet to examine their souls, musing:

Every single raindrop that falls from the sky relieves the parched ground. What if every single one of us was a raindrop, and if every single one of us cared?

Harry reflected on the “universally tough year” everyone has experienced during the coronavirus epidemic, adding he has found comfort in nature, which he believes is the “most healing part of life.”

“Someone said to me right at the start of the pandemic, ‘It’s almost as though Mother Nature has sent us to our rooms for bad behaviour’,'”he observed.

As Breitbart News reported, in September last year he stood on African soil and declared the world was in a state of “emergency” and “losing’” the battle against climate change, an event he declared that “cannot be denied.”

The Duke stressed saving the environment was a race against time, adding everyone should look to young people like Greta Thunberg for inspiration and guidance: “Led by Greta, the world’s children are striking.”

659,659,Baby God: how DNA testing uncovered a shocking web of fertility fraud,[],"At 22, Cathy Holm was newly married, settling into a new home in Las Vegas, Nevada, and struggling to start a family. It was the early 1960s, and infertility was a largely taboo topic; devoid of options, she looked up a doctor listed as a “fertility specialist” in the phonebook. Dr Quincy Fortier, a respected obstetrician who opened Sin City’s first women’s hospital, had a record of helping couples achieve a viable pregnancy, and promised to inseminate Holm with a sample of her husband’s sperm.

Decades later, in March 2018, Holm’s daughter, Wendi Babst, bought an ancestry kit to celebrate her retirement as a detective in the Clackamas county, Oregon, sheriff’s office. Like many Americans, Babst was hoping to glean a comprehensive picture of her genealogy, but she was unnerved by her DNA test results: numerous close matches, despite no known first cousins or half-siblings, and the repetition of a name she hadn’t heard of, Fortier.

The database unmasked, with detached clarity, a dark secret hidden in plain sight for decades: the physician once named Nevada’s doctor of the year, who died in 2006 at age 94, had impregnated numerous patients with his own sperm, unbeknownst to the women or their families. The decades-long fertility fraud scheme, unspooled in the HBO documentary Baby God, left a swath of families – 26 children as of this writing, spanning 40 years of the doctor’s treatments – shocked at long-obscured medical betrayal, unmoored from assumptions of family history and stumbling over the most essential questions of identity. Who are you, when half your DNA is not what you thought?

For Babst and several other Fortier relatives now connected as unintentionally uncovered half-siblings, “the idea of closure is really impossible,” Hannah Olson, the film’s director, told the Guardian. Filmed over two years, Baby God investigates how “painful and circuitous and unfinished it can be for victims of different kinds of sexual violence”.

Olson had come to know the sometimes thorny journey of uncovering genealogy well as a producer on Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates Jr, a show transformed by the advent of commercial DNA testing and the internet communities sprung from the blacklight shed on family secrets. What was once the work of combing through records – birth certificates, death certificates, hospital archives – sometimes became an inadvertent Pandora’s box of secrets. “All of a sudden it became a thing where we had to reveal to people that their father wasn’t the person they thought their father was, or their grandfather wasn’t the person they thought he was,” she said.

In the most extreme cases, such as with Fortier or Cline, there were dozens of misled offspring. The Fortier case rocked the Nevada medical establishment, but was not an isolated incident; there are at least two dozen American doctors known to have perpetrated so-called fertility fraud, such as the widely covered case of Dr Donald Cline in Indianapolis, who fathered at least 50 children through his medical practice. Fortier was likely an egregious case of physician betrayal, but far from the only one, Olson realized – “this was a phenomenon.”

Baby God initially follows Babst’s personal investigation, as she retraces her mother’s steps and requests records on Fortier, who practiced medicine for more than 60 years in Nevada, won physician of the year in 1991 and never lost his medical license. Two of Fortier’s former patients sued the doctor for fraudulently inseminating them with his own sperm in the mid-2000s, as reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal; the cases were settled out of court, allegedly with an agreement to prevent the plaintiffs from speaking publicly, and Fortier never had to admit wrongdoing (Fortier did, however, acknowledge his paternity of the four children in question in his will, and left open the possibility that more biological children would later be revealed).

That reality – a once unknowable crime now made plainly knowable – has now come to pass, and the film features interviews with several of Fortier’s previously unknown children, each grappling with and tracing their way into a new web of half-siblings, questions of lineage and inheritance, and reframing of family history. Babst, who started as a cop at 19, dove into her own investigation, sourcing records on Dr Fortier that eventually revealed allegations of sexual abuse and molestation against his own stepchildren.

Brad Gulko, a human genomics scientist in San Francisco who bears a striking resemblance to the young Fortier, initially approached the revelation from the clinical perspective of biological motivations for procreation. “I feel like Dr Fortier found a way to justify in his own mind doing what he wanted to do that didn’t violate his ethical norms too much, even if he pushed them really hard,” he says in the film. “I’m still struggling with that. I don’t know where I’ll end up.”

The film quickly morphed, according to Olson, from an investigation of the Fortier case and his potential motivations to the larger, unresolvable questions of identity, nature versus nurture. “At first it was like ‘let’s get all the facts, we’re going to figure it out, what are his motivations, it will be super clear,’” said Olson. She interviewed two former colleagues, whose cavalier, brash attitudes toward sex and reproduction – one whipped out his phone to show photos of abnormal uteruses and female genitalia nestled within his camera roll, and both seemed unperturbed by the idea of their sperm unknowingly used by Dr Fortier – make the doctor’s deception seem less like an isolated pathology and more the extreme manifestation of widespread attitudes toward female fertility: a “doctor knows best” attitude, belief that women don’t need to know, ends justified the means, coupled with the lack of frozen sperm, which didn’t become common practice until the 1980s.

But as the investigation deepened, “we ended up discovering much darker things than I imagined,” said Olson, including the alleged abuse of his stepchildren, one of whom he inseminated with his own sperm and shipped off to a Minnesota home for unwed mothers. The subsequent child, a son named Jonathan, was adopted by the Minnesota family, and appears in the film’s second half as a more recent addition to the half-siblings web. Fortier’s two youngest children, who stood by him during his trials and after his death, recall their father in the film as a kind, generous man; one daughter, Sonia Fortier, says she does not want to know if the abuse allegations were true. (Fortier denied the charges, according to the Review-Journal, and no charges were ever brought).

In the wake of DNA testing, some states have sought to enact laws specifically targeting the past crimes of fertility fraud, including Indiana, where some of Cline’s descendants have backed such legislation. But Olson sees such legislation as a distraction from the Fortier case’s larger, more unsettling questions. “Looking for answers for this kind of fertility fraud in the law is kind of misguided, because it’s always been illegal. It’s battery, it’s malpractice, you can’t put something in someone’s body without their consent,” she said. “That’s why it was more important for me to focus on the attitudes that gave way to this and the emotions.”

“Towards the end, it became about making peace with one’s parents, and does it matter what our parents have done? Does DNA matter?” The sliver of a phenomenon captured in Baby God takes a “very bizarre case” to “illuminate something that may be universal,” she said. “We’re all just trying to make peace with our parents.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

650,650,‘Our customers want us to go green’: the rise of sustainable hair salons,[],"Small changes such as eco shower heads can make big saving for salons. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn’t something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. “I think it was my children,” he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. “As they’ve gotten older, they’ve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.”

In the salon’s new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There’s a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He’s also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he’s already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there’s been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. “It’s added a real buzz to the salon,” he says. “[Clients] feel they’re doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what’s going on [in the world].”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. “A big turning point was David Attenborough’s The Blue Planet,” she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. “I had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‘Our customers want us to go green.’”

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than £5,000 a year. “There are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we’ve found a lot of win-wins,” Baden says. “[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients’ behaviour. They’re connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.”

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai Görlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel’s brands. “We truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,” he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, Görlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf’s Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children’s Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. “Hairdressing is a skill, a craft – it’s teachable,” Ellis says. “So we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.” Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. “She ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‘You’ve changed my life.’ It’s wonderful.”

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. “I felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.” Many will go on to set up their own businesses – Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

“He said that it’s such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,” Görlitz says of Son. “In 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.” And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, Görlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel’s Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. “Shaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.”

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he’s felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. “For the first time ever, we’ve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That’s incredible. There’s been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
846,846,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC’s decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn’t need any “verification” from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O’Sullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

“The shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,” a BBC spokesperson said. “On this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.”

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

“This is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards,” he wrote. “I know who I am and what I’ve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don’t vote.”

Fury’s initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury’s team offered a farmer £25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4 — TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 2, 2020

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements – citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury’s team to lie. Fury’s subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as “total bullshit”.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury – who earlier that year had claimed that “there are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.”

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn’t changed his mind. “I didn’t enjoy it one bit,” he wrote. “I turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

98,98,"Exclusive — Blackburn: ‘Vital’ that Georgians Reelect Loeffler, Perdue to Protect Senate ‘Firewall’ Against Left",['Matthew Boyle'],"Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) told Breitbart News exclusively that the upcoming U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5 represent a “classic battle between freedom and socialism.”

Sens. David Perdue (R-GA) and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) will face off against Democrats Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock respectively for both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats and potentially control of the majority in the U.S. Senate at stake. Republicans will definitely have at least 50 seats in the Senate next year, and Democrats will definitely have at least 48. If the Democrats were to take both of these seats, then the Senate would be tied at 50-50 and whoever the vice president of the United States is next year would cut the tie and determine the majority control in the Senate.

Since Democrat presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden currently leads in enough states to win the electoral college, that would probably be now-Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA)—his running mate—should challenges from President Donald Trump fail. If Trump were to succeed in his election challenges, then Vice President Mike Pence would cut ties in the Senate. But as it stands now, barring a miraculous legal challenge comeback by Trump, in a 50-50 Senate it would be Harris cutting ties and steering control of the upper chamber of Congress to the Democrat Party.

Blackburn argued in an appearance on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM 125 the Patriot Channel that the Democrats would use victories in these Georgia Senate races if they got them to implement a radical leftist and socialist agenda.

“What you have is a classic battle between freedom and socialism,” Blackburn said. “Chuck Schumer has said, in his glee on Election Day, he said first we go ‘take’ Georgia—not we go earn the vote, not we work in Georgia to win, but ‘take.’ They are planning, the left is planning to ‘take’ Georgia. Then Schumer said they will ‘change’ America. The ‘change’ they are planning for America is adding justices to the Supreme Court, changing the Supreme Court, giving statehood to D.C. Now, D.C. is not as big as Atlanta, but D.C. is going to be a state if the Democrats get their way. Statehood for Puerto Rico, and making sure they take health insurance away from 153 million Americans and 57 million Medicare enrollees and putting everyone into a Medicaid-style program that is run by the government. They want to implement the Green New Deal, and they want to give felons the right to vote—and that is the plan just for their first 100 days. This is what they are going to do if they are given the opportunity. Bear in mind what they plan to do is use Georgia and then force their will not only on Georgians but also on the American people.”

Blackburn urged all Republicans and Trump supporters to get out and vote for Perdue and Loeffler, saying it is “vital” for them to do so since the “left is organized” in a systemic way to try to manufacture wins for Ossoff and Perdue.

“It is absolutely vital,” Blackburn said when asked how critical it is for Trump supporters to back Loeffler and Perdue. “The left is organized because they cannot get by with implementing all the stuff they’re wanting to foist upon Americans unless they win Georgia. The Senate has been the firewall. They’re the ones that have blocked a lot of stuff. It is so important that we make certain that we carry these races in Georgia. I guarantee you I am going to be out there working every single day—night and day—to make certain that we win these races. You just think about the people who would be heading these various committees. Do you really want Bernie Sanders chairing the Senate Budget Committee? Do you really want somebody like Elizabeth Warren leading the Senate Armed Services Committee? Do you really want someone like Dick Durbin as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee? Most Georgians would say no I’m not comfortable with that because these are individuals who are too far left for me. So the only thing that stands between that happening and not is for the people of Georgia to go elect Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue.”

Pence is headed back to Georgia on Friday, and Trump is heading there on Saturday, to campaign with Loeffler and Perdue. Several other top GOP stars have already been to the state and more are planning trips there over the next month.

In fact, this open-world RPG from CD Projekt Red is probably one of the things that has kept you going through this tough year. But we need to just come clean and get this off our backs: Cyberpunk 2077 is not a real game. It was just something we made up to sound cool and interesting in front of you so you would like us and now that lie is spinning completely out of control.

Please don’t hate us.

Now, we’re sure your mad. We know you were counting down the days until you could explore a fully realized Night City as part of the ultra-customizable gameplay you’ve been seeing in hands-on videos for months. But it’s a lie. It’s all a goddamn lie and we’re sorry. We just really like when you hang out on the site, and we wanted you to stick around. That’s why we made it up way back in 2012 and got the developer to play along.

This started as a dumb little fib about something we thought you would like and now it’s become this huge weight on our chest, getting heavier and heavier every day. We just couldn’t keep it down anymore without having a panic attack.



We know what you are thinking. The screenshots? The previews? Our art department created it all. We thought we could keep up the charade for a year or two more with a trickle of delays and impressions about the gangs, the dynamic police system, all of it. But in the back of our heads, we always knew that one day, you would expect this game to come out and we would be caught.

Some of this is on you. Why do you think it’s been delayed so many times? We flirted with the idea of canceling it all together, saying CD Projekt Red had gone bankrupt or something. But then we would have never been free from the manacles of this lie.



We were just insecure, you know? There are so many video game sites out there and we’ve always kind of felt like outcasts. Talking about Cyberpunk was the first time we ever really felt like we were part of something, like you actually wanted to hear what we had to say. In a way we wanted it to be real—the customizable weapons and slow-motion combat sequences. It all sounded so cool and we didn’t want to let you down. Please don’t blame us. After all, our intentions were good.

We did this for you, even if we only ended up hurting you.

To be fair you probably should have figured it out years ago. The idea of a sci-fi shooter from the makers of The Witcher series was always a bit of a wish fulfillment fantasy wasn’t it? Obviously, we’re not trying to absolve ourselves of this. But we kind of assumed you would catch on when we claimed Keanu Reeves was going to be in the game. That doesn’t make any sense if you just think about it for a second. But we just blurted it out a few months ago, and then all it took was hiring him for a few press appearances and we were in the clear again.

At least, until now.



So, listen, what we are trying to say is: We’re very sorry. This video game is never going to come out. It doesn’t ev en exist. Of course, we understand if you never trust us again to deliver honest coverage of the industry. On the plus side, getting this all out there makes us feel like we can finally breathe again without hating ourselves. We’re sure you’ll need some time to process this, and we could use a little time to ourselves to figure out why we’re like this.

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Demand for coronavirus tests raises concerns over HIV and malaria Read more

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

“There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.”

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 – from 80,000 to 500,000 every year – when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

“But it is malaria that can explode the fastest – it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‘canary in the coalmine’ that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.”

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia’s interest.

And a similar proportion – 56% – believe that if Australia doesn’t support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

“The Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

“As a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.”

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

“Australians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours … indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.”

Australia's Covid vaccines: everything you need to know Read more

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia “should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs”.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia’s vaccine plan.

“Does Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?” national director Sam Klintworth wrote. “This equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.”

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should “explicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia”.

President Trump gave his first post-election interview to Maria Bartiromo on her Fox News show Sunday Morning Futures. During the phone interview, the president attacked the mainstream media for its refusal to run negative stories about Joe Biden, calling it “suppression by the press.”

“We don’t have freedom of the press in this country. We have suppression by the press. They suppress,” the president said. “You can’t have a scandal if nobody reports about it. This is the greatest fraud in the history of our country, from an electoral standpoint.”

Jimmy Kimmel used the Fox News interview to mock Bartiromo, calling her “always sycophantic” when it comes to the president.

“I don’t know what happened to her, but she appears to be auditioning for the position of Donald Trump’s next wife because that was some interview,” he said.

Watch below:

Speaking of sycophantic, Kimmel recently interviewed former President Barack Obama, gushing over the former commander in chief by asking a series of softball questions to promote Obama’s new memoirs, A Promised Land.

During Monday’s show, Kimmel also mocked the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, saying that he has always hated the annual holiday tradition “I hate parades. To me, it’s just traffic with balloons.”

474,474,'Worst work in the world': US park rangers grapple with tide of human waste,[],"For 20 years, Richard Lechleitner had a grueling task at Mt Rainier national park: digging human waste out of backcountry toilets and carrying it down the mountains.

Staff at the park in Washington state grappled with an influx of visitors hiking far from roads, along with thousands of climbers attempting to reach the active volcano’s 14,000ft summit each year. People heeded the call of nature on Mt Rainier’s pristine glaciers, as well as in its unvarnished wilderness toilets.

“They’d put in these horrible toilets that just smelled terrible,” Lechleitner said. Maintaining them, he found, was appallingly dirty work.

At national parks across the US, from the peaks of Denali in Alaska to desert backpacking destinations in Utah and Arizona, managers have struggled to deal with this inevitable byproduct of people eager to get outdoors, a desire that continues amid the pandemic. Unlike a discarded Clif Bar wrapper, human waste carries a slew of bacteria and pathogens when left unbagged or otherwise unaddressed.

Colorado’s Rocky Mountain national park has been hit especially hard. There, a surge in visitors meant toilet paper became a more common sight in wilderness areas, rangers told the Guardian. But the park is now known nationally for pioneering a solution used at other sites, including Mt Rainier.

Between 2016 and 2019, the 265,000-acre park near Denver saw a 40% increase in visitors hiking and climbing its woods and jagged peaks. In 2019, it was the third-most visited national park in the US.

More hikers than ever were flocking to Longs Peak, a sheer 14,000ft mountain near the continental divide. The main trail attracts thousands of people each day during the summer, but around the mountain there are just four toilets, spread miles apart. That leaves hikers with limited options.

By 2015, rangers were trekking to the toilets and finding repulsive conditions. At its worst, the solid matter would freeze and thaw repeatedly and rise above the seat. Rangers would have to dig the material from the chamber and load it into a five-gallon bucket, place the cargo on to a pack animal and ride down.

“This is some of the worst work in the world,” said Geoff Hill, a toilet entrepreneur who worked with the park’s rangers as a doctoral student studying backcountry waste.

Because the toilets were in such a sordid state, many hikers probably refused to use them, opting instead to dig a shallow hole or cover their business with a rock.

Human pathogens can sully streams and harm high-altitude denizens, such as marmots. The beaver-like creatures would sometimes become stuck inside the toilet chambers and covered in waste, according to park staff.

Park chiefs poured time and resources into a solution. They settled on a nifty toilet product that Hill designed, called ToiletTech.

The system separates urine from solid waste, which creates cleaner excrement – and less work for rangers. Beneath the toilet seat, excrement lands on a small conveyor belt, while urine flows through a separate pipe and into a septic field. When a visitor presses a foot-powered pump inside the bathroom, ordure travels from the conveyor belt into its own chamber. There, it remains dry, lightweight and free of viruses usually present in a wet barrel of urine-soaked waste.

The new facilities, which replaced the four toilets near Longs Peak, have since helped cut down on solid matter in the area and made rangers’ lives much easier, although 200mph winds once blew the doors off a unit in the Boulder Field area.

Land managers have installed Hill’s toilets across the country to rave reviews, from Angel’s Landing in Utah’s Zion national park to Terwilliger Hot Springs outside Portland, Oregon, as well as at Mt Rainier.

“If I was to win the lottery, I literally would go out … and buy enough toilets to work in all of the backcountry camps at Mt Rainier,” Lechleitner said of the new design.

But even Hill’s toilets come with drawbacks. Waste from remote areas is still flown out by helicopter, which is expensive. Lechleitner also said the ToiletTech units aren’t cheap, at $4,000 per unit, and National Park System maintenance upgrades are notoriously backlogged.

Mt Rainier is a petri dish for experiments in another, cheaper method of waste control: requiring climbers to carry their own excreta off the mountain when they’re not near bathrooms.

Land managers will either supply visitors with a kind of plastic bag – often containing an inner lining that seals and neutralizes some of the smell – or ask that they bring their own.

Merely asking hikers to carry their waste has helped protect Coyote Gulch, a maze of narrow canyons swarmed with backpackers in Utah’s Glen Canyon national recreation area, and other popular canyons. The dry environment means waste won’t degrade easily there, and the remote region only has one toilet, said the ranger Steve Henry.

“People are really opening up to the idea,” Henry said.

Plastic bags aren’t a perfect fix – they have to be incinerated at a cost to already cash-strapped agencies, or tossed in a landfill. And people generally don’t want to carry their own feces for days on end.

If a bathroom is still miles away and hikers don’t have a carry-out bag, the best thing they can is tote a trowel to a spot far from streams and trails, said Ben Lawhorn, director of education and research for the outdoor ethics group Leave No Trace.

“Once you get eight miles into the backcountry, it’s up to you to dig a hole,” Lawhorn said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
579,579,War crimes: former minister reveals why Canada disbanded its special forces after scandal,[],"A former Canadian defence minister who disbanded his nation’s special forces regiment in the wake of a war crimes scandal similar to that now facing Australia says the drastic step was the only way to fix systemic cultural problems and repair reputational damage.

The parallels between Canada’s so-called Somalia affair and the allegations against Australian troops in Afghanistan are striking.

The Somalia affair involved soldiers from Canada’s elite Airborne Regiment, who were revealed to have tortured and killed a 16-year-old Somali boy, Shidane Arone, in 1993, during the United Nations peacekeeping mission in the war-torn nation.

The Canadian soldiers took horrific “trophy” photos posing with Arone, which sparked national outrage and shocked Canadians, and helped prompt a wide-ranging inquiry and the subsequent revelation of separate videos showing soldiers making racist comments and taking part in brutal hazing rituals.

Like the Brereton inquiry, Canada’s own war crimes probe found systemic cultural and organisational problems afflicted the Airborne Regiment.

David Collenette became Canada’s defence minister in 1993, replacing his conservative counterpart, as the nation continued to grapple with its response.

In 1995, after the emergence of the videos, Collenette decided to disband the Airborne Regiment, transferring its three parachute battalions into other regiments.

Such a move is not being contemplated by the Australian Defence Force or the Morrison government.

In an interview with the Guardian, Collenette explained that he had come to the conclusion that disbanding the regiment and starting from scratch was the only way to address the deep-seated problems that had led to the affair.

Collenette – who was at pains not to tell Australia what course it should take – said that in Canada’s case, the cultural problems were so great that repair or reform of the special forces regiment was not an option.

“I’m not saying that just because Canada did it, other countries have to follow our lead,” he said. “But if you’re looking at the experience that we had, where there were … war crimes that ended up in convictions, and that it revealed a systemic problem with the institution from which the individuals came, then it seemed reasonable that, if you didn’t think you could really change the culture, then you needed to take a fresh start, which is what we did and it’s actually worked out.”

The disbandment of the Airborne Regiment was complemented by a suite of organisational and cultural reforms, recommended by the inquiry, which helped modernise the Canadian military.

“In a way the military still had a mentality that had been shaped in two world wars and Korea, and the Cold War, and we didn’t seem to have adapted to the changing global focus of conflict,” Collenette said.

He said Canada’s approach – disbandment coupled with major organisational reform – has been “very successful”.

No Canadian government – conservative or liberal – has attempted to re-establish the Airborne in the 25 years since, and Canadian soldiers have been deployed to high-intensity theatres, including Afghanistan, without any further allegation of war crimes.

Collenette said the disbandment decision was simply the only option that he was left with.

“It was very shocking to, obviously, the senior members of the military, defence staff, and the chief of the army and others,” he said. “But frankly, I think there was a feeling within the armed forces that something drastic had to be done, because there was a taint on the entire institution, which was unfortunate because like Australia, we had a great record in peacekeeping, we’d fought in world wars, and we’d never had anything like this.”

But Collenette offered a note of optimism. The Somalia affair is widely considered one of the darkest chapters in Canadian military history and seriously damaged its reputation as a peacekeeping force.

“Even when things seem to be broken, if you will, or a real challenge, you can make changes and you can turn the ship around,” Collenette said. “We did that, and in our case we made a certain decision on the Airborne Regiment, and that seems to have been accepted and it’s 25 years after the fact.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
751,751,Canadian security firm GardaWorld raises G4S takeover offer to £3.7bn,[],"Investors have two weeks to decide whether to accept final offer of 235p a share in cash

A Canadian security firm has increased its takeover offer for the UK outsourcing group G4S to £3.68bn in a final bid for its larger rival.

GardaWorld said it would pay 235p a share in cash, up 24% from its previous 190p-a-share offer, which would value G4S at £3bn. The Canadian firm has also reached a deal with G4S pension trustees on a £770m funding package for the pension scheme.

After rejecting the offer made in September, G4S said it was looking at the higher bid with its financial and legal advisers, and urged shareholders to take no action.

It added that it also remained in talks with another suitor, Allied Universal, after it rejected a £3.25bn approach last month. Allied has until 9 December to make a formal offer.

Shares in G4S rose 7.5% to 246p on Wednesday .

GardaWorld’s chief executive and founder, Stéphan Crétier, said: “Shareholders have a simple choice: remain invested in a company which has consistently failed them and the wider community for so many years, or realise their investment in cash, at a significant and highly attractive premium.

“G4S needs an owner-operator that understands the people-orientated nature of the sector with the resources, time and expertise to solve the many challenges faced by the business.”

G4S investors now have until 16 December to decide whether they want to accept GardaWorld’s final offer.

Last month, G4S said it would start paying a dividend again and claimed the group could reach revenue growth of between 4% and 6% a year if it remained independent.

But the firm reported a £91m loss for 2019 after it was forced to write down the value of its cash handling business. It has also announced plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs to reduce costs.

Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets, said: “G4S management have been pushing back for some time against GardaWorld; however, with Allied Universal Security also lurking in the background, G4S shareholders are likely to find this new offer compelling, especially since the shares are up over 50% since the initial September bid.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

'We expected to go back in days': Karabakh truce means exile for some, homecoming for others

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan’s parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan’s soldiers reached the settlement’s outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

“We expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,” Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. “Nobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,” Safaryan says.

Nagorno-Karabakh: Azerbaijan troops begin retaking land from Armenia Read more

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

“When we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,” Hajiyeva says. “Even after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‘We’ll be back soon.’ It never happened.”

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a “war generation”: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

“I was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,” she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. “Geographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,” she says. “The feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.”

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. “Armenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,” Safaryan says. “We had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn’t trustful coexistence.”

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. “I asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,” she says. “Later we learned it was about unification with Armenia.”

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. “We said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,” Hajiyeva says. “We even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.”

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. “Slowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,” she says.

“One day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,” Hajiyeva recalls. “After that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.”

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. “I opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,” she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family’s home. “My parents just woke up and realised war had begun.”

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. “Some days they couldn’t even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,” Safaryan says. “They were very bad, very harsh days.”

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan’s favour.

“The whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,” she claims. “They left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.”

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh’s Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan’s parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. “They are just existing,” she says. “We are trying to figure out what we are going to do.”

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. “Some people were saying, why have you left your city?” she recalls. “They were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.”

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. “The house has survived the occupation,” he says. “I have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what’s happening in my city.”

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. “My friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,” he says. “But I’ve always prepared myself that once I’ll be back in Shusha, I’ll start my new life from zero.”

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. “I cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,” Hajizada said. “It is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.”

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. “I feel like I’m nobody now,” Safaryan says.

“Everything I was living and fighting for – making plans for big projects in Hadrut and every village and city in Artsakh – and now there’s nothing. Nothing to fight for, and nothing to live for.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the Senate majority leadership within his reach, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” Now Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick are reportedly the latest Hollywood celebrities to lend their star power to Democrats in Georgia, hoping to boost the chances of candidates Raphael Warrnock and Jon Ossoff and turn the Senate blue.

The acting power couple will join comedian Billy Eichner and Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr. in a fundraiser for Swing Left, one of many progressive organizations that is mobilizing Democratic turnout in Georgia, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The Maze Runner producer Ellen Goldsmith-Vein will co-host the December 3 event.

Swing Left is among the many progressive groups that have set their sights on Georgia ahead of the state’s January 5 runoffs. The organization, which was founded in the wake of President Trump’s 2016 victory, has specialized in recruiting celebrities to push its agenda, including Broadway and Homeland star Mandy Patinkin.

Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick teamed up with Swing Left in the weeks leading up to the presidential election, participating in podcasts and donating money to the group.

Hollywood celebrities have made Georgia their top political priority in their effort to push Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock across the finish line. A-list stars including George Clooney and Will Smith have poured money into the races, while actors Kumail Nanjiani and Sophia Bush are spearheading WinBothSeats, an initiative to get out the minority vote for Democrats.

Julia Louis-Dreyfus is holding a Veep reunion next month to raise money for America Votes, the left-wing group that is working to boost Democratic chances in Georgia’s runoffs. Other stars pushing Georgia Democrats on social media include Alyssa Milano and Debra Messing.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

It said the pandemic had already triggered “unprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour” and warned of a new wave of criminal activity “in relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines”.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs “plan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives”, the Interpol secretary general, Jürgen Stock, said.

“It is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,” he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of “unauthorised and falsified” coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

862,862,Oligarch's son flees to Russia as mother sues over 'hidden' divorce millions,[],"The son of a billionaire Russian oligarch who is being sued by his mother over claims he helped hide hundreds of millions of pounds due to her in the UK’s biggest ever divorce settlement has fled to Russia.

Temur Akhmedov is being pursued by his mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, in the high court over allegations he acted as his father Farkhad’s “lieutenant” in a scheme to hide up to £453m awarded to her in a 2016 divorce.

The 27-year-old, who owns a £30m apartment in the exclusive London development One Hyde Park, had promised the high court he would fly to London from another luxury home in Dubai to attend the hearing. However, when the case got under way on Wednesday it was revealed that he had flown to Russia over the weekend.

Temur Akhmedov told the court he had fled to Russia because he was “stressed and scared” about the prospect of returning to London, and had instead sought refuge at his sister’s home in Russia.

“I got stressed, [and] I got scared. People are using surveillance teams … harassing me. I’m drinking a lot,” he said via video link.

The eldest son of Vladimir Putin ally Farkhad Akhmedov, Temur said he did not have access to enough money to pay for a place to stay in London, despite allegedly having a personal fortune worth tens of millions of pounds. He said he was unable to live at his One Hyde Park apartment because he had used it as collateral for a loan to pay his legal fees.

He said: “I’m not saying I was on the streets … [But] I’m not going to call my mum [and ask] can I live with you [when she is suing me].” He added that he was “not hiding” in Russia.

He told Mrs Justice Knowles he would return to London soon to give evidence in the trial.

He said he had not been able to agree terms on a loan to pay for his legal team, which is being run by the media lawyer Mark Lewis, so he intended to represent himself in the trial and would be expected to cross-examine his mother.

Alan Gourgey QC, who is representing Tatiana Akhmedova, suggested to the court Akhmedov probably still had access to significant funds, and that he was the registered owner of a Rolls-Royce with a personalised number plate and a Tesla car.

Gourgey said there was evidence to suggest that Akhmedov was continuing to live a very lavish lifestyle, adding that invoices and WhatsApp messages suggested outgoings “way in excess” of the £3,000 a week spending limit imposed by the court.

Akhmedov had said earlier that £3,000 a week was not enough to maintain the lifestyle to which he, his daughter and his daughter’s mother had become accustomed. “Now maybe for the average person that seems like a fucking crazy amount but in reality it’s different,” he said last week.

Akhmedova alleges that her Azerbaijani-born Russian husband transferred cash and assets to their son in order to avoid paying her £453m awarded by a London divorce court in 2016. Both men deny the claims and say Akhmedova was aware of the father-to-son gifts, which included the £30m apartment, at the time.

In her quest to uncover the award, she has won court orders to raid the apartment to search for evidence, and to force Google to hand over the contents of her son’s emails.

Akhmedova’s legal team, which is being funded by the litigation financier Burford Capital, had at one stage attempted to seize her former husband’s £300m superyacht, which had been built for Chelsea football club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, and has 10 VIP cabins and a 20-metre swimming pool.

A huge art collection, including pieces by Mark Rothko, Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, are also contested, as well as a helicopter and private jet.

Oof. We really don’t know what to make of this.

See, Mr. Miyamoto, the legendary game designer for Nintendo, was originally scheduled to give a presentation on the main stage earlier this week. As abiding fans of everything he’s contributed to the history of video games, we were all really excited by a rumor that he might be making a big announcement about an upcoming Mario game. He didn’t show up, though, and we didn’t hear anything from him or his representatives about where he was. Ultimately, we assumed he had canceled due to an illness.

Flash forward to today, spectators at the Cyberpunk 2077 demonstration noticed an unhealthily obese, middle-aged Japanese man standing completely still in the middle of the Marvel’s Avengers tent, emptily staring at an exit sign. We didn’t recognize him at first, but after taking a second look, we realized, dear God, that’s Shigeru Miyamoto, and he looks like he’s in horrible shape.

What the hell is going on, gamers?

Our first concern wasn’t that he had missed delivering Monday’s exclusive OGE Nintendo Direct. The more pressing thing was that Miyamoto appeared to be eating from a three-pound sack full of pistachios while repeatedly muttering the word “liars” under his breath in a near-catatonic state. His shirt is completely stained and rumpled, and, well, let’s just say he doesn’t smell great. It’s like a combination of rubbing alcohol and really badly burnt clay—it makes you gag a little just getting a whiff from far away.

After overcoming our distress, we tried to approach the designer behind The Legend Of Zelda and Super Mario and ask what he thought of the conference, and he just said, “Maybe I will—maybe I fucking will—see how they feel about it” before wandering off to the Epic Games booth, where he’s now just glaring at Tim Sweeney and breathing loudly. We’re really scared, and we’re not sure why.

Readers, should we call an ambulance or something?

Either way, we’ll keep an eye on him for you, and let you know if there are any updates. Suffice it to say, it doesn’t look like we’re getting bonus DLC for Super Mario Odyssey or a new 3DS version of Mario Party anytime soon, and what this means for the future of Nintendo in the next generation is anyone’s guess.",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
383,383,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from António Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes … Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.”

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible – and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump’s vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

“Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,” he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. “It must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.”

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. “This is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test … We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable – even in rich countries – were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Niña weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: “I firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year – the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.”

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to “flick the green switch” while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days’ time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: “We need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.”

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. “Next year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,” he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. “There is no vaccine against climate warming,” he warned. “But there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.”

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

“Money, money, money,” said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. “The question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.”

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK’s spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host’s leverage in bringing developing countries together.

“A country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,” she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
821,821,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the “certain knowledge” that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that “the scientists have done it”, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with “over-optimism”, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: “We’re no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.”

He added: “We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.”

There were still “immense logistical challenges”, he said. “So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it’s all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we’re not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.”

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning’s press conference announcing the vaccine’s approval. “And what a momentous … journey and international effort it has been,” Van-Tam said. “Discovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.”

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. “If we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‘Oh, the vaccine’s here, let’s abandon caution,’ all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.”

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a “complex product” and “really tricky to handle”, explaining: “It’s not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.”

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was “going to eradicate coronavirus ever”, but we may get to the point where it becomes “a seasonal problem” like flu. He added: “Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party … and say, ‘That’s it, it’s behind us,’ like the end of the war? No, I don’t.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

Protesters gathered in front of a dark, grey house with a sign on the door warning trespassers to keep out, the Salem Statesman Journal reported.

The house is owned by a safety and health enforcement manager who worked for the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Administration.

Organizers of the rally accused the manager of being the inspector who deemed Courthouse Club and Fitness to be unsafe.

“If you’re in that house, we’re asking you to stand with the people … because if you don’t stand with us, we’re going to go through some real difficult times,” protest organizer Joey Gibson said.

Brown’s order made it a requirement for gyms and fitness centers, as well as other businesses, to close between November 18 and December 2 to respond to and stop the rising level of coronavirus cases.

Courthouse Club Fitness stated in a now-deleted post on its Facebook page that it would remain open and received a $90,000 fine just more than a week later.

State health officials said the fine was calculated from the citations of each of the four fitness clubs’ facilities.

“The total penalty for each individual inspection is $22,500,” said Mark Peterson, acting spokesman for OSHA. “That’s a willful penalty of $17,500 for being open to the public and a separate $5,000 penalty for violating the Red Warning Notices that we posted at each location late last week.”

97,97,Judge Orders GA County to Stop Software Update on Voting Machines,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A U.S. district judge issued a federal court order to stop officials in Georgia from performing a software update that would “wipe” or “reset” Fulton County voting machines, according to the order, which was shared by attorney Lin Wood.

The attorney added that the order was later “reversed” when a judge deemed Georgia counties to be in control of the voting machines.

“Time to obey the law. Stop the destruction of evidence,” tweeted Wood at several Georgia officials on Sunday, sharing an image of the federal court order.

“Plaintiffs contend that union county officials have advised that they are going to wipe or reset the voting machines of all data and bring the count back to zero on Monday, November 30,” the court order stated. It went on:

To the extent Plaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order to preserve the voting machines in the State of Georgia, and to prevent any wiping of data, their motion is granted. Defendants are ordered to maintain the status quo and are temporarily enjoined from wiping or resetting any voting machines in the State of Georgia until further order of the Court.

The order was signed by U.S. District Judge Timothy C. Batten on Sunday.

“Our Republican recount monitors at the World Congress Center waited today for four hours while Fulton County elections officials ‘updated the software,'” tweeted the Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, David Shafer.

“The explanation given to me – ‘just the usual Fulton County incompetence’ – is completely unacceptable,” Shafer added.

“Thankfully [Lin Wood] this afternoon obtained an emergency federal court order prohibiting any ‘wiping’ or ‘resetting’ of the voting machines,” continued Shafer in a follow-up tweet.

Wood is the Georgia-based attorney most famous for successfully suing the media on behalf of Richard Jewell in the 90s, as well as on behalf of Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann last year.

“It is outrageous that we cannot rely on Fulton County elections officials to do their jobs without unexplained four hour delays, interventions by private attorneys and federal court orders,” Shafer added.

The court order, however, was apparently rescinded, as Wood later announced in a follow-up tweet that a judge had reversed the federal order based on the Defendants’ claim that Georgia counties control voting machines.

“What??? Judge reversed order based on Defendants’ claim that GA Counties control voting machines,” wrote Wood. “Machines are owned by State & [Georgia Secretary of State] administers state laws on elections.”

“Why are GA officials determined to wipe these machines clean be resetting them?” the attorney inquired.

“On November 24, a litigation hold notice was served on Fulton County which demanded that all evidence related to voting machines be preserved,” explained Wood in another tweet.

“Scrubbing the machines or tampering with them in any manner should NOT be occurring,” he declared.

710,710,Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans,[],"Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a “super-spreader event”.

The gathering, called “Naughty in N’awlins” saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event’s organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

“If I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,” Hannaford wrote.

“I wouldn’t do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.”

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N’awlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

“When we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,” Hannaford said.

“In almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‘Fuck it, it’s our last day’ and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.”

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

“We did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‘No Dancing’,” he said.

“But you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn’t really outlaw dancing.

“But seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

“People bounced and moved by their tables, and even though people were more spread out, I saw a lot more eye contact and positive acknowledgment of short flirts and teases.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

James’s agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James’s contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year’s NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The contract extension, once it is made official, will guarantee James career earnings of $429m.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
633,633,"Covid could derail efforts to eradicate malaria in Pacific, health experts warn",[],"The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

“There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.”

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 – from 80,000 to 500,000 every year – when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

“But it is malaria that can explode the fastest – it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‘canary in the coalmine’ that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.”

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia’s interest.

And a similar proportion – 56% – believe that if Australia doesn’t support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

“The Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

“As a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.”

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

“Australians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours … indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.”

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia “should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs”.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia’s vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

“Does Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?” national director Sam Klintworth wrote. “This equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.”

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should “explicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia”.

Last month, a panel of UN public health experts urged governments not to hoard vaccine supplies and called on pharmaceutical companies to share technologies and expertise so all countries can access treatments equally.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

577,577,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain’s hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

“I’m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,” he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: “I want to make sure we’re going to fight like hell by investing in America first.” He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America’s domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden’s priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his “goal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China’s abusive practices – that’s stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations” and forcing “tech transfers” from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. “The best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our – or at least what used to be our – allies on the same page. It’s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.”

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: “Look, there’s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.” He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal “with the nuclear programme”.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. “And the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,” he said.

Then, Biden added: “In consultation with our allies and partners, we’re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.” He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal – France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China – to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

391,391,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has condemned the behaviour of MEP József Szájer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Szájer’s participation in a “gay orgy” in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

“What our representative, József Szájer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,” said Orbán on Wednesday evening. He said Szájer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orbán’s government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Szájer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary’s constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

Right-wing Hungarian MEP resigns for attending 'sex party' that broke Belgian lockdown Read more

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium’s coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Szájer’s resignation. “He made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,” it read.

Prior to Orbán’s intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

“Mr Szájer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,” said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Szájer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region’s deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him “fleeing along the gutter” to escape the raid.

Szájer admitted he had been at a “house party” but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Szájer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an “open secret” among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Szájer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. “I always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something – just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,” he said. He added that guests had been “completely naked” at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Szájer for possession of drugs. But the “gay orgy” element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Szájer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Szájer boasted that he had drafted Hungary’s new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as “a 21st-century constitution” when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Szájer said: “It depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don’t think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.”

In the intervening decade, Orbán’s government has gone further in its “traditional values” drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed “too gay” for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orbán’s government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, “the mother is a woman and the father is a man”. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government’s justification for the amendment explained that “new, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development”.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Szájer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making “a huge political deal out of a sex scandal” and praised Szájer’s statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary’s government.

452,452,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world’s coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world’s biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries – Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal – will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction – known as exclusive economic zones – are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: “Humanity’s wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.”

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: “Australians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods … When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.”

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world’s oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was “a really big deal” and could restore the health of the world’s oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

“What you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it’s not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant – business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,” she said. “The oceans are in a very sorry state right now.”

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. “We are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.”

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: “If we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.”

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of “ghost” fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a “circular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of “dead zones” from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik Österblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: “[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.”

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world’s oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: “The UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1013,1013,Coming unstuck: can glue that lets go solve the global packaging problem?,[],"There are few things in life as ubiquitous as glue. It is so ever-present as to be almost invisible. Actually, most of the time, it is. It holds our furniture together, keeps nappies on babies and false eyelashes on lids. It bonds together parts of aeroplanes and cars and is used for almost every type of packaging you can think of: cardboard boxes, jar labels and all manner of plastic wrapping.

And yet, when it comes to responsibly disposing of packaging, the key property of glue – its stickiness – is its fundamental flaw. Although usually no more than 5% of the total weight of packaging, adhesives can cause challenges at the recycling stage. With the packaging recycling target at 70% in the UK for 2025 – the 2020 target is 60% – it’s vital that technologies and systems are developed to ensure these targets are met, not least by making sure that packaging is designed with recycling in mind. And that includes looking at the role of adhesives.

As consumers become increasingly aware of humankind’s environmental footprint, and pressure grows for companies to devise solutions in line with a circular economy, scientists and researchers in labs globally are taking a completely fresh look at packaging design.

Graham Houlder, project coordinator for the pan-European project Ceflex, a consortium of companies working towards the sustainable design and recycling of flexible packaging, says: “The issue with adhesives and recycling is that the chemistries of some of those adhesives can create quality issues when you recycle.”

One particular problem is that of flexible packaging, which in the UK has one of the lowest recycling rates.

So what is flexible packaging? Sadly, the type that often ends up in the bin. It’s things such as cat and baby food pouches, and toothpaste tubes – generally, anything that doesn’t spring back to its original shape when twisted or bent. This kind of packaging is likely to be made from layers of different materials held together with adhesive, making them difficult to recycle.

Houlder says that, in the past, flexible packaging was less of an issue as the UK was able to meet its recycling target without including this difficult-to-recycle packaging. “It costs more to collect, sort and recycle flexible packaging than it does a big, rigid milk bottle so, in the interests of keeping costs down, the UK decided that they wouldn’t collect and sort it,” he says.

Although many European countries do collect flexible packaging, analysis by the BBC found that only 7% of UK households could put plastic pouches out for recycling, while 73% of food tubs can be collected.

Ceflex’s goal is for there to be an established collection, sorting and reprocessing infrastructure for flexible packaging across Europe by 2025. Some of the targets set out in the UK’s circular economy package – an action plan that ensures waste and resource use are minimised, and when a product reaches the end of its life, it is used again to create further value – will mean that more of the plastic we normally throw away should go for recycling instead, although there is a lot to be done before we get there. A target of 65% of household waste recycled by 2035 has been set, while the current target stands at 50%.

So how is industry helping to prevent packaging from going to landfill? It’s all well and good to have higher recycling targets, but products must be designed so that they can be recycled.

In three years, a system called extended producer responsibility (EPR) will come into force in the UK, which will require producers of plastic to pay fees to cover its responsible disposal. Houlder hopes we’ll see a change for flexible packaging then. “When the EPR system is launched in 2023, we’re hoping flexible packaging will be collected and sorted,” he says.

So while the UK lags behind many other European countries in this regard, this gives us a small grace period to ensure that when we do introduce widespread collection of flexible packaging, it won’t be for nothing.

One company on the case is Henkel, the consumer goods company behind such household names as Schwarzkopf and Pritt, and a founding partner of Ceflex. One of its three business units centres around the development and production of adhesive technologies. “What we’re doing is establishing a set of adhesives that are optimised for recycling, both for things that have been recycled for a long time – let’s say cardboard – and also for plastics,” says Dennis Bankmann, senior manager circular economy at Henkel Consumer Goods and Packaging Adhesives.

Several of Henkel’s projects involve creating, ironically, a glue that can unstick. Houlder recalls a meeting he had with Bankmann a few years ago when such a concept was bandied around. “I said to him: ‘Why can’t you make an adhesive that, under certain conditions, just lets go and we separate the two incompatible materials in the recycling process?’ He said he’d worked for Henkel for 10 years and no packaging manufacturer had ever asked him to make an adhesive that lets go!”

The future of packaging: can a shift in product design end the plastic waste crisis? Read more

But today, that is exactly what they have created. Henkel has joined up with the recycling technology startup Saperatec, which has designed a process for recycling flexible packaging that has an aluminium layer – often found in pet food pouches or bags for coffee beans. Bankmann says that in Germany, where flexible packaging is collected for recycling, typically only the aluminium portion of the packaging could be recovered, not the plastic.

Saperatec’s technology means both the aluminium and plastic layers of your coffee bean bag can be recycled, and the glue holding these layers together is optimised for this process. Effectively, it debonds so the layers can come apart. “The debonding allows you to recover more [materials],” Bankmann says. “It will really be the first commercial operation of this kind in Germany.”

The adhesives developed with Saperatec’s recycling technology in mind is part of Henkel’s RE range, adhesives designed specifically with a view to recyclability, either through their compatibility with recycling, ability to debond, or enabling innovative designs.

Henkel has also developed, as part of its EPIX technology platform, materials that function beyond bonding, used primarily with paper-based products. Henkel recently launched the EPIX mailer that does not have an inner plastic lining, and is curbside recyclable. The EPIX material provides a protective layer that allows the paper pulp to recover during recycling. Additional products from the EPIX range could also be applied to things such as paper, cups or food wraps, to replace alternatives that sometimes have a plastic layer or are plastic themselves, and therefore cannot be recycled. Functional properties of EPIX materials, including thermal insulation and barrier properties, make them an attractive swap.

Choosing a paper-based product with such functional properties, for example a paper mailer that does the same job as one lined with plastic bubble wrap, could be a smart choice in places such as the UK where paper is commonly collected for recycling. And when can we see a wider range of materials collected, specifically soft plastics? Houlder points out that in order for 65% of household waste to be recycled by 2035, flexible plastics will need to start being collected. “As the targets go up and we’re increasingly circular and trying to stop the leakage [of plastic] into nature and the ocean, you have to collect and sort flexible packaging,” he says.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

878,878,‘Our customers want us to go green’: the rise of sustainable hair salons,[],"Small changes such as eco shower heads can make big saving for salons. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn’t something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. “I think it was my children,” he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. “As they’ve gotten older, they’ve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.”

In the salon’s new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There’s a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He’s also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he’s already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there’s been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. “It’s added a real buzz to the salon,” he says. “[Clients] feel they’re doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what’s going on [in the world].”

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. “A big turning point was David Attenborough’s The Blue Planet,” she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. “I had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‘Our customers want us to go green.’”

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than £5,000 a year. “There are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we’ve found a lot of win-wins,” Baden says. “[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients’ behaviour. They’re connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.”

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai Görlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel’s brands. “We truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,” he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, Görlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf’s Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children’s Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. “Hairdressing is a skill, a craft – it’s teachable,” Ellis says. “So we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.” Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. “She ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‘You’ve changed my life.’ It’s wonderful.”

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. “I felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.” Many will go on to set up their own businesses – Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‘As consumers we all have tremendous impact’: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge Read more

“He said that it’s such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,” Görlitz says of Son. “In 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.” And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, Görlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel’s Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. “Shaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.”

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he’s felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. “For the first time ever, we’ve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That’s incredible. There’s been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
261,261,Why Central Bank Digital Currencies Are a Bad Idea,[],"Central bank digital currencies (CBDC) are being sold with the narrative of protecting consumers who are increasingly moving to cashless payments.

Some say that these cashless payments will rob us of the privacy advantages of cash while exposing us to bank runs, payment network blackouts, and foreign financial adversaries.

Yet while these risks are real, they would be negligible had it not been for the central banking and financial regulators’ interventions into the market. CBDCs make these interventions worse and introduce some new, much bigger ones.

Design Implications

While the stated intention behind CBDCs is to keep the commercial banks in the picture, these digital currencies will bring their end users closer to the central banks. This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single common ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and, e.g., change the inflation rate.

A permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn’t provide the immutability feature, but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than it has right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.

Helicopter Money

The reason why we’ve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable, and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.

Economists of the Austrian school understand that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo-)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.

The problem is that the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy that hasn’t fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn’t brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels. Needless to say, commercial banks’ cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn’t align well with the central bank’s goals either. During the covid crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation. Since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn’t—capital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers.

With closer integration of the monetary spigot and the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit or just outright cash-outs to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply “airdropping” new tokens to the existing users. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture—they would still serve as custodians of the token keys and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.

This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks’ dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists have had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure. And while monetary overdoses such as we’ve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don’t perform well, as Japan’s three lost decades of Bank of Japan (BOJ) interventions have demonstrated.

Negative Interest Rates

Hoarding is evil—or so the modern monetarists’ narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings are just money that doesn’t work in spurring the miracles of spending- and money supply–driven economic growth. Negative interest rates, then, are potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding—by incentivizing savings account holders to spend their depreciating balances. Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on to their customers, but commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative-yielding accounts to interest-yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.

With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly to their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would certainly increase the consumers’ and businesses’ propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people tried to offload their cash savings. But to think of this as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe will lead to a different, let alone better, outcome is ludicrous.

Financial Surveillance

The final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people’s privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that a branch of government that imposes KYC/AML rules on existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch nonviolent “criminals” cares about our privacy is laughable.

They’re not even hiding the fact that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call “data analytics.” To think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be naïve.

It’s not a coincidence that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to a government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.

Pro-CBDC Arguments Are Misleading

The proponents of the central banking tokens argue that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country’s payment network. While such a risk exists—for example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors (as it used to) and as a result Visa and Mastercard were pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country—if it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.

If anything, the biggest attacks on monetary exchange in the Western world have come from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises, as was the case in Cyprus or Greece (not to mention that central banks themselves caused those crises with their credit bubbles of the preceding periods).

The argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn’t pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.

CBDCs Will Come and Will Make Things Worse

In conclusion, the reasons why central banks champion CBDCs are the strongest reasons for which people should oppose the transition toward them.

274,274,Thousands of Protesters March in France Against Draconian Security Law That Bans Filming Police,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Protesters throughout France have shown up for rallies against a controversial draft law on public safety, under which filming a police officer on duty may result in a hefty fine. Critics say it fosters impunity for misconduct.

The protests were organized in many large French cities, including Paris, Marseilles, Lyon, Brest and Nice, with thousands participating despite Covid-19 concerns. The main event is happening in the Place de la République in the capital.

The demonstrators are voicing their anger over a draft law on public security, which was approved by the lower chamber of the parliament this week. Article 24 of the bill bans filming of police officers on duty with an intention to harm them. Lawmakers who voted for the bill are among the officials who were shamed by the protesters.

The reasoning behind the provision, which introduces a fine of €45,000 ($53,450) or even a one-year jail term, is that members of the force need to be protected from doxxing and online harassment. Critics say it curtails journalistic freedoms and would be used to intimidate people who want to expose police brutality and other forms of misconduct.

The protests were organized by unions, but they have many supporters. The Yellow Vests movement, which was sparked by growing social and economic inequality and for months remained a major problem for President Emmanuel Macron, is among them.

There is also a component of racism in why the proposed law sparked so much anger. Police abuse of people of color became more visible thanks to the spread of mobile phones with good cameras and social media.

593,593,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the “certain knowledge” that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that “the scientists have done it”, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with “over-optimism”, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: “We’re no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.”

He added: “We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.”

There were still “immense logistical challenges”, he said. “So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it’s all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we’re not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.”

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning’s press conference announcing the vaccine’s approval. “And what a momentous … journey and international effort it has been,” Van-Tam said. “Discovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.”

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. “If we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‘Oh, the vaccine’s here, let’s abandon caution,’ all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.”

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a “complex product” and “really tricky to handle”, explaining: “It’s not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.”

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was “going to eradicate coronavirus ever”, but we may get to the point where it becomes “a seasonal problem” like flu. He added: “Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party … and say, ‘That’s it, it’s behind us,’ like the end of the war? No, I don’t.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

743,743,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel’s parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday’s vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz’s Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday’s bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country’s longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

“Netanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,” Gantz said. “Show me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country’s budget.”

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: “Netanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.”

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. “Now is not the time for elections,” Netanyahu said. “Now is the time for unity.”

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

“I was well aware of his track record as a ‘serial promise-breaker’, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn’t happen,” Gantz said on Tuesday.

“Netanyahu didn’t lie to me – he lied to all of you.”

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

“Netanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,” Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

“[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,” wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

“The prime minister’s ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

839,839,"I never thought I was a chess person. Then Covid came, and I've found the game cathartic",[],"Back in April, months before Netflix’s series The Queen’s Gambit caused a sensation and a run on chess sets, I started playing chess with an app on my phone. This was a strange thing for me to do, since I had never thought of myself as someone who would ever be good at chess. Every time I’d ever played anyone, I’d lost almost immediately, coming away feeling frustrated and dumb. I guess I liked to think it was because I’m more of an intuitive, right-brained person, not a plotter or a planner. And so I avoided chess for most of my life. But something about April, with Covid-19 raging and New York City on lockdown, sent me into the battlefield.

I’d never really realized before that it is a battlefield. Playing chess is like being thrust into an episode of Game of Thrones. As I lay in bed at night, unable to sleep, anxious and fearful about the plague that was whipping through the city, taking the lives of thousands and then tens of thousands, I was advancing across the field like a wildling wielding its spear. Sometimes, in my imagination, I was Boudicca, the legendary, first-century redheaded Celtic queen who waged war against the Roman invaders. I loved hearing the thunk of the app when my piece would land, taking out an adversary. Chess is combat. And it’s exhilarating.

Playing chess has made me think a lot about my brother Danny, who died of an epileptic seizure in 2005, at age 46. I feel like I’ve come to know Danny better in the last few months than I ever did when he was with us. Danny was a high school chess champion. From the ages of about 14 to 18, he was obsessed with chess. Every day he would come home from school and sit down in his room with his friends Eric or Hugh and play intense games of chess with an accompanying chess clock. I would hear them banging the clock and screaming at each other – sometimes argumentatively, sometimes joyously. I just thought they were weird. They were weird. They were brilliant boys, nerdy, intellectual. At Danny’s funeral, which was held in Florida (where we were born and raised, though he spent most of his adult life living in LA, where he worked in the film industry), many people talked about how Danny was the smartest guy they’d ever known.

But it isn’t always easy being that smart. Danny had a rather hard life, and I can see now that high school was probably especially hard for him. He was different. He was skinny. He had a terrible case of acne. He was constantly battling with our father, who was maddeningly critical of him, often for no good reason. (In many ways, they were much alike.) Chess, I see now, was Danny’s escape. In chess, he no longer had to be the difficult boy he was – he was a knight, a king. He was winning. He was powerful. And he became so through using his wonderful brain.

After I’d been playing chess for a few months – first against the app, and then against the anonymous players you can connect with online – I felt like I was ready to play an actual person in real life. I’d started to win! (Well, some of the time.) So I asked my daughter, who is 20 and lives with me, to sit down for a game. She beat me in four moves. I was astonished! How did I still suck so bad? But I also felt a little twinge of pride, and thought about how funny my brother Danny would have found the whole thing. He’s the one who first taught me how to play chess, though he soon grew impatient with my hopelessness. Now, we often play together, my daughter and I, and sometimes I tell her about my brother Danny, remembering all the things he taught me. It’s a nice way to spend quarantine.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
212,212,"Report: ‘Smart’ Doorbells Sold on Amazon, eBay Filled with Security Vulnerabilities",['Lucas Nolan'],"A recent report states that a number of “smart” doorbells featuring microphones and cameras sold on Amazon and eBay come stocked with a number of security vulnerabilities.

CyberScoop reports that the U.K.-based security company NCC Group and consumer advocacy group Which? have discovered major security vulnerabilities in 11 “smart” doorbells sold on Amazon and eBay. One major flaw could allow a remote attacker to break into the owner’s wireless network by swiping login credentials while another critical bug could enable attackers to intercept and manipulate data on the network.

The investigation of the devices found that many doorbells made by obscure vendors that received top reviews on Amazon and eBay were extremely vulnerable. Researchers believe that many of the devices store sensitive data including location data and audio and video captured by the doorbell’s camera on insecure servers. One device made by a company named Victure sent a user’s wireless name and password, completely unencrypted, to servers in China, researchers reported.

Amazon said in a statement that it requires products sold on its site to be compliant with applicable laws and regulations and that it has tools to detect and prevent “unsafe or non-compliant products from being listed in our stores.” eBay said that it takes down listings that violate its safety standards but that the devices flagged by researchers did not meet the company’s threshold. A spokesperson for the doorbell manufacturer Victure denied that the company sent usernames and passwords to Chinese servers.

Matt Lewis, the research director of the project, said that his team’s findings indicate “a wider culture that favors shortcuts over security in the manufacturing process.” Other research found that home-networking devices ranging from routers to webcams also suffer from major security vulnerabilities.

Last week, the U.S. Congress passed long-awaited legislation that would set security requirements for Internet of Things (IoT) vendors that contract with the U.S. government.

461,461,‘Our customers want us to go green’: the rise of sustainable hair salons,[],"Small changes such as eco shower heads can make big saving for salons. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn’t something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. “I think it was my children,” he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. “As they’ve gotten older, they’ve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.”

In the salon’s new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There’s a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He’s also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he’s already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there’s been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. “It’s added a real buzz to the salon,” he says. “[Clients] feel they’re doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what’s going on [in the world].”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. “A big turning point was David Attenborough’s The Blue Planet,” she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. “I had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‘Our customers want us to go green.’”

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than £5,000 a year. “There are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we’ve found a lot of win-wins,” Baden says. “[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients’ behaviour. They’re connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.”

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai Görlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel’s brands. “We truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,” he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, Görlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf’s Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children’s Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. “Hairdressing is a skill, a craft – it’s teachable,” Ellis says. “So we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.” Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. “She ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‘You’ve changed my life.’ It’s wonderful.”

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. “I felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.” Many will go on to set up their own businesses – Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

‘As consumers we all have tremendous impact’: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge Read more

“He said that it’s such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,” Görlitz says of Son. “In 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.” And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, Görlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel’s Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. “Shaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.”

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he’s felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. “For the first time ever, we’ve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That’s incredible. There’s been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

904,904,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire – photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria’s 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: “Walking through the remains of Europe’s biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.”

A Valentine’s Day mug. Valentine’s Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

“Between the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone’s home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.”

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

“The owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.”

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

“This is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.”

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child’s shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered “a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence”.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the “bribery-for-pardon schemes”, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the “subject or target” of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. “Pardon investigation is Fake News!” he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: “It’s hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‘bribery-for-pardon schemes’ is.”

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro tweeted: “In 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day – but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton’s use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a “pre-emptive pardon”. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: “People shouldn’t presume – and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

“It may be someone that we’ve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn’t have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.”

189,189,Biden's Top Economic Adviser Tied to Delphi Pension-Slashing Scheme,['John Binder'],"Democrat Joe Biden’s pick to be his top economic adviser in the White House served on the Obama-appointed team that helped slash pensions for roughly 20,000 Americans in the auto bailout.

This week, Biden announced that Obama alum Brian Deese, now an executive at the investment management firm BlackRock, will serve as his top economic adviser should he enter the White House.

Deese previously served as a special assistant to Obama for economic policy and played a role in the administration’s bailout of the auto industry, which ultimately led to slashed pensions for 20,000 non-union workers at the Delphi Corporation, an auto parts supplier to General Motors (GM).

In 2009, as part of the Obama-Biden administration’s taxpayer-funded bailout of GM, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) terminated the pension plans of non-unionized Delphi workers. In some cases, workers had their pensions gutted by as much as 75 percent.

A federal report in 2013 detailed that the Delphi workers would likely have their pensions cut by an estimated $440 million. Meanwhile, GM topped off unionized Delphi workers’ pensions at a cost of about $1 billion.

Deese, along with agency heads like Timothy Geithner and top advisers like Ron Bloom, was named in that federal report, having had been involved in multiple conversations about the Delphi pensions:

In July 2009, internal Government emails between the Auto Team and Advisor to the President Brian Deese discussed GM’s need to address issues with Delphi’s “splinter unions.” Auto Team officials did not recall details related to the emails. When Senator Charles Schumer took a position that GM should assume the Delphi salaried retiree pensions, Mr. Deese emailed Mr. Rattner this “may complicate the optics of doing anything for the splinters.” Other emails from Mr. Deese stated, “We will continue to face intense scrutiny on this issue. The politics of terminations is quite intense” and “we need to work on a clear rationale for the outcomes we’re moving toward, as well as an explanation of respective roles.” Mr. Rattner emailed members of the Auto Team that he had spoken with Fritz Henderson about “our logic on the splinters, which he [Henderson] was fine with. [Auto Team Analyst] Sadiq [Malik] should speak to Janice [Uhlig] about the details, particularly how the reallocation of the $417mm would work.” Auto Team member Feldman emailed members of the Auto Team about health care/pension benefit changes for IUE and USW employees, and Mr. Deese responded that the company’s organizing principle was parity between GM salaried and non-UAW hourlies. Mr. Deese referenced a discussion about health care costs and the “credible fairness arguments to augment the hourlies’ recovery based on the pension disparity, but that for all the reasons we discussed that would not be possible. However, I think the logic of that conclusion strongly counsels in favor of bringing the top-up through. Otherwise, we’re moving in the opposite direction from a position that we all agreed was itself on the edge of fairness.”

In October, President Trump signed a memorandum to devise a plan to restore the pensions of the Delphi workers. Biden has not said if he supports the memorandum.

Former Delphi workers told Breitbart News in interviews how the pension-slashing scheme uprooted their livelihoods. One retiree said she lost her home, and her retirement plans to move to the Florida coast have been squashed.

Another retiree said his wife died in the process, as he was forced to find work in order to pay for her medical bills. He had assumed that after 30 years at Delphi, he and his wife would have a good healthcare plan in their retirement. That ended when his pension was cut by about 30 percent.

Delphi, which has since split into Aptiv and Delphi Technologies, announced in 2006 that it would shutter 21 of its 29 plants in the United States — offshoring some 20,000 U.S. jobs to Mexico, China, and other foreign countries.

At the time, Delphi employed nearly 50,000 Americans, who earned about $30 an hour on the assembly line. Now, workers in Mexico for the company earn about $1 an hour.

141,141,Music Festivals Offer to Put on Mass Vaccinations in Belgium,['Breitbart London'],"BRUSSELS (AP) – With nothing on their agendas for months to come, music festival organizers in Belgium want to use their know-how to help the country’s coronavirus vaccination campaign.

The Belgian government has set a goal of vaccinating about 70% of the country’s population, about 8 million people, when approved COVID-19 vaccination shots become available.

As the vaccines are expected to arrive in multi-dose vials for shots to be administered all on the same day, Belgium health authorities are planning to vaccinate people in groups as much as possible. The task will pose many logistical challenges, including the creation of vaccination centers that festival organizers say they can help set up.

Enjoying a strong reputation in the music world, Belgian festival experts have proven experience in both building huge pop-up structures and in crowd management.

With the music industry hit hard by the pandemic’s economic, several festivals in the French-speaking region of Wallonia and the Brussels area have created a federation to better defend their interests. They have a large network of technicians who are currently unemployed and are ready to help out.

“Our sector has been at a standstill for many months, and our many staff are eager to bring their creativity and dedication to the fight against coronavirus,” said federation president Damien Dufrasne.

One of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, Belgium has reported some 577,000 confirmed cases and more than 16,500 deaths linked to the virus.

Last week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said COVID-19 vaccinations could start in the European Union’s 27 nations before the end of December. The commission, the EU´s executive arm, has agreements with six potential vaccine suppliers and is working on a seventh contract. The deals allow it to purchase over 1.2 billion doses, more than double the population of the EU.

Dozens test positive for Covid after swingers convention in New Orleans

Forty-one people have tested positive for coronavirus after attending a swingers convention in New Orleans, in what officials have called a “super-spreader event”.

The gathering, called “Naughty in N’awlins” saw about 250 people congregate in the city in mid-November. It went ahead despite cases rising in Louisiana at the time.

One of the infected swingers was hospitalized in a serious condition, according to the event’s organizer, Bob Hannaford, who addressed the outbreak in a blogpost.

“If I could go back in time, I would not produce this event again,” Hannaford wrote.

“I wouldn’t do it again if I knew then what I know now. It weighs on me and it will continue to weigh on me until everyone is 100% better.”

NOLA.com reported that the Naughty in N’awlins event was much smaller than in previous years. About 2,000 people attended in 2019, and roughly 250 made the trip this year.

In his blogpost Hannaford said social distancing was enforced at the swingers convention, and contact diaries were kept.

He said attendees were tested for coronavirus before arriving, and 50% already had antibodies.

Hannaford attributed the outbreak to complacency as the multi-day event drew to a close.

“When we contacted the people that were positive, we asked them several questions to find more potential positive cases and try to find out where the biggest risks took place,” Hannaford said.

“In almost every case, they admitted to us that they were super diligent on the first two days (Wed and Thurs) and then they relaxed a little on Friday and then they said ‘Fuck it, it’s our last day’ and many admitted that their lax effort on that final day is probably why they ended up positive.”

Swingers were given color-coded wristbands based on whether they had antibodies or did not, and Hannaford said other measures were also taken.

“We did not install a dancefloor, because the city protocols say ‘No Dancing’,” he said.

“But you see, I saw Footloose, so I knew that you couldn’t really outlaw dancing.

“But seriously, there never was a packed dancefloor like most of our events.

“People bounced and moved by their tables, and even though people were more spread out, I saw a lot more eye contact and positive acknowledgment of short flirts and teases.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

823,823,"UK put speed before public confidence in vaccine, says EU agency",[],"The European Medicines Agency has suggested British regulators prioritised speed over winning public confidence to enable the UK to become the first western country to license a coronavirus vaccine.

After it was announced that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had been authorised for emergency use by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), the EU agency issued a statement backing its own “robust” approach.

In a series of media appearances on Wednesday morning, the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, erroneously claimed that emergency authorisation had been possible “because of Brexit”, contrasting the UK approach with the “pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly”.

The EMA said the bloc’s member states had the option of taking the same emergency authorisation route but that its own process was the “appropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens’ access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns”.

Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track authorisation chosen by the UK and allowed under EU law, but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

“The idea is not that we’re the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,” he said.

Spahn said Germany wanted all European countries to be able to roll out the vaccine at the same time. “We have member states, including Germany, who could have issued such an emergency authorisation if we’d wanted to,” he said. “But we decided against this and what we opted for was a common European approach to move forward together.”

The EMA’s statement said its conditional market authorisation, involving extra checks and evidence gathering, included “essential elements to ensure a high level of protection to citizens during the course of a mass vaccination campaign”.

The agency said its assessment would be concluded by 29 December at the latest and that the differences in timings between the UK and EU authorisation “are not expected to affect significantly vaccines’ availability”. The emergency authorisation approach is limited to specific batches of vaccine, limiting the supply.

Alok Sharma, the UK business secretary, claimed the authorisation was a British success story. “In years to come, we will remember this moment as the day the UK led humanity’s charge against this disease,” he said.

The comments drew an angry response from Germany’s ambassador to the UK, Andreas Michaelis, who tweeted: “Why is it so difficult to recognise this important step forward as a great international effort and success. I really don’t think this is a national story. In spite of the German company BioNTech having made a crucial contribution, this is European and transatlantic.”

Speaking after a meeting of EU health ministers, Spahn said: “We may have read some comments on Brexit: BioNTech is a European development funded by the European Union and it shows that a product from the European Union is so good that it is authorised so quickly in the UK, that in this crisis what is best is European and international cooperation.”

The EMA started its rolling review of preliminary data from Pfizer/BioNTech trials on 6 October. The UK regulator launched a similar process on 30 October but came to a swifter conclusion by analysing less data.

The former head EMA Guido Rasi told Reuters: “If you evaluate only the partial data as they are doing they also take a minimum of risk. Personally I would have expected a robust review of all available data, which the British government has not done to be able to say that without Europe you come first.”

June Raine, the head of the MHRA, defended its decision. “The way in which the MHRA has worked is equivalent to all international standards,” she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
660,660,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It’s the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It’s now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it’s honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It’s a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum’s executive director.

“Even though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,” said Horsford. “It can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.”

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. “They think, oh we’re in the north, that wasn’t an issue here,” she says. “From my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it’s a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.”

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. “People who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don’t say much more,” she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it’s a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

“We wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we’re talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,” adds Horsford. “We never want to say: ‘these people were just slaves,’ because there’s so much to the story than just that.”

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm’s former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

“I wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today’s generations, are human,” said Black. “That’s something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.”

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

“We must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,” said Black. “Not just select people.”

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the “front parlor”, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information “relating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room”, said Sydlowski. “These images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.”

Sydlowski’s work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, “created specifically for those who were enslaved”, she said. “The parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.”

It captures an ongoing battle. “New York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,” said Sydlowski. “My installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.”

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

“Highlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,” said Prevost.

“Today, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,” she adds.

“Following our recent election, we’ve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

The health secretary asserted on Wednesday morning that “because of Brexit” the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so.

However, the government announcement of the decision said it had taken place under a provision of the Human Medicines Regulations, passed in 2012, which permits the rapid licensing of medicines in the event of an emergency such as a pandemic.

The UK is still under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws also allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

At a government briefing about the UK’s decision to become the first country to license the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for emergency use, the head of the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA), which made the decision, cited EU rules. “We have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January,” said June Raine, the MHRA’s chief executive.

Timeline UK Covid-19 restrictions: the key political dates ahead Show Hide Here are some of the key dates ahead for the UK's Covid-19 restrictions. The current lockdown in England ends, and the new strengthened tier system comes into force with nearly 99% of England headed for the strictest two tiers. Only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are set to go into tier 1, with more than 32 million people in tier 2 and more than 23 million in the toughest tier 3. New restriction come into force in Wales. Pubs, restaurants and cafes will be banned from serving alcohol, and will be unable to open to customers beyond 6pm. Businesses can offer a takeaway service after 6pm, and if they have an off-licence can sell takeaway alcohol up until 10pm. Bingo halls, bowling alleys, soft play centres, casinos, skating rinks and amusement arcades will also have to close. The rule allowing four people from four different households to meet indoors in pubs and restaurants will stay in place. The decision will be reviewed on 17 December. Ministers will consider data about England's coronavirus cases weekly throughout the tiers period, while legislation requires a formal review of tiering allocations every fortnight. The first review point is 16 December, with new tier allocations announced the following day – decided by a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister. They will come into effect on Saturday 19 December, Boris Johnson said. For five days over Christmas there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a 'bubble' so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together. In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries. Johnson has announced a “sunset” clause on the tiered restrictions in England, meaning they will expire on 3 February and require MPs’ approval if they are to be extended into March.

Asked about the contradiction between these comments and Hancock’s stated view, Boris Johnson’s spokesman pointedly declined to back the health secretary.

“I think the important point is that we are the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, thanks to the hard work of the MHRA,” he said, when asked whether Hancock had been correct to credit Brexit.

Pressed repeatedly on whether No 10 agreed with Hancock, the spokesman said only: “As I’ve said, it’s clear that we’re the first country in the world to approve this vaccine, and it’s obviously incredibly positive news.”

The health secretary made the claim in an interview with Times Radio, saying one reason for the quick approval was the MHRA’s “great job of working with the company to look at that data as it’s come through and do things in parallel, rather than one after the other as they normally would”.

Hancock continued: “The second reason is because, whilst until earlier this year we were in the European Medicines Agency, because of Brexit we’ve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly.

“We do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they’re done because of Brexit.”

The Liberal Democrats said Hancock had been playing “fast and loose with the facts” over the vaccine. The party’s health spokeswoman, Munira Wilson, said the claim “is not only fanciful, but shows his desperation to try and point-score, no matter how ridiculous it makes him look”.

The ability for the UK to approve the vaccine before the EMA falls under section 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, which also allows for medicine approvals in the event of emergencies, not only in pandemics but also in the event of nuclear or chemical contamination.

In October, Hancock’s department updated the regulations to boost the MHRA’s ability to push through vaccine approval.

A government source said that while such a route would have been open to other EU states, the UK was focused on non-EMA approval as “part of wider conversations” about the MHRA’s lead role in medicines regulation after Brexit, and that this most likely speeded up the vaccine approval process.

The EMA’s role in UK regulation will not fully end on 1 January, as its approvals will still be valid in the UK for two more years, as well as those made by the MHRA.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

83,83,El Paso Mayor Attributes Coronavirus Spike to Shopping at Large Retailers,['Hannah Bleau'],"El Paso Mayor Dee Margo (R) is attributing the recent spike in cases of the Chinese coronavirus to individuals shopping at large retailers during a Sunday appearance on CBS News’s Face the Nation.

On Monday, the City of El Paso, Texas, reported 461 new cases of the Wuhan virus, bringing the cumulative total to 86,172 cases:

To date, 47,397 residents have recovered from the virus and 37,267 cases remain active. For more information and other data visit https://t.co/ZQYzXomtTr — City of El Paso (@ElPasoTXGov) November 30, 2020

On Sunday, the city’s mayor attributed the spike in cases to people experiencing “COVID fatigue.”

“We hit, oh, about almost six weeks ago, we started spiking significantly. I think people just— the consensus is people just had COVID fatigue and they let down, as Dr. Birx said, you got to wear the mask and you’ve got to maintain the distancing and you’ve got to avoid the crowds,” he said, detailing the “deep dive” officials conducted into their contact tracing for the week spanning November 10 through November 16.

The investigation found that “55 percent of the positives were coming from shopping at large retailers, what we’d term as the big box stores,” according to the mayor:

And those are considered essential under CISA guidelines under homeland security. And we don’t really have- I don’t have any control over any limitations there. We’ve asked for voluntary limitations and Wal-Mart and several others are starting to meter, meaning they’re going to limit the occupancy of their- of their stores, which we think- we also dug up the fact that previously our- over 52 percent of our positives were coming in the ages of 20 to 39. Now it’s 30 to 50. So we’re just trying to maintain, but recently, and I’m- I’m fearful to even mention it, we’ve started to seem like we’re starting to maybe plateau. On Thanksgiving Day, we had 406 positives. The next day was 678.

CBS News’s Margaret Brennan asked Margo what other action he could take in light of the fact that big box retail stores, which officials say are contributing to the spread of the virus, are considered essential.

“I know you just said that you can’t shut down big box stores because they’re deemed essential,” Brennan said.

“But at a certain point, because of what you’re talking about, if people aren’t taking personal responsibility for themselves and their own behavior, do you as mayor need to shut down what businesses you can?” she asked.

The mayor explained that he “took action” to close down restaurant bars at 9 p.m., but Brennan noted that restaurants, as well as other stores, remain open.

“We were seeing a lot of congregating there. And so we shut them down at 9:00 p.m. for in-dining,” the mayor said.

“The state of Texas allowed bars to convert to restaurants with food trucks, kind of a — some of them were kind of gaming the system, we think, and there was a lot of congregation there,” he continued, switching focus to private gatherings:

But, you know, when we look at the Rio Grande Valley and Hidalgo County, which went through a spike just before ours, we talked to their health department. What they discovered in their contact tracing was the majority of their positives were coming from- from home gatherings. And that’s- that’s also still problematic here. I mean, we’re- we’re a multigenerational community and family is big– and there’s travel to Mexico. There’s also those issues.

Similarly, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has also placed an emphasis on private gatherings, reporting that 65 percent of all cases are traced to gatherings of that nature.

“This is where the spread is coming from. It’s a small gathering spread. We have to communicate this now to people the way we communicated masks,” he said during Monday’s press conference.

“Seemingly the safest place — my home my table my family. Yeah, even that place is not safe,” he added.

El Paso made headlines earlier this month over the mobilization of the Texas National Guard, which was tasked with “support[ing] the moratory affairs in the region”:

447,447,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"Lawyer earns the UK’s Blueprint for Free Speech whistleblowing prize for his efforts exposing Australia’s spy operation in Timor-Leste

The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste’s fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world’s poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Witness K and the 'outrageous' spy scandal that failed to shame Australia Read more

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share £12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

“I’m honoured and privileged and I’m going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,” he said.

“The rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I’m deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.”

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery’s story as “extraordinary”.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

“It’s a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,” she said. “One of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

Witness K is in the dock but institutions vital to Australia’s democracy are on trial | Ian Cunliffe Read more

“Today the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

“However, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

“Bernard Collaery’s story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers’ lawyers are now being targeted.”

Collaery and Witness K’s cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

The council warned that the laws were protecting “broadly defined national security at the expense of the rights of the accused”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
828,828,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite – it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It’s the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I’ve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I’ve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali’s fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis’ days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone’s view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn’t show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I’d show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn’t have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist – but it was the same exclusive he’d just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy – most photographers don’t hang around the magazine’s photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn’t mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali’s head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali’s next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you’d ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there – I went with him once. They’d wind him up saying: ‘You’re not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!” He’d reply: “No way, I’d have had him in two rounds!”

I can count on one hand the athletes I’ve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson’s disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: “Oh, that’s the greatest picture!” But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, “that’s the greatest picture!” He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist’s ear – but it was the same exclusive he’d just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We’d do a studio shot and he’d say “I’ll give you 20 minutes” – then an hour later he’d still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better – maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I’ve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

861,861,"Covid could derail efforts to eradicate malaria in Pacific, health experts warn",[],"The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Professor Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.

“There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.”

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, cases numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 – from 80,000 to 500,000 every year – when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.

Crabb said malaria, HIV, TB and maternal and child healthcare were all at serious risk as already-fragile healthcare systems in developing countries struggled to respond to Covid-19.

“But it is malaria that can explode the fastest – it is a very real threat in and of itself and it is also the ‘canary in the coalmine’ that indicates when we again have health problems in our region.”

With a number of potential Covid-19 vaccines across the world in phase three trials, a majority of Australians want the government to provide Covid-19 vaccines to countries across the Pacific and south-east Asia, a new poll shows.

Polling from Essential Media shows 55% of Australians either somewhat agree or strongly agree that funding the distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine to the Asia Pacific was in Australia’s interest.

And a similar proportion – 56% – believe that if Australia doesn’t support countries in the Asia Pacific region with major issues such as Covid-19, it risks rival nations like China becoming too influential.

Australia has been preeminent in providing medical and financial support to Pacific countries impacted by the novel coronavirus pandemic, or whose economies have suffered because of Covid-19 border closures. China, by contrast, has made significantly smaller aid contributions.

Fifty-seven per cent of people agree the Australian economy cannot fully recover until trading partners in the region have got Covid-19 under control.

Beyond the health impacts of Covid-19 and efforts to distribute vaccines around the world, chief executive of Results International (Australia), Negaya Chorley, said Australia was surrounded by nations that will struggle with the secondary impacts of the pandemic.

“The Gates Foundation has estimated that the developing world lost 25 years of progress in just 25 weeks in 2020. The pandemic will leave a profound mark on developing countries which will be felt for years to come.

“As a result of Covid-19, TB, HIV and malaria rates are all set to rise, along with child and maternal mortality.”

Chorley said beyond the moral case for Australia supporting its neighbours, there were economic and political arguments for broad and sustained regional intervention.

“Australians see the benefit in supporting our neighbours … indeed we are ready to put our neighbours not just in the queue but at the head of the queue.”

The Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, said last month the agreements Australia had signed with vaccine manufacturers would allow it to donate vaccines to countries in the Pacific and south-east Asia “should these vaccines prove safe and effective, and units are available above domestic needs”.

Australia has established a $300m Covid-19 response package to assist with economic and social recovery in the Pacific region and contributed $80m to the international Covax facility to assist high-risk populations in developing countries get vaccines.

Amnesty International Australia has written to Hunt over Australia’s vaccine plan.

The Australian government has ordered 33.8m doses from Oxford/AstraZeneca, 51m doses of the University of Queensland/CSL vaccine, 40m doses of the Novavax vaccine, and 10m doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

“Does Australia need 134.8m doses for a population of 25m people?” national director Sam Klintworth wrote. “This equates to more than five doses per person. It is projected that most of the vaccines will require two doses.”

Klintworth argued the region needs certainty, and that Australia should “explicitly state how many vaccine doses are likely required and that will be made available to partners in the Pacific and south-east Asia”.

Last month, a panel of UN public health experts urged governments not to hoard vaccine supplies and called on pharmaceutical companies to share technologies and expertise so all countries can access treatments equally.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
939,939,Joe Biden warning dashes UK hopes of early US trade deal,[],"Britain’s hopes of securing an early trade deal with the US have been dashed by a warning from Joe Biden, the president-elect, that America will not sign a trade deal with anyone until the US has sorted out its competitiveness.

Britain had been closing in on a trade deal with the administration of Donald Trump, a fierce opponent of the European Union, but Biden has said in a New York Times interview that his priorities will be to improve investment in US manufacturing and the protection of American workers.

“I’m not going to enter any new trade agreement with anybody until we have made major investments here at home and in our workers and in education,” he said.

Some supporters of Brexit had touted a US trade deal as one of the early benefits of leaving the EU and its customs union, although the economic value of such a deal had been questioned.

Biden told the New York Times: “I want to make sure we’re going to fight like hell by investing in America first.” He named energy, biotech, advanced materials and artificial intelligence as areas ripe for large-scale government investment in research.

The remarks underline the extent to which leading Democrats have retreated from a wholesale embrace of globalisation, and insist US foreign policy must give greater priority to America’s domestic interests.

The UK Foreign Office and the trade department still have a number of trade deals in the offing, and may look for a deal with Asia-Pacific nations as a way of filling the vacuum likely to be created by Biden’s priorities. The UK cannot formally engage with the new administration until his inauguration in January, but it has been making contacts with senior Democrat senators.

Biden also suggested the best route to gaining leverage over trade with China lay in building alliances to compete with it. Biden said his “goal would be to pursue trade policies that actually produce progress on China’s abusive practices – that’s stealing intellectual property, dumping products, illegal subsidies to corporations” and forcing “tech transfers” from US companies to their Chinese counterparts.

He said that leverage could be built by building a domestic consensus in favour of domestic investment, including in US semiconductors.

He said he would not be lifting any tariffs on China at this stage, but instead conducting a review. “The best China strategy, I think, is one which gets every one of our – or at least what used to be our – allies on the same page. It’s going to be a major priority for me in the opening weeks of my presidency to try to get us back on the same page with our allies.”

The EU has already sent a note to the Biden team seeking a common strategy on China.

Biden also for the first time since his election made clear that he was committed to trying to bring the US and Iran back into compliance with the existing nuclear deal signed in 2015 before trying to negotiate an update or expansion of the deal. Donald Trump took the US out of the deal in 2018, imposing heavy economic sanctions. Iran has responded by loosening its commitments under the deal on stockpiles of enriched uranium, but has allowed UN inspections of its nuclear sites to continue.

Some have argued that Biden should not lift the crippling US sanctions until Iran has committed to a wider deal that includes its missile programme, regional behaviour and updates some of the commitments in the existing deal.

Biden said: “Look, there’s a lot of talk about precision missiles and all range of other things that are destabilising the region.” He added that the best way to achieve stability in the region was to deal “with the nuclear programme”.

If Iran got a nuclear bomb, he added, it put enormous pressure on the Saudis, Turkey, Egypt and others to get nuclear weapons themselves. “And the last goddamn thing we need in that part of the world is a buildup of nuclear capability,” he said.

Then, Biden added: “In consultation with our allies and partners, we’re going to engage in negotiations and follow-on agreements to tighten and lengthen Iran’s nuclear constraints, as well as address the missile programme.” He added he would like more than the existing signatories to the present deal – France, Germany, the UK, Russia and China – to be signatories to any new deal, but for other regional players Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to be onboard.

He said that the US, once back in the deal, could call for the snapback of UN sanctions if it deemed Iran was still not in compliance its terms, something he said Iran knew.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

But now we have a piece of truly perplexing news that we’re going to need someone to sort out for us. Today, in separate press conferences, the biggest publishers in the world just revealed that the upcoming installments in the Super Mario, Grand Theft Auto, and Metal Gear Solid franchises are somehow all subtitled “ The Sands of Time” ?

Your guess is as good as ours, gamers. We got nothing on this one.

While we’re incredibly excited to have Nintendo, Rockstar Games, and Hideo Kojima all taking the stage on the same day, we’re also having a tremendous amount of trouble wrapping our heads around why each of the developers’ latest games seems to be named after the 2003 action-platformer set in ancient Persia—or are they? We really have no idea.

Advertisement

It’s especially confusing given that most of the titles in some way makes use of an hourglass in the graphic. You could argue that it was just a mistake if it only happened to be one of these companies that adopted the “Sands of Time” suffix. But all three? It just doesn’t make any sense.

Super Mario: Sands of Time. Grand Theft Auto: The Sands of Time. Metal Gear Solid: The Sands of Time. We’re not going to act like these aren’t cool titles. They definitely are. But we’d assume that Ubisoft would have the exclusive rights to that phrase. Even if not, why would any other game developer want to associate their games with such an iconic phrase? It’s simply not possible that nobody at any of these three major video game companies had ever heard of the original “Sands of Time” game. That was one of the most popular titles of the sixth console generation.

Advertisement

Does anyone understand how this could have happened? Anyone?

We’re just going to go ahead and assume that each game has some sort of time-travel element too, but why would these publishers do that? How could all three of them possibly use this mechanic in an inventive way?

Advertisement

Please don’t take our confusion as negativity, gamers. These are huge announcements for some of the most popular franchises in video game history. We’re talking about a new Metal Gear Solid, a series long thought dead since Kojima’s departure from Konami. And new titles in Mario and Grand Theft Auto? This is incredibly exciting stuff. All we’re saying is that it’s kind of incomprehensible why any single one of them would choose to have a title that had already been used 17 years ago.

We reached out to programmers at Nintendo, Rockstar, and Konami about it, but they refused to respond and seemed genuinely angry that we questioned this baffling decision.

Advertisement

Are they fucking with us?

Seriously, gamers, if anyone knows what the hell is going on here please let us know. Maybe there’s some sort of movement to establish “Sands of Time” as its own video game genre subset that we don’t know about? Or for some reason, all future video ga mes will be named after Prince Of Persia games or Jake Gyllenhaal films? Whatever the truth is, we’re confused but prepared to enjoy these awesome new games alongside the just announced Prince of Persia: The Origami King.",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Today we visit Keukenhof, the heart of the glorious Dutch bulbfields. On arrival, nothing prepares you for the dazzling spectrum of colours stretched out before you in the world’s largest flower garden, covering nearly 80 acres. The art of flower planting reaches breathtaking heights at Keukenhof, a gardener’s heaven created by more than seven million tulips, daffodils and other blooms set among a beautiful landscape of shimmering lakes, ancient trees, flowering shrubs and water gardens. We re-join our ship in Amsterdam and after lunch you’re free to explore as you wish. Amsterdam is an art-lover’s dream. The Rijksmuseum is an architectural marvel itself, but it holds a magnificent collection of works by Dutch masters such as Rembrandt and Vermeer, while admirers of Post-Impressionism might prefer the Van Gogh Museum, housing the world’s greatest collection of works by this genius of a man. Or relax in a pavement café, absorbing Amsterdam’s special atmosphere over a rich Dutch coffee, browse the many shops or perhaps just stay on board to catch up on some reading. Tonight there’s another culinary highlight – the Captain’s Dinner, when the chef prepares his superb ‘signature’ dishes for you to enjoy in the splendid surroundings of the ship’s restaurant, with a chance to reflect on the fascinating places you have discovered, poignant stories you have heard and the new friends you have made.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
601,601,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada’s Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. “To come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,” he said.

Watt’s photographs of the forest – and the grim aftermath of logging – are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the “graveyard of stumps” in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

“We’re in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we’re allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,” he said. “A lot of people are shocked that that’s still happening here. It’s not illegal. The government sanctions it.”

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province’s southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island’s original old growth forests – where Watt shot his before-and-after series – are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) – or about 1% of the deferred areas – is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

“There’s a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,” said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. “That means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.”

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

“I’m going to keep taking these ‘before’ photos,” said Watt. “And it’s up to politicians if there’s going to be an ‘after’ shot.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
598,598,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it’s been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK’s first female prime minister?

It’s a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council’s controversial decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: “We find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.”

He added: “She was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country’s has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.”

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

“It’s been a long hard road. There’s been a few knocks and bumps along the way,” Schonhut said. “It’s nice to see things finally coming to fruition.”

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini Brexit,” she said. She hopes it’ll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . “In the area we’re living in we’re seeing a huge number of homeless people, we’re seeing food banks springing up all over the place.”

Burgess added that given Thatcher’s controversial legacy it was a “poorly judged decision” to push ahead with the statue. “There’s got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.”

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. “It’s a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

“I appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it’s a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.”

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. “The first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.”

He added: “I think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
584,584,"Six in a row: winning numbers in South African lottery are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10",[],"An unusual sequence of numbers drawn by South Africa’s national lottery has left players dumbfounded and sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a “PowerBall” number of 10 were the South African national lottery’s winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

“Congratulations to tonight’s 20 winners of PowerBall draw,” the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. “These numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.”

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

“Lotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,” posted one Twitter user. “20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,” ventured another. “Absolutely no way in hell that’s a coincidence.”

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma’s nine-year tenure.

South Africa’s National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review “and if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that”.

“So we are in the process of doing that currently.”

While it is not uncommon for two players to share the jackpot, multiple winners are extremely rare. The numbers are drawn live on TV.

In March 2003, 33 players won a share of the jackpot, according to a South African website that tallies results.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1016,1016,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she’d taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. “And then the next morning, I just went: ‘No, that’s it, I’m going out.’” She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. “It’s at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,” she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself – making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

“I started to get those feelings last week,” she says. “There’s a terrible uneasiness. There’s this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can’t concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there’s a feeling of complete hopelessness.” There are physical sensations, too – her heart races, and she feels hot. “And just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.” Although it’s tough to experience, it is, she says, “a godsend that I know what’s happening now”.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, “the usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out”. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, “we’re not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious”.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we’re not around the people who might spot something is off – our family, friends or colleagues – and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

“For instance, if you are feeling very sad,” says Robinson, “you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you’re not looking forward to anything in the future. That’s quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.” Instead, says Robinson, “ask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to”.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. “Normally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,” she says. “But everyone’s finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can’t concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?”

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we’re living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? “So ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?” Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. “So the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself – and in a limited, more muted way than previously – am I still able to motivate myself to see people?”

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. “Again, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that’s a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,” says Robinson. “But if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can’t get things done that need to get done, you can’t get the shopping in, you can’t bring yourself to eat or you’re overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can’t function, these would be warning signs to seek help.”

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you’re being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and “whether people find that they’re excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn’t mean you’ve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That’s a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.”

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. “We’re all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there’s a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.”

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about “thriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there’s that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There’s more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there’s an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.”

The core symptoms of depression, he says, “are a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn’t necessarily indicate that there’s definitely a mental health condition.” It’s when it becomes pervasive and has an “impact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we’re becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.” However, he points out, “everybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what’s normal for you?”

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, “I found that suddenly I wasn’t reading and I thought: ‘This is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?’ I’d start and I couldn’t concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn’t even pick up a book.” A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. “I haven’t played the guitar since lockdown. It’s something that I really enjoy, but I can’t kind of get around to doing it.” During low periods, “I tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I’ll find excuses why I can’t see them. So I know that I’ve got to force myself to do something.” Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people “and just be silly”, but obviously it hasn’t been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it’s not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise – particularly walking – works for her, “and cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‘You’ve failed again, you’re going back to where you were.’ It’s just like: ‘No, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.’ And it’s on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.” She would seek help, she says, “if it got to the point that I wouldn’t be able to manage it myself”.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. “The charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,” she says. “You should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.” There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. “I would emphasise that it’s been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,” says Obuaya. “Therefore we shouldn’t make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they’ve got a major mental health problem.” But, he stresses, there is “a range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.”

262,262,America’s Pride In The Economy Is About To Be Greatly Shaken As Tens Of Millions Face Eviction In 2021,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Unless there is emergency intervention, tens of millions of Americans could be facing eviction once the holiday season is over.

We kicked the can down the road throughout 2020, but all of the rent that was originally owed to landlords all over the country is still due, and they are very eager to collect.

Countless landlords are on the verge of financial ruin because of the rent moratoriums which were put in place, and kicking the can down the road even more would be absolutely disastrous for them.

Of course it would also be absolutely disastrous if the moratoriums are not extended, because in some states more than half of all households are behind on their rent or mortgage payments, and most of them have no way to pay.

Can you imagine who counter to reality our lives would be if someone who can’t even identify her own gender is responsible for the terms we define medicine by?

One way or the other, we are about to hit a breaking point. The Aspen Institute is telling us that a whopping 40 million people “could face eviction over the next several months”…

According to research by the Aspen Institute, nearly 40 million Americans could face eviction over the next several months. The only thing holding back the flood right now is the CDC’s eviction moratorium order and a patchwork of state and local protections for renters. But these moratoriums are only kicking the can down the road. Chief economist for Moody’s Analytics Mark Zandi told the Washington Post that tenants could owe nearly $70 billion in back rent by year’s end. And for landlords left holding the bag, there’s been little relief, as they’ve been forced to take on the role of government — subsidizing housing for millions even as their own taxes, mortgage payments, and other expenses are due.

That is about 12 percent of the entire country.

If they get evicted, where are they going to go?

Into the streets?

Vox recently interviewed a 48-year-old Texas resident named “Kimberly”, and she says that is exactly where she is headed if she gets evicted…

But after Covid-19 hit, she lost hours at her job as a crew trainer at Raising Cane’s Chicken Fingers and found herself on the brink of financial collapse. She fell behind on her rent and when she tried to work with her landlord to set up a repayment plan, she told Vox that she was served an eviction notice. Now, the only thing keeping her in her home is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) national eviction moratorium, which prohibits landlords from evicting qualifying tenants for failing to make rent. If she’s evicted, Kimberly says she has nowhere to go — and will be homeless for the second time in five years.

And there are countless others out there that are just like her.

According to Zero Hedge, “at least half of households in Arkansas, Florida and Nevada are not current on rent and mortgage payments”.

We have never seen anything like this in modern American history, and the new lockdowns that are being instituted across the nation will just make things even worse.

Of course there are many Americans that will be able to move in with family, and this has already been happening in very large numbers. In particular, young people are moving back in with their parents on a massive scale. According to the Pew Research Center, “a majority of young adults in the U.S. live with their parents for the first time since the Great Depression”.

The phrase “since the Great Depression” has been popping up a lot lately, hasn’t it?

That is because this is literally the first economic depression that the U.S. has experienced since that time.

Everywhere we look, we can see the sort of economic devastation that I have been warning was coming for a very long time.

In New Jersey, approximately one-third of all small businesses “have closed down in 2020”…

A third of small businesses in New Jersey have closed down in 2020, according to a report from The Star-Ledger newspaper. “It’s really bad… And without federal dollars coming into New Jersey, the Main Street stores and other establishments are not gonna make it through the winter.” said Eileen Kean, the state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.

New Jersey’s number is higher than the national average, but not by very much.

Of course Atlantic City has been hit particularly hard because it is so dependent on tourism. At this point, it is being called “the city without a pulse”…

The boardwalk is empty, the beaches are deserted, and the casinos, though partially reopen, are limping into their fifth month of severely curtailed operations after four months of shutdowns. The coronavirus pandemic skewered the economic engine of this beachside town, taking the city’s vibrancy and its residents’ livelihoods out with it.

Sadly, things are inevitably going to get worse in the months ahead thanks to the new lockdowns. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment has risen significantly for the past two weeks, and more bad weeks are almost certainly ahead.

Needless to say, rising unemployment will mean more Americans being pushed out of their homes and more Americans being pushed into poverty. According to a survey that was released in October, the number of Americans living in poverty has risen by 8 million since May…

The number of Americans living in poverty grew by 8 million since May, according to a Columbia University study, which found an increase in poverty rates after early coronavirus relief ended without more to follow. Although the federal Cares Act, which gave Americans a one-time stimulus check of $1,200 and unemployed workers an extra $600 each week, was successful at offsetting growing poverty rates in the spring, the effects were short-lived, researchers found in the study published Thursday.

Of course that number is more than a month old, and so the true number of Americans that have been forced into poverty is substantially higher by now.

This is what an economic collapse looks like, and even worse days are ahead of us.

The good news is that those that were warned in advance that an economic collapse was coming had time to make preparations for this sort of a scenario.

But most Americans never wanted to listen to the warnings, and so now they find themselves in the middle of a storm without an umbrella.

Unfortunately, what we have experienced so far is just the leading edge of the storm, and most people still do not realize that.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

392,392,Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 13 and a half months over protest,[],"The high-profile Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong will spend more than a year in jail over an unauthorised protest outside police headquarters in June last year, a court in the city has ruled.

Fellow activists Agnes Chow, 23, and Ivan Lam, 26, were sentenced to 10 months and seven months respectively.

Wong said last week he expected to be jailed after admitting organising the event early on in Hong Kong’s recent protest movement, which began with millions marching against an extradition bill before growing into a broader pro-democracy push.

At the West Kowloon magistrates court on Wednesday, the 24-year-old was sentenced to a total of 13 and a half months in jail for organising and inciting others to attend an unlawful assembly outside the police headquarters in June 2019.

The judge, Wong Sze-lai, took the prior records of Lam and Wong into account and said jail time was the only appropriate option in order to deter others.

“The court has considered that the offending period of the three defendants lasted for around 15 minutes and all the facts of the case, including that they committed the offence in a joint enterprise under the prevailing circumstances of increasing incidents of social unrest and large scale public protests, which in the court’s view, made the case more serious,” the judge said.

Hong Kong’s mini-constitution protects the right to free assembly. Wong and others were high-profile members of the protest movement, but it was considered to be largely leaderless.

The three were jailed immediately, and an application from Chow for bail pending an appeal was reportedly rejected.

Wong had pleaded guilty to organising and incitement, Lam to incitement, and Chow to incitement and attending. Wong and Lam had initially intended to fight the charges, until announcing on the eve of the trial that they would plead guilty to some. Chow, who is also facing potential charges under the national security law after being arrested in August, had already determined to plead guilty in the hope of a less sentence.

Before leaving court last week, Wong shouted: “Everyone hang in there, add oil,” using a phrase of encouragement meaning “let’s go” commonly heard at protests. As he was led away on Wednesday, he shouted: “I will hang in there.”

The three were denied bail after entering their pleas and taken into remand. Wong was held in solitary confinement after an X-ray reportedly showed a “shadow” in his stomach, according to a post on the activist’s social media page. Both Wong and Lam have been previously incarcerated, but it was the first time on remand for Chow, who turns 24 on Thursday. She recently said she was struggling mentally while being held, and was visibly distressed during Wednesday’s sentencing.

More than 10,000 protesters have been arrested over Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests, many on questionable charges of rioting and unauthorised assembly that have not held up in court.

Chow and Wong gained notoriety during the 79-day “umbrella movement” protests in 2014 that demanded universal suffrage for Hongkongers. As a result of those protests, Wong, Chow, and their fellow activist now living in the UK, Nathan Law, co-founded the pro-democracy Demosisto political party. Its four candidates elected to the legislative council were disqualified for modifying the oath of office when they tried to take their seats. The party was formally disbanded after the introduction of the national security law in June.

Law said the sentencing constituted “another blatant attack on the Hong Kong activists, whose wishes are solely bringing democracy to Hong Kong”.

The UK foreign minister, Dominic Raab, said prosecutions must be fair and impartial, and the rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers upheld. “I urge the Hong Kong and Beijing authorities to bring an end to their campaign to stifle opposition,” he said.

Wong and Chow are two of the most high-profile figures of the pro-democracy movement. After Wong’s arrest in September, the British foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said he was “deeply concerned” and described it as “another example of HK authorities targeting activists”.

Wong has maintained a defiant approach during the court case, saying last week: “I am persuaded that neither prison bars, nor election ban, nor any other arbitrary powers would stop us from activism.”

He also urged people to focus on the plight of the “Hong Kong 12”, the detained group accused of attempting to travel illegally to Taiwan by boat in August. They have been held in a mainland detention centre ever since, with their families accusing authorities of denying the group access to lawyers, visitors, or medical treatment.

Chow, who gave up her British citizenship to run in Hong Kong elections, was one of the first Demosisto politicians barred from standing for office because the party advocated “self-determination”.

One of her most successful roles has been bringing international attention to Hong Kong’s democracy movement, aided by her fluency in English, Cantonese and Japanese. She built a huge social media following in Japan in particular. Chow was arrested in August under the national security law, on the vague suspicion of “colluding with foreign forces”.

At least 31 people have been arrested under the national security law imposed by Beijing in late June, which outlaws a broad range of acts as sedition, secession, foreign collusion, and terrorism.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1019,1019,My wife wants a lover. How can I help her find one?,[],"We are a retired couple who have been married for 40 years. I adore my wife and she adores me. We still have an active sex life, but we have talked about her finding another sexual partner to be with on occasion. Neither of us approves of going online to find one. How would you suggest that we find her a “friend with benefits”, whom she can be with and trust? Our kids all live away from us, so we are not terribly hung up about anyone finding out.

The key issue is “trust”. It is never easy to find someone to trust with any aspect of your life – finances, work, household, even grooming – so, naturally, it will be particularly difficult when it comes to creating a sexual triad.

The first thing for you and your wife to do is to discuss in great detail exactly what that “agreement” would look like. For example, would it be OK for the third person to be someone in your community, whom you might see in other settings? Would you risk bringing that person into your home, or would it be better to use a different location? Would your wife see the person alone, or would you be present? What boundaries should be set? What are the safety considerations? Human beings are hardwired to feel jealousy; although you may think this would not arise, it probably would – how would you address that? Would details be shared?

There needs to be clear, transparent, mutual consent – including by the third person. It may be best to seek an established “swingers” community near you, since, within it, you are more likely to find someone who is already comfortable with unorthodox relationships. But you will still have to follow rules, exercise caution and be prepared for unexpected feelings and events.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
324,324,Trump Says Big Tech Immunities Must Be Terminated for ‘National Security’ Reasons,[],"President Trump posted to Twitter late Thursday evening his call for the “immediate” termination of Section 230 of the Communications and Decency Act, declaring that the liability protections of Big Tech companies like Facebook and Twitter should be stripped for “purposes of national security.”

For purposes of National Security, Section 230 must be immediately terminated!!! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

Currently, Big Tech companies claim they act as a neutral platform, meaning that they receive certain protections from what people post on their site under Section 230, which gives them a “liability shield.” However, given that they have engaged in the censorship of conservatives, they act more like a publisher, who is more liable for what is on their site.

The announcement followed a tweet from President Trump that attacked Twitter for “sending out totally false ‘Trends’ that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world.” He argued that the trends are simply made up, and they are only “negative” ones. “Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to Fox News daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination!” the President concluded.

Twitter is sending out totally false “Trends” that have absolutely nothing to do with what is really trending in the world. They make it up, and only negative “stuff”. Same thing will happen to Twitter as is happening to @FoxNews daytime. Also, big Conservative discrimination! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2020

This is not the first time that the President has called for the end of Section 230. Last month, after Facebook and Twitter removed a story from the New York post about emails between Joe Biden and his son Hunter, he also called for the repeal of Section 230. However, this is the first time that the call has been made to do it “immediately,” and also the first time “national security” has been posited as a reason for doing so.

So terrible that Facebook and Twitter took down the story of “Smoking Gun” emails related to Sleepy Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, in the @NYPost. It is only the beginning for them. There is nothing worse than a corrupt politician. REPEAL SECTION 230!!! https://t.co/g1RJFpIVUZ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 14, 2020

The President’s actions may have had something to do with the behaviour of Big Tech over the course of this election. Throughout the election, a large quantity of the President’s tweets and other social media postings, along with those of many of his supporters, have been labelled as misinformation, with Tucker Carlson even arguing that Big Tech rigged the election in favour of Joe Biden “in plain sight.”

Only this week, the personal Twitter account of Pennsylvania state Senator Doug Mastriano was banned, after the Senator had organised a hearing in his state’s legislature about the vast irregularities that took place in this month’s presidential election.

In May this year, the President signed an executive order that would strip the liability shield away from Big Tech companies if they engaged in “censoring or any political conduct.” As National File reported:

The executive order also instructs Attorney General William Barr to work with the states to develop their own legislation regarding censorship online, and also instructs his adminstration to start developing policies to “ensure taxpayer dollars are not going to any social media that suppresses free speech. The President noted that Big Tech companies have had “unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter, virtually any communication between private citizens and large public audiences.”",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
774,774,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It’s the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It’s now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it’s honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It’s a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum’s executive director.

“Even though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,” said Horsford. “It can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.”

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. “They think, oh we’re in the north, that wasn’t an issue here,” she says. “From my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it’s a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.”

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. “People who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don’t say much more,” she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it’s a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

“We wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we’re talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,” adds Horsford. “We never want to say: ‘these people were just slaves,’ because there’s so much to the story than just that.”

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm’s former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

“I wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today’s generations, are human,” said Black. “That’s something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.”

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

“We must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,” said Black. “Not just select people.”

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the “front parlor”, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information “relating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room”, said Sydlowski. “These images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.”

Sydlowski’s work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, “created specifically for those who were enslaved”, she said. “The parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.”

It captures an ongoing battle. “New York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,” said Sydlowski. “My installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.”

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

“Highlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,” said Prevost.

“Today, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,” she adds.

“Following our recent election, we’ve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1003,1003,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world’s coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world’s biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries – Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal – will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction – known as exclusive economic zones – are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: “Humanity’s wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.”

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: “Australians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods … When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.”

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world’s oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was “a really big deal” and could restore the health of the world’s oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

“What you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it’s not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant – business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,” she said. “The oceans are in a very sorry state right now.”

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. “We are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.”

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: “If we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.”

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of “ghost” fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a “circular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of “dead zones” from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik Österblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: “[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.”

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world’s oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: “The UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
979,979,Fans are back! But avoid using toilets during peak times,[],"THE RETURN OF PROPER FOOTBALL

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage “football without fans is nothing” is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we’d either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we’d have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven’t done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn’t it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid “unnecessary movement”. They’ve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there’s no tomorrow, without having to purchase a “substantial meal”, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal’s poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we’ll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language. The Fiver is very much looking forward to it.

For many waking in Vienna on New Year's Day will be a highlight of the cruise. The city’s very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city was the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world’s finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and of course, a whole family of Strausses. In this capitvating city, there’s also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School and the Vienna Boys’ Choir. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire. There has also been a Yuletide market in Vienna since the Middle Ages and today the markets held over the festive period sell a huge range of seasonal gifts and mouth-watering treats. This morning we enjoy a tour in the company of a local guide who will offer insights into why Vienna is one of Europe’s great capitals, now proudly embellished in winter sparkle. There will also be time to browse the stalls of the markets where the irresistible smell of roasting chestnuts fills the air. Alternatively retreat to the refined yet cosy elegance of a traditional Viennese café for a steaming hot chocolate and a tempting pastry. After lunch on board we visit the magnificent Schönbrunn Palace. Once the summer residence of the Hapsburgs, this former royal residence now houses a range of world-class museums and galleries.

945,945,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November’s presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her “overwhelming” experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

“Not a day goes by where there’s not a crowd outside,” Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump’s election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” was Giuliani’s response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani’s 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business’s branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

“This is a construction yard, that’s a liability,” Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

“It did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‘Who knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?’”

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians’ incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

I woke up early, still laughing at Rudy Giuliani spewing bullshit from an industrial lot between a crematorium and dildo shop, having booked a press conference into the Four Seasons...wait for it...Total Landscaping.

In nine months a lot of baby girls are going to be named “Georgia” and “Four Seasons Total Landscaping.” — Bess Kalb (@bessbell) November 8, 2020

Trump himself lent weight to the idea of mistaken identity when he tweeted, then deleted, that the press conference was at “Four Seasons, Philadelphia”.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

“That’s not the case,” said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

“I gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.”

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

“The response is overwhelming, that there’s still so, so many good people in the world, and they got to laugh with this,” Siravo said.

“And it was nothing we anticipated.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

413,413,The Crown has slipped: how the Netflix epic captures our relationship with the royals,[],"‘Let’s get it over with,” sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?

A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan’s Netflix epic. Firstly, it’s just as well The Crown isn’t on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation’s enraged rightwing culture warriors would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman’s Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia – not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.

The rest of her family are a hindrance more than a help. After her, there’s nothing. Well, there’s Prince Charles but Josh O’Connor’s portrayal locates the heir to the throne halfway between Alan Partridge and The Simpsons’ Montgomery Burns; petty, emotionally stunted and inadequate. The Crown isn’t so much a drama about the monarchy as a drama about how the monarchy might die. Furthermore, the suggestion is that this would be a merciful release. Frequently, relations between the Queen’s children play out as a toxic game of performative unhappiness. Of course, as she did in most areas, Princess Diana’s arrival and swift descent into misery trumps them all, leaving everyone, Diana most of all, even unhappier than they had been before.

Much of the criticism of this series of The Crown has stemmed from the perceived inaccuracies of the “history” on offer. It’s a peculiar complaint, not least because this has always been an issue, so it seems strange to raise it so late in the day. After all, as far back as season one, the series was dabbling in alternative facts – for example, there’s no convincing evidence that the Queen took Winston Churchill to task for his handling of the London smog crisis. This was a device intended to show Elizabeth II’s sense of devotion to her subjects. It seems there was no problem with altering history when it painted “The Firm” in a good light.

In truth, TV treatments of the institution of monarchy have been subtly shifting for a while. And why shouldn’t they move with the currents of the times? After all, what is the institution of royalty if not a constructed narrative; a story we allow ourselves to be told? Arguments about accuracy are, at root, arguments about the whole concept of storytelling – which is the speciality of supporters of the monarchy and the Windsors themselves. What was the Charles and Diana match if not exactly that? A stage-managed “fairytale” wedding between two palpably ill-suited individuals working towards the continuity of a longer story. If series four of The Crown emphasises the misery of that marriage, it’s simply reminding us that even in so-called real-life, there’s no such thing as a consistently reliable authorial voice. If myths can be built, they can be dismantled, too, when the dramatic need arises.

In terms of its content, The Crown is unusual, in that it represents a break from certain traditions governing small-screen royal mythmaking. Most serious TV dramas portraying the family have either imagined possible futures – such as King Charles III (BBC Two) which posited a constitutional crisis triggered by Elizabeth II’s successor refusing to sign a bill into law – or mined Britain’s deep past. Until recently, there seemed to be an unspoken rule forbidding the exploitation of royal secrets for scurrilous entertainment until a century or so had passed. Shows such as ITV’s Victoria and BBC/Showtime’s The Tudors were essentially origin stories.

However, The Crown engages with the events of our lifetimes and this gives it much of its potency, not to mention its potential to cause controversy. In fact, you can sense the parameters of royal narrative building shifting even as you’re watching. In the latest series, there’s a tragicomic moment when Prince Andrew – then at the height of his public popularity as the helicopter hero Action Royal – talks to the Queen about his private life. “I was shocked,” she later reflects to her husband. “If he doesn’t change …” The sentence is left hanging, a gaping hole that the viewer is invited to fill with thoughts of Jeffrey Epstein and Pizza Express in Woking. We know too much now to believe in fairytales, so The Crown is constantly having to make allowances for our changing perceptions.

Princess Diana was, of course, where the function – and the aesthetics – of royalty began to change. She coped by establishing herself as a celebrity in the most modern sense of the word. And accordingly, she became a walking paradox: her charisma kept the royals relevant while signposting their doom. In the wake of Diana, deference has begun to dwindle. The 2011 TV movie William & Kate seemingly escaped from the pages of the most low-rent gossip mag in the supermarket, covering the titular couple’s courtship in hilariously and unapologetically trashy style. And Channel 4’s comedy The Windsors delights in treating the family as essentially one step up from the most gormless reality TV personalities. Tellingly, the Queen never appears. Her presence would be a category error; correctly, the show’s writers have recognised that she doesn’t belong in that world – a hangover from the age of deference.

So where does the story go next? In the context of The Crown itself, it’s obvious. But in terms of our relationship with this family and the way our national narrative intersects with theirs, it’s anyone’s guess. But while Prince Harry is essentially a character actor in the Windsor story, his fate might represent the shape of things to come. In King Charles III, there’s a subplot in which Harry falls in love with a working-class republican. The affair is fleeting but oddly prophetic – the Prince shaking the bars of his gilded cage.

In some ways, The Crown represents the culmination and acceleration of a process that has been going on for some time. The show began in the post second-world-war period – the fortunes of the young Elizabeth dovetailing with rose-tinted memories of that idealised period of British life. The country was bruised but unbowed; putting itself back together after a painful victory. As the empire dissolved and global British influence declined, the period was the beginning of an ending. But superficially, it looked like a fresh start. Accordingly, in the early seasons of The Crown, the Windsors strike an uneasy balance between duty and happiness. In many ways, their self-sacrifice seems noble.

But increasingly, the narrative emphasis and the emotional tone of TV portrayals has shifted. Whether comic or dramatic, there’s a distinct scepticism emerging; a republican fist in a respectful velvet glove. Harry and Meghan’s withdrawal from the whole, ever-renewing box set of a story feels more and more like a logical response to the unhappiness and impotence dramatised in The Crown and the frivolity mocked in The Windsors. As long as Elizabeth II reigns over us, the line will hold. But the next generations – of royals and commoners alike – might well wonder whether it’s all worth it.

446,446,"Strictly dropped us after we asked to be paid, say musicians",[],"A group of professional musicians have said they were dropped by Strictly Come Dancing after they asked to be paid for performing on the programme’s spinoff show.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day’s work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: “We just don’t have money in the budget to pay for contributors.” Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a “decent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name”, which would help boost the band’s following on Instagram and Facebook.

“Hopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,” they were told by the show’s producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians’ Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: “The days of ‘it’ll give you exposure’ (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won’t get any gigs these days and we won’t sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production … They want us and our expertise, but they won’t pay for it.”

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: “Like all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven’t raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven’t monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

“We do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than £20,000 a year, is a pittance.”

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly’s hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: “Externally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.”

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: “As we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn’t happen for editorial reasons.”

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: “Had they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

134,134,BBC Studios Imposes 20 Percent Diversity Quota on All New Productions,['David Ng'],"BBC Studios, the largest producer of content in Great Britain, is imposing a 20 percent diversity quota on all new productions in an apparent effort to boost the visibility of ethnic minorities, LGBTQ individuals, and people with disabilities.

The studio announced the quotas on Monday, saying in a press release that the new “inclusion rider” is effective immediately and will apply to on-screen talent and well as behind-the-scenes staff on all new BBC and third-party U.K. commissions. The rider targets so-called “BAME” individuals — black, Asian, minority ethnic people, as well as the disabled and low-income individuals.

“These initiatives are by no means a magic bullet and we’re also doing a lot of work on culture and education to make our teams more inclusive,” Ralph Lee, BBC Studios’ director of content, said in a statement. “The talent in front of and behind the camera will give perspectives that will shape our content, making it more authentic and universal in its depiction of our audiences — and ultimately its appeal with them.”

BBC Studios said that LGBTQ talent won’t be eligible for off-screen quotas because the company “has already exceeded this target.”

Among the most popular shows from BBC Studios are Top Gear, Doctor Who, Good Omens, Luther, and the long-running EastEnders. The studio, which is the production arm of the BBC, also creates content for distributors around the world, including Amazon, Apple, and China Mobile.

The initiative is the latest move by the entertainment industry to impose diversity quotas on movies and TV shows. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced in September that movies must reach certain quotas for women, ethnic minorities, disabled, and LGBTQ people if they are to be considered for the best picture Oscars category.

1009,1009,"Faith review – compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains “warrior monks” in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks’ daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white – it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn’t help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there’s no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions – five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken – to fuel his narcissism and ego, I’d say. It’s deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I’d like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

We need someone who’s trained for this sort of thing.’ I first worked with Phil back on Game Of Thrones, when my character was supposed to be angry and in love at the same time, and it was way too hard to do both. You should see some of the feelings this guy can express—it’s wild.” At press time, sources said production for Aquaman 2 had been delayed so Westwood could wrap up some acting work as John Cena’s scene double in Fast And Furious 9.

408,408,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan’s Princess Mako – the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne – and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom’s mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan’s royals; it has also brought the country’s succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro’s mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako’s father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

“I approve of them getting married,” he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. “The constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.”

But, he added, Komuro’s family needed to make a “visible” response to his mother’s financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: “From my point of view, I don’t think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]” – adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor’s daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively “ordinary” life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan’s succession laws, no female member of the imperial family – not even the emperor’s 19-year-old daughter, Aiko – can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako’s younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other “irreplaceable”, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as “someone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
405,405,"Covid vaccinations will begin next week, says Boris Johnson",[],"Mass immunisation against coronavirus will begin next week, Boris Johnson announced as he moved to defuse a diplomatic row over claims that Brexit was responsible for the fast-track approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

The prime minister said hopes of normal life returning in the spring had given way to “sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed” after Britain became the first country in the western world to approve a Covid vaccine.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said no corners had been cut in licensing the jab in record time, and the vaccine had been subjected to the most thorough scrutiny by experts working round the clock. The UK has bought 40m doses of the vaccine, which has been shown to have 95% efficacy.

Jonathan Van-Tam, a deputy chief medical officer for England, said the announcement of the news on Wednesday morning had made him feel “quite emotional”.

He said once all of the vulnerable groups highlighted as a priority by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had been protected – including elderly people and those with underlying medical conditions – it should help to prevent 99% of deaths from the virus, which has claimed up to 75,000 lives in the UK.

But the prime minister also moved to prevent what he called the “huge moment” being tarnished by a row after Matt Hancock suggested Brexit had paved the way for the move.

The health secretary claimed that “because of Brexit”, the UK had been able to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, rather than wait for the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to do so. The EMA said on Tuesday that it may wait until the end of December under a less fast-tracked authorisation process.

“Because of Brexit, we’ve been able to make a decision to do this based on the UK regulator, a world-class regulator, and not go at the pace of the Europeans, who are moving a little bit more slowly,” Hancock told Times Radio.

That sparked a backlash from the EU, however. Germany’s health minister, Jens Spahn, said Berlin had also considered the fast-track licensing chosen by the UK – and allowed by any country in emergency circumstances under EU law – but the task of convincing people of the safety of vaccines was crucial.

“The idea is not that we’re the first, but the idea is to have safe and effective vaccines in the pandemic and that we can create confidence, and nothing is more important than confidence with respect to vaccines,” he said.

Later, with negotiations on a free trade agreement at a delicate stage weeks from the end of the transition period, Johnson eschewed the language of “world-beating” UK science and twice declined the opportunity to hail the rapid approval as a Brexit dividend.

“I’m going to exercise a self-denying ordinance, my fabled diplomacy and tact, and just say I think that this is something that the NHS has been working on for a long time; the vaccine taskforce; many people have been working on this for a long time and I pay tribute to all of them,” he told a Downing Street press conference.

The UK remains under the remit of the EMA until the end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January, and EU laws allow other member states to approve medicines for emergency use without EMA authorisation.

Johnson said it was important to avoid “overoptimism” and the public should stick to the tough restrictions in place after England’s lockdown ended on Wednesday, including strict limits on indoor socialising, because it would take months for the vaccine to be rolled out.

“It will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long and cold months. So it is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with overoptimism, or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over,” he said.

And Van-Tam sounded a note of caution about whether normal life would resume in full. “I don’t think we’re going to eradicate coronavirus, ever; I think it’s going to be with humankind forever,” he said.

“Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party, and throw away our masks and hand sanitiser, and say: ‘That’s it, it’s behind us!’ like the end of the war?

“No I don’t. I think those kind of habits, that we’ve learned from, that clearly help prevent the spread of other respiratory viruses, like the flu, will perhaps persist for many years, and it may be a good thing if they do.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing … on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

Hancock said a network of 50 hospitals was ready to deliver the first jabs, and specialist vaccination centres were being built. He said the vaccine would also be available from some GPs and pharmacists if they had cold storage facilities.

The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, warmly welcomed the approval of the vaccine but called on Johnson to do more to tackle the risk of misinformation, which he called “a real cause for concern”.

“It’s really important that we do everything possible to counter dangerous, frankly life-threatening disinformation about vaccines,” he said, urging the PM to pass emergency legislation to combat anti-vaxxer conspiracy theories online.

Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said “everyone can be absolutely confident that no corners have been cut” in the approval process. She contradicted Hancock, adding: “We’ve been able to authorise supply of this vaccine under provisions under European law which exist until 1 January.”

Albert Bourla, chair and chief executive officer of Pfizer, added: “Today’s emergency use authorisation in the UK marks a historic moment in the fight against Covid-19.

“This authorisation is a goal we have been working toward since we first declared that science will win, and we applaud the MHRA for their ability to conduct a careful assessment and take timely action to help protect the people of the UK.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
881,881,How to make cullen skink – recipe,[],"British soups revel in some very peculiar names, from cock-a-leekie to london particular, but perhaps none is more evocative than cullen skink, named after the fishing town on the Moray Firth and an old Scots word for a thin broth. Not that there’s anything thin about this version: packed with smoky haddock and soft, buttery vegetables, it’s the perfect winter warmer.

Prep 15 min

Cook 30 min

Serves 4-6

500g smoked haddock, skin on

1 bay leaf

1 onion

1 leek

1 knob butter

2 medium floury potatoes

500ml whole milk

Salt and white pepper

Chives, chopped, to serve (optional)

1 Start with the fish

Put the fish into a pan large enough to hold it comfortably (cut it in half if it’s too long, but leave the skin on as that brings flavour with it). Cover with about 300ml cold water, add the bay leaf and then bring slowly to the boil over a medium-low heat.

2 Cook the fish

By the time the water boils, the fish should be just cooked – to test this, see if it breaks into flakes at its thickest part. If it’s not quite there yet, turn off the heat and leave it in the hot water for another minute or so. Otherwise, remove the fish from the pan and leave to cool – take the pan off the heat and reserve the cooking liquid.

3 Now for the alliums …

While the fish is cooking, peel and finely chop the onion. Trim and wash the leek, making sure you get any grit from between the layers, then cut it into chunks. Melt the butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat, then add the onion and leek, cover and sweat gently for about 10 minutes.

4 … and then the spuds

Scrub the potatoes well, but don’t bother to peel them unless they’re very dirty; the skins add flavour. Cut them into medium dice – small enough to eat it in one mouthful, but not so small that they look likely to disintegrate. Add to the pan and stir to coat with hot butter.

5 Add the fish liquor

Pour the haddock cooking liquid into the pan, bay leaf and all, then bring to a simmer. Cook until the potato is tender, which will probably take 10-15 minutes, depending on the size of the chunks. Meanwhile, peel the skin off the haddock and discard (or feed to the dog); remove any bones and break the flesh into flakes.

6 Add the milk and fish, then blend

Once the potatoes are tender, use a slotted spoon to lift out a generous helping of cooked vegetables and set aside. Chuck the bay leaf into the compost bin. Pour the milk into the pan, along with half the flaked haddock (keep back the biggest chunks as garnish), then mash or blend the mix until fairly smooth.

7 Season and serve

Season to taste (the fish will probably be already quite salty, but you can never have too much pepper with a cullen skink – white, for preference, though black will also do perfectly well). Bring back to a simmer, then divide between bowls.

Add a spoonful of the reserved vegetables and haddock to each one, along with a sprinkling of chives.

8 And for a spot of luxury…

To make cullen skink extra luxurious (and who could blame you for feeling in need of small pleasures this year), stir in a few spoonfuls of double cream or creme fraiche at the end. You could also add a handful of mussels or prawns – steam the mussels separately and poach the prawns with the fish, whipping them out when they turn pink.

9 Optional extras

As this is a typically thrifty dish, you can use leftover mashed or chopped boiled potatoes instead (simply heat through before blending), or add other vegetables such as carrot or swede to the pan with the onion and leek. You could also use hot-smoked salmon, in which case skip the poaching step and use 300ml of weak fish stock instead of the cooking liquor.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
329,329,Report: UK Deploys Military INFOWAR Unit Against COVID Vaccine Skeptics,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The British government has mobilised an elite “information warfare” unit to combat “anti-vaccine militants” and interrupt their “propaganda content” online, according to a report in The Sunday Times.

The report (behind a paywall) says that the unit is usually used to assist with operations against al-Qaeda and the Taliban, but now will be turned on to those who dare question the sanctity of COVID vaccination.

The army has mobilised an elite “information warfare” unit renowned for assisting operations against al-Qaeda and the Taliban to counter online propaganda against vaccines, as Britain prepares to deliver its first injections within days. https://t.co/7JY2gl0oMj — The Times (@thetimes) November 29, 2020

The report further notes that the outfit known as ‘The defence cultural specialist unit’ was formed in Afghanistan in 2010 and is part of the army’s 77th Brigade.

“The secretive unit has often worked side-by-side with psychological operations teams,” the report adds.

Nice… The government employing the military to use psyops on the public to ensure no one strays from the acceptable opinion on the vaccine.



How is OperationWarpSpeed like Mickey’s Sorcerer’s Apprentice? Is the mRNA vaccine messing with something they can’t control? OWS is exactly what Bill Gates ordered with IA2030. Instead of $20 BILLION to build a wall, instead of military protecting US border, we have $20B for an untested experimental vaccine run by and delivered by the military.

The Times claims that the move was revealed by ‘leaked’ documents’.

“Soldiers are already monitoring cyberspace for Covid-19 content and analysing how British citizens are being targeted online,” it claims.

Of course, the government claims that muh Russians are involved… a way of confusing people into accepting the enforcement of group think by military spies.

“It is also gathering evidence of vaccine disinformation from hostile states, including Russia,” the report states.

Exactly what constitutes vaccine “disinformation” will be down to the government, and will likely make a target of anyone who points out potential side effects of vaccination, or questions the idea of mandating the jab, whether literally by law or by making it impossible to participate in society without it.

After the ‘leak’ came to light, the UK Ministry of Defence claimed that the unit is “not being directed at the UK population,” only at ‘hostile foreign actors’.

Yeah, OK.

Just like the GCHQ spook unit inside 10 Downing Street is also not targeted at the public.

A fortnight ago it was revealed by The London Telegraph (Paywall) that spies from Britain’s most secretive intelligence and security organisation have embedded a ‘cell’ at the heart of government to provide Prime Minister Boris Johnson with real time information pertaining to the public’s movements.

Words we didn't expect to read in 2020:



""GCHQ analysts have been given access to mobile phone data to track the public's movements during the national lockdown. The up-to-the-minute reports on compliance are passed to the Prime Minister""https://t.co/SKqk5uRw0z — Big Brother Watch (@BigBrotherWatch) November 19, 2020

The Daily Mail also reports on the development, which notes that GCHQ, normally tasked with spying on terrorists and foreign powers, has been turned on the British public to gauge whether people are following the COVID ‘rules’ or not, and to combat anti-vaccination material.

Speaking anonymously to the London Times in November, a source noted that “GCHQ has been told to take out antivaxers online and on social media. There are ways they have used to monitor and disrupt terrorist propaganda.”

The report noted that the spy agency was considering taking down websites and content that isn’t pro-vaccination, as well as ‘disrupting’ those creating the content by “using a toolkit developed to tackle disinformation and recruitment material peddled by Islamic State.”",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
760,760,'Motherhood is taboo in the art world – it's as if we've sold out': female artists on the impact of having kids,[],"‘Last night,” says Laima Leyton, “I went to bed with a sticky thought. I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramović. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn’t have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.”

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists – Leyton among them – about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar “sticky thought” has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

More time for her work? Laurie Anderson. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly’s condemnation of petty domesticity – “There is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall” – and Tracey Emin’s oft-quoted line: “There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.”

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. “I’ve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,” painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer’s wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report’s data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that’s not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected “blind”. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists’ careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn’t factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world – motherhood. My resulting essay – Full, Messy and Beautiful – was published alongside this year’s report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

“My experience,” Anna Perach told me, “is that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‘sold out’ or joined the bourgeoisie. It’s often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.”

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with “the holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids”, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can’t be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn’t come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn’t have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? “Paying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,” said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There’s now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities – buzz, aura, image – there is quite simply a problem of perception. “Women artists are marginalised generally,” as Jemima Burrill put it. “Mothers are almost beyond the pale.”

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are – and have been – great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that “sticky thought” that a woman cannot excel as both.

1117,1117,Microsoft Has Revealed Master Chief’s Teeth And They Are Filthy,[],"In a jaw-dropping reveal at the Onion Gamer’s Expo that’s almost 20 years in the making, Microsoft just teased Halo Infinite by giving gamers their first-ever glimpse of Master Chief’s teeth, and let’s just say that these things are absolutely filthy!

Xbox fanboys, looks like your dreams of getting an up-close-and-personal look at the Chief are finally being fulfilled—and his dental hygiene is more upsetting than anyone could have ever predicted.



Ever since we stepped foot into the legendary Spartan’s MJOLNIR armor way back in 2001 with Halo: Combat Evolved, the single-player campaigns have always left us with the same tantalizing question: What was going on inside that helmet? Well, with this sneak peek at the yellowed, cavity-ridden teeth inside of Master Chief’s mouth, we’re finally getting an answer, albeit a viscerally disturbing one that none of us specifically requested.



Of course, there is a distinct satisfaction to looking over the Chief’s gingivitis-plagued gum line and impacted molars and realizing this is the Spartan who saved the human race from the Covenant. But as rewarding as it is for fans to finally take a gander at the pieces of decayed meat caught up in his bleeding gums and crooked teeth, all of this just raises more tantalizing questions: “Doesn’t Master Chief ever brush his teeth?”; “Has he considered braces for those repulsive things?”; and “Isn’t he bothered by his apparently severe halitosis while he’s cooped up inside that metal suit?”

At the very least, this answers how the hero known as John-117 managed to avoid seeing a dentist even once as he fought countless battles against the Flood, as well as giving gamers a great reminder of how important regular visits with their dental hygienists are. Plus, getting this close to the Chief’s mouth—no matter how repulsive—just makes us more excited than ever to get our hands on Halo: Infinite! Here’s hoping it’s worth the wait.

916,916,Liverpool – Beatles & Merseybeat– 4 nights,[],"Day

2

Meet your Beatles-mad tour manager and head to the Mersey Ferry, which will take you across the languid Mersey. Ringo Starr used to work on the Mersey Ferry and the Beatles famously played a gig onboard a Mersey Ferry called the Royal Iris. Continue on coach to Port Sunlight. Founded in the 19th century to house factory workers, today Port Sunlight is a peaceful and picturesque village of Victorian-era houses, well-manicured gardens and cosy tea rooms. It was at Port Sunlight that the Beatles first played with Ringo Starr in the band, at Hulme Hall, which has since been converted into a wedding venue. The tour continues by coach and picks up the Beatles trail back in Liverpool. Drift back through time as you visit the Penny Lane Development Trust, with its colourful Beatles mural, and then the Strawberry Field Visitor Centre – both names etched in the consciousness of Beatles fans forever. Stop for a drink or a bite to eat (payable locally), before the tour continues past the childhood homes of John, Paul and Ringo, and their schools and colleges. You’ll pass the birthplaces of John Lennon and Brian Epstein – the Beatles’ legendary manager – before paying a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, the world’s fifth-largest and where Paul McCartney once auditioned for the local choir! Later today, enjoy an included visit to the Casbah Club, a former members-only club, widely regarded as the birthplace of the Merseybeat genre, that was run by Mona Best, mother of Beatles’ original drummer Pete Best. It was here that the young Beatles – then known as the Quarrymen – first performed, before they were signed – and refined – by Brian Epstein. Soak up the history as your tour guide regales you with early Beatles tales, and enjoy an hour of live music with an included drink in a club that was even decorated by the ‘Fab Four’ – look out for a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall painted by his first wife, Cynthia. Transfer back to your apartment at the end of a magical musical day, no doubt singing your favourite Beatles tune (either in your head or out loud!).",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
752,752,Nike Japan ad on teenage bullying and racism sparks debate,[],"A video made by Nike Japan that explores bullying and racism using three schoolgirl footballers has sparked praise and outrage online, including calls to boycott the company’s products.

The two-minute film, which was released on Monday, had racked up 14.2m views on Twitter by Wednesday afternoon and more than 63,000 likes. More than 16,000 people had commented. The YouTube version had been viewed almost 10m times.

Some social media users described the commercial as “amazing”, “powerful” and beautiful,” but others were less impressed.

While the film’s message clearly riled members of Japan’s online right – many of whom commented using pseudonyms – more measured critics said it misrepresented modern Japanese society.

“Is Japan really such a country full of discrimination? It feels like you’re creating a false impression of Japan,” said one user quoted by Soranews24.com.

Another wrote: “Nowadays, you often see one or two people of different nationalities going to school perfectly peacefully. The one that’s prejudiced is Nike.”

“Is it so much fun to blame Japan?” another asked.

A scroll through the first 50 or so comments revealed several by people saying they would never buy Nike products again.

Japan is a relatively homogenous society, but the heroics of the country’s multiracial rugby team at last year’s world cup and the success of tennis star Naomi Osaka, who has a Japanese mother and Haitian father, are challenging old ideas about what it means to be Japanese.

The Nike ad, titled The Future Isn’t Waiting, depicts three football-playing teenage girls from different backgrounds: one is Japanese, another is Korean and the third has a black father and Japanese mother.

In one scene, the mixed-race girl is surrounded by a group of classmates who touch her hair.

The Korean girl is shown reading on her smartphone about the “zainichi problem” – a word used to describe ethnically Korean people who are “staying in Japan”.

The Japanese girl, meanwhile, is bullied at school and struggles to cope with parental pressure to achieve academically.

In the end, the three are united by a desire to confront their problems and prove themselves through their love of football.

Osaka, who was named the world’s highest-earning female athlete earlier this year, is celebrated in the country of her birth, but her rise to tennis stardom revealed problematic attitudes in some sections of Japanese society.

An animated ad by one of Osaka’s sponsors, the Cup Noodle maker Nissin, portrayed her with with pale skin, wavy brown hair and Caucasian facial features, while a standup comedy act said she “looked sunburned” and “needed some bleach”.

Nike has not commented on the controversy but said on its website it believed in the ability of sport to transform lives.

“We have long listened to minority voices, supported and spoken for causes that fit our values,” it said. “We believe sports have the power to show what a better world looks like, to bring people together and encourage action in their respective communities.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

120,120,2017 Video Shows Democrat Raphael Warnock Believes ‘Racism’ Is ‘America’s Preexisting Condition’,['Ashley Oliver'],"Rev. Raphael Warnock preached in 2017 that “America’s preexisting condition” is “racism” during at least two of the several speeches and sermons Warnock has given that have come under scrutiny for their radical messaging.

Warnock, the senior pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church, said at a New Baptist Covenant event on June 29, 2017, that he “would not be a prophet” if he did not inform his audience “that racism is America’s preexisting condition”:



Warnock said in the clip New Baptist Covenant shared from the event:

We are in a special moment. We are in an evil moment. We are in a tragic moment, and I suggest to you that our politics is symptomatic of our sickness. We’ve got a lot of problems, but I would not be a prophet if I did not tell you that racism is America’s preexisting condition. Like the insurance companies, nobody wants to go there. Nobody wants to cover it because we wonder what it would cost. We, the land of the free, and the incarceration capital of the world. In this land where we warehouse 25 percent of the world’s prisoners although we are only five percent of the world, we are to ask ourselves what has it cost us not to cover it, not to face up to it, not to confront it, not to deal with it. Racism is America’s preexisting condition.

Warnock also preached in a video compilation dubbed “2017Year Ender” that racism, classism, bigotry, and xenophobia comprise America’s “preexisting condition”:

Warnock said, “America has a preexisting condition. It’s called racism. It’s called classism. It’s called bigotry. It’s called xenophobia. And we need God to heal us of our preexisting condition.”

As Warnock pursues unseating Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in Georgia’s highly consequential Senate runoff race on January 5, Warnock’s connection to provocative and racially charged rhetoric has come into the spotlight.

Warnock appeared on Fox News in 2008 and defended Jeremiah Wright, who served as former pastor to President Barack Obama and is known for a number of incendiary statements — which Obama himself has condemned — including declaring that “America’s chickens are coming home to roost” in regard to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and giving an impassioned speech in which he repeatedly shouted “God damn America.”

Warnock said in 2016 just before the presidential election that “America needs to repent for its worship of whiteness on full display.”

Warnock has twice praised Dr. James Cone and described Cone as his “mentor.” Cone claimed to fight racism but employed a wealth of anti-white language, including decrying “satanic whiteness” and calling for the “destruction of everything white” in society.

In addition to comparing racism in America to a preexisting medical condition, Warnock has made a string of anti-police remarks, including that “we shouldn’t be surprised when we see police officers act like bullies on the street” and that “often those who are sworn to protect cause more trouble.”

Warnock responded to criticism of his past comments in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution interview in March this year, saying, “Any fair-thinking person would recognize that everything a government does, even the American government, is not consistent with God’s dream for the world.”

404,404,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the “certain knowledge” that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that “the scientists have done it”, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with “over-optimism”, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

When and how will I be able to get a Covid vaccine in the UK? Read more

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: “We’re no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.”

He added: “We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.”

There were still “immense logistical challenges”, he said. “So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it’s all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we’re not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.”

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning’s press conference announcing the vaccine’s approval. “And what a momentous … journey and international effort it has been,” Van-Tam said. “Discovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.”

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. “If we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‘Oh, the vaccine’s here, let’s abandon caution,’ all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.”

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a “complex product” and “really tricky to handle”, explaining: “It’s not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.”

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was “going to eradicate coronavirus ever”, but we may get to the point where it becomes “a seasonal problem” like flu. He added: “Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party … and say, ‘That’s it, it’s behind us,’ like the end of the war? No, I don’t.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

997,997,"Strictly dropped us after we asked to be paid, say musicians",[],"A group of professional musicians have said they were dropped by Strictly Come Dancing after they asked to be paid for performing on the programme’s spinoff show.

Amaraterra, a band who perform traditional southern Italian music, said they were excited when they were approached by producers who were enthusiastic about them appearing on the BBC companion programme It Takes Two.

However, when they asked for a fee to compensate them for a day’s work the BBC producers told them, in emails seen by the Guardian: “We just don’t have money in the budget to pay for contributors.” Instead, they were offered a free lunch and it was suggested that they would receive a “decent amount of screen time, as well as a mention of your group name”, which would help boost the band’s following on Instagram and Facebook.

“Hopefully, when things return back to normal, and the arts is final[ly] restored, taking part in this [recording] for such a great show will be of benefit to you,” they were told by the show’s producer, who wanted them to perform with the professional dancers Nadiya Bychkova and Graziano Di Prima.

Band member Cassandre Balosso-Bardin said the band responded by asking the BBC to honour the relatively low rates agreed with the Musicians’ Union for session work, in addition to to the hours of practice required. They then did not hear back for several days, only to be told the show had dropped them.

The performer told the Guardian she was tired of musicians being expected to work for free. She said: “The days of ‘it’ll give you exposure’ (something all musicians will be all too familiar with) are over. What exposure? For what? We won’t get any gigs these days and we won’t sell any albums as we have none to sell, not being able to afford its production … They want us and our expertise, but they won’t pay for it.”

Balosso-Bardin said the inability to perform live during the pandemic had left some of her band members struggling to survive: “Like all other musicians, our gigs have been cancelled since March. We haven’t raised the funds to be able to produce our latest album. We created a few YouTube videos but haven’t monetised any of our work as it feels unfair to our followers, most of whom are just as hard-up as we are.

“We do not know when our next gig will be, and many of the band members are either furloughed or on universal credit. And the current Covid allowance for the self-employed (20% of your income), when 56% of musicians make less than £20,000 a year, is a pittance.”

She highlighted the difference between the high salaries paid to Strictly’s hosts, judges, and dancers and the attitude towards musical guests.

She said: “Externally, people may think: wow, you made it, you got a showcase on Strictly! Is making it not getting paid for your expertise, for your specialist labour? Is making it getting your whole culture trod on, used for entertainment with no financial remuneration? Making it is finding the voice to fight for your art, even if you have to turn the bling down.”

A BBC spokesperson said the decision to drop the band from the programme was made for editorial reasons, rather than because they asked for a fee. They said: “As we do with lots of artists, we discussed a proposed performance with Amaraterra for It Takes Two that ultimately didn’t happen for editorial reasons.”

Despite producers telling the band repeatedly there was no budget available, the BBC spokesperson insisted they would have been eligible to be paid. They said: “Had they performed they would of course have been paid for their appearance.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many of Thunberg’s followers agreed with her, others did not.

“I hate to do this, but I NEED a PS5,” one user commented.

“I don’t take orders from clueless adolescents,” another person said.

Despite Thunberg’s warnings, consumer spending has been strong since the economy began reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic, writes Breitbart News’s John Carney:

Many consumers are feeling flush, their wealth boosted by a stock market that has pushed the S&P 500 up 65 percent since the lockdown low in March and soaring home values. Money not spent on trips, sports games, movies, or eating out has apparently gone into the purchase of consumer goods and contributed to savings accounts of many households.

“Black Friday was traditionally the day when many retailers first turned a profit for the year,” Carney noted.

However, those promoting Black Friday sales appeared not to draw the same size crowds this year as in previous years.

“While the hustle and bustle of the holiday season has not completely disappeared, it is demonstratively lower this year due to fears, protocols, and limitations caused by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic,” Breitbart News reported.

Photos and video footage shared online showed small crowds and a few relatively empty parking lots:

890,890,'The equals of Klee and Matisse' – the Alabama quilt-makers who shook America,[],"Loretta Pettway Bennett remembers well the moment everything changed for her tight-knit, rural community. The 20th century was drawing to a close. She was in her late 30s, living with her husband and sons on the site of an old cotton plantation on a deep bend in the Alabama River. Any spare time she could muster was spent stitching quilts alongside her grandmother, mother and aunt, to pile on beds or hang on walls to stop the damp river air from snaking in between the logs of their cabin walls.

Then, in 1997, along came a collector who started to snap up the quilts for crazy money, and talked them up as works of art worthy of being shown in museums. “It seemed like a good idea, but at the time we didn’t believe it. Who would want to see these raggedy old quilts?” says Pettway Bennett. Up until then, the quilts might sell for a few dollars apiece, a handy enough boost to the economy of the 200-strong hamlet, which had been identified decades earlier as part of the poorest region in the US. Renamed Boykin in the 1940s, it was still known locally by its slave-era name of Gee’s Bend.

The collector was Bill Arnett, a white free-wheeling enthusiast who had made a specialism of what he called “black vernacular art”. Five years later he proved his point. An exhibition was mounted at Houston’s Museum of Fine Arts, which one of the curators involved in researching and staging it predicted was “going to change art history”. The 2002 show would go on to New York and to 11 other cities across the US, presenting connoisseurs with startling evidence that women cut off from international art movements were creating work that, as the New York Times noted, was the equal of anything by Klee or Matisse.

Pettway Bennett was among the quilters who were driven in buses to the launch of the exhibition, where they were treated like royalty and entertained the cosmopolitan arts crowd with “songs of sorrow” from their devout, plantation culture. A documentary made at the time captures the two-way excitement of the occasion – quilters who had never before set foot in a gallery marvelling at their own handiwork on the walls, and viewers moved to tears by its artistry and its cultural importance. “That the art is so full of love and patriotism and hope is very moving,” said Jane Fonda, who is one of their longest-standing champions, and whose daughter, Vanessa Vadim, was briefly married to Arnett’s son, Matt. “The rest of us can get cynical and angry but these people, of all people, should be and are not.”

Love and hope are all very fine, but Pettway Bennett – like all the quilters – was also a pragmatist. On her return from Houston she set to work, collecting up every scrap of denim she could find from clothes her husband and sons had abandoned or grown out of, to capitalise on this sudden success. The resulting quilt – a crazy-paving of patch pockets and scuffed knees finished in 2003 – now hangs in the Alison Jacques Gallery in London in what is believed to be the first European exhibition dedicated to the Gee’s Bend quilters’ work.

The 13 quilts in the exhibition span 90 years in the life of six families, many of them named Pettway after the 19th-century landowner who had transported their forefathers to Gee’s Bend to work on his cotton plantation. The oldest was made by Annie E Pettway in 1930, when the price of cotton slumped, reducing the community to such penury that they had to be fed by the Red Cross. Its sombre colours – typical of the period – make a vivid contrast to the geometrical exuberance of one made by Annie’s daughter, Rita Mae, in 2019. Both are constructed in a “block style” that is one of the design standards on which expert quilters improvised.

Pettway Bennett started learning how to sew quilts at the age of five or six. “As a little child we had the job of threading needles, and they’d let us practise on some real small pieces just to keep our hands busy,” she says. She completed her own first solo effort one summer when she was around 13, “but it was all lopsided and my mom finished it.” It was given to one of her brothers who has no memory of it. He probably used it to work on a car, which was the fate of many quilts that got old and raggedy, she says.

Arnett was driven in his pursuit of African American art by a conviction that there must be a visual equivalent to jazz and blues. When he first arrived at Gee’s Bend, he would find fabulous improvisations stashed beneath mattresses. Legend has it that one quilter had burned her whole collection just a week before he showed up.

Introducing the catalogue for the landmark show, art historian Alvia Wardlaw – now director of Texas Southern University Museum – captured the emotion of the occasion. The quilts, she wrote, were created “between picking cotton, braiding hair, soothing the furrowed brow of an overworked husband … [Each] is a statement of bold independence, almost defiant in a sense, because in the midst of such near tragic epic sagas of poverty and misery, [its maker] has had the audacity to create something bright and beautiful that has never been seen before and will never be seen quite that way again, and it is all hers, it came out of her own head from beneath a bandana in the blazing sun.”

Eighteen years later, on the other side of the world, the quilts still pack an emotional punch, each one carrying stories that are both unique to them and reflective of a wider history. The fabric on several is worn away to reveal lint linings made from fibres scrounged from the gin-houses where raw cotton was combed free of seeds. Those from the 1970s were often made from corduroy offcuts – like Qunnie’s “Housetop” – after a cooperative set up to provide paying work for the women won a contract from the retailer Sears to produce corduroy pillows.

Many also carry stains that hark back to previous lives as part of family homes; one has a small blue inkblot that might have been left by a child doing homework in bed. “Normally this sort of mark would be removed as part of the conservation process, but they are part of the autobiography of these quilts,” says gallery director Hannah Robinson, who is hoping that major European museums will take an interest in the quilts. A private collector has already bought one for the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, and the Tate is considering a further two.

The relationship of the quilters with the international art market has, perhaps inevitably, had its hiccups. Arnett, who died this summer, has several times been accused of exploiting them. A suit for fraud brought against him by the families of two Gee’s Bend quilters was dismissed in 2007. It is a charge that Pettway Bennett strongly disputes today. “I do believe that the intentions were good, but I don’t think the children of the quilters understood what he did for us,” she says. The London exhibition is a collaboration with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, which Arnett set up to safeguard his collection. Its website celebrates the lives of more than 120 Gee’s Bend quilters whose work Arnett bought over the years.

It is lunchtime on Thanksgiving holiday when I phone Pettway Bennett, and she hurries off to turn the heat down on the food that she is busy cooking for the three young men in her family. It’s not turkey: no, no, no, she says. They are Jehovah’s Witnesses, so have no truck with national celebrations. She was widowed a couple of years ago, and has recently moved to a smaller house, so has not been quilting for a while, but she hopes to get back to it once she is properly settled in. There aren’t many quilters among the younger generations, she says – at 60, she is the youngest in the show. They all still have quilts on their beds, “but our houses are better insulated now, so the quilts are just for decoration”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

472,472,How drawing comics is helping me mentally survive lockdown,[],"I’m sitting at a cafe table in Paris, wearing impractically high-heeled boots, sipping espresso and blowing cigarette smoke into the air. Here I am swimming in the deep ocean, making friends with an octopus.

One week after our state declared official lockdown, I found a way to travel safely, without mask or temperature checks, to explore other worlds and discover a sense of possibility that I acutely miss.

I first suggested the comics class to four friends who share my love of the cartoonist Lynda Barry. We didn’t know how long the lockdown would last, and doing exercises from Barry’s book, Making Comics, seemed like a fun way to pass time now that we were homebound. Armed with three-by-five index cards, blank paper and black Flair pens, we’ve diligently followed Barry’s class syllabus, starting each session by drawing a three-minute “attendance card”, from a list of ideas. Draw yourself as a vegetable. Draw yourself as a bearded lady. Draw yourself digging your way to freedom. Draw yourself as a French person.

I’ve discovered it feels good to be someone else, even for an hour, each week.

During the pandemic, many activities I love (eating out, visiting friends) are forbidden. I’m often too anxious to read for any length of time, and writing’s a challenge. With the country alternately on fire or on the verge of civil war, topics that seemed pressing in early 2020 now seem trite. Social media offer distraction and solidarity but also keep me glued to the news cycle and remind me what I should be doing, like contacting voters in Georgia for the January runoffs.

Drawing is one of few remaining activities that actually calms me.

As a kid, I loved drawing more than anything. My dad was a single parent and poet. Whenever I accompanied him to readings, he set me up in a corner with paper and pencils. There, I created whole cities hidden in clouds, or at the bottom of the sea. Birds became passenger planes, fish swam alongside mermaids and their mer-families. In high school, I entered and placed in a few art contests. But when I left home for college, drawing moved from the center of my pages to the margins. It became something I let myself do when my mind was wandering but never permitted myself to devote real time to. I didn’t believe I was good enough. I thought I should focus on finding a job to support myself.

I stuffed my drawing self in the back of the closet like an outfit I used to love and couldn’t bear to give away. It’s meaningful, but does it still fit? If I put it on, will I look like myself, or like someone in costume, pretending?

But now, with desk-time in abundance, drawing has become my refuge. Unlike with my other work – writing, reporting, teaching – I never worry if I’m doing it right or wrong. My only audience is those four supportive friends on Zoom. We make our drawings, then share them, laughing at each other and at ourselves. After meeting for more than 32 weeks, we’ve exhausted Lynda Barry’s attendance cards. Now we’ve come up with our own prompts: Draw yourself moderating the debate. Draw yourself nursing old wounds. Draw yourself as Uncle Sam. It feels like creativity for creativity’s sake, and it’s surprisingly therapeutic.

Take an assignment called Monster Jam: Draw four sets of scribbles, then transform each into a different monster. The monsters become characters with dialogue, backstories, family portraits: a whole life. Drawing my monster on his deathbed helped me sit with the idea of so many now dying of Covid-19, surrounded by hospital staff instead of family.

Cartooning has taught me how to live with the unknown. Some exercises require that you draw with your eyes closed, or with your non-dominant hand. With so much that’s unpredictable – will Massachusetts get its infection numbers down, how long will my daughter be learning remotely, will Donald Trump ever concede this election? – it feels good to let go of the “perfect drawing” and instead be delighted by whatever shows up.

When I was little, my dad used to make drawings in an effort to conquer my fear of monsters. He drew me beating up and throwing out the window a monster who’d burst into my bedroom. He thought if he drew me acting fearless, I’d no longer be a scaredy cat. That didn’t quite work out. This anxious child has grown into an anxious adult, made more anxious by these unusual times.

But I can turn to drawing as an act of becoming. I’m a tightrope walker balancing over a shark-infested sea. I’m floating in outer space, miles above Earth’s problems. I can fight my monsters by drawing my monsters. With paper and ink, I can imagine all of us out of this chaotic world.

1001,1001,World is ‘doubling down’ on fossil fuels despite climate crisis – UN report,[],"The world’s governments are “doubling down” on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid “severe climate disruption”. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

“The pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,” said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

“Alas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death – it’s kind of zombie energy.”

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: “With governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year’s devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.”

“The research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,” said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world’s fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

“It’s a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we’re beginning to see that happen,” said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: “Working together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.”

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: “Governments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies – this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we’re going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.”

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to “show climate leadership” by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: “The world – and its people – are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
350,350,Mt Toubkal Long Weekend - Winter,[],"Mt Toubkal, you tricky customer

With our 50th birthdays looming, a few friends decided to take on a challenge. Onto the Exodus website we went... All 4 of us are fairly fit so decided a ""challenging"" level would be just the ticket! Mt Toubkal did not disappoint! It was definitely a challenge! Who knew it could rain and snow so much in August? Because we followed the trip notes, universal packing and read some reviews, we believed we were ready! We just didn't account for the altitude sickness! This took 3 of us out and only one of us made it to the summit.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip? For me, it was the summit and just before! The hours before the summit were extremely difficult as you are hiking in the dark with just a head torch, following the boots of the person in front. It was steep, raining/hailing so it was slow going. When we stopped just shy of the summit, we witnessed the most amazing sight: A rainbow over the High Atlas Mountains! It was worth all the rain to see this sight. After waking up at 330am, hiking for 4+ hours, the summit was a sight to behold! (even if it was snowing in August... in Morocco... yes, snow in August!)

What did you think of your group leader? Ilyas our group leader and Abdul his assistant were amazing!!! With 3 of my friends ill with altitude sickness, Abdul took incredible care of them. Both Ilyas and Abdul have a great sense of humour and made us all laugh. After 2 days we understood ""Ilyas time"" (ie 5 min in our time is 10 in Ilyas time) and his love of telling time in seconds! Ilyas organised our day well and I now miss someone telling me when to wake up, when to eat and when to start walking! They both gave us a great insight into Moroccan culture and the religion of Islam. I have left knowing I will have a ""home away from home"" in Morocco! Ilyas also organised tours and spa visits on our last day in Marrakesh. He was great!!

Do you have any advice for potential travellers? Be prepared! Be fit! It is definitely NOT a walk in the park. Pack for all weathers including a rain cover for your day pack or at least a dry bag for inside the pack. Also I found sticks a must for descending. And have a head torch, not just a hand held torch because you need your hands to clamber over large rocks ets (also bring extra batteries just in case). Because you start and finish the summit ascent at the refuge, make sure you have clean dry WARM clothes ready for your return to the refuge. Drinks are not served with dinner at the refuge so make sure you have money to buy a drink from the shop or have a bottle of water ready. Also make sure you have dirham change for the hike as you stop at various places to buy juices on the way to the refuge. They won't take big denominations of dirham. Also, its best to have EUROs or Dirhams. Not many places were happy with £ or USD.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
292,292,“Dark Winter” Was The Code Name For A Scenario In Which A Biological Weapon Was Used Against The American Populace,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Could it be possible that the phrase “dark winter” has some sort of deeper meaning that most of us are not meant to understand?

We have heard that phrase over and over again in recent weeks, and usually it has been used in discussions regarding the current state of the COVID-19 pandemic.

But it also turns out that “Dark Winter” was also a code name for a high level simulation that was conducted back in 2001.

That simulation envisioned a scenario in which a widespread smallpox attack was unleashed inside the United States.

As you will see below, the simulation was “designed to spiral out of control”, and the hypothetical consequences were absolutely disastrous.

Callers all over the nation are demanding the world arrest the criminals trying to steal the elction and getting away with it.

The reason why this is a concern is because so many of these “simulations” and “exercises” end up mirroring real life events that happen at a later date.

For example, most of you have probably heard about Event 201 by now. On October 18th, 2019 a group of prominent individuals gathered in New York City to simulate what would happen during a worldwide coronavirus pandemic…

Event 201 simulates an outbreak of a novel zoonotic coronavirus transmitted from bats to pigs to people that eventually becomes efficiently transmissible from person to person, leading to a severe pandemic. The pathogen and the disease it causes are modeled largely on SARS, but it is more transmissible in the community setting by people with mild symptoms.

Of course COVID-19 started spreading in China just a few weeks later.

We have seen this same pattern happen so many times, and now we are being told over and over again that a “dark winter” is ahead.

For example, Joe Biden specifically warned us about a “dark winter” during the final presidential debate in October…

Joe Biden warned at Thursday night’s presidential debate that the U.S. was “about to go into a dark winter,” echoing the concerns of public health experts who caution about increased daily Covid-19 case counts converging with the annual flu season. “We’re about to go into a dark winter. A dark winter,”Biden said. “And he has no clear plan, and there’s no prospect that there’s going to be a vaccine available for the majority of the American people before the middle of next year.”

It is interesting to note that he repeated the phrase twice.

It is almost as if he was determined to make sure that he said it correctly.

And then he started using the phrase over and over again on the campaign trail and he kept using it even after the voting was over.

For example, here is an instance where he used the phrase on the Monday after the election…

Joe Biden on Monday warned that a “very dark winter” is approaching as the U.S. coronavirus case count nears 10 million. “There is a need for bold action to fight this pandemic,” Biden said in Delaware. “We’re still facing a very dark winter.”

I never thought too much about his use of that phrase, but could it be possible that it is actually some sort of a code word or signal?

We do know that it was a code word for a high level exercise that was held in 2001. The following comes from Wikipedia…

It is interesting to note that smallpox is a highly infectious disease that involves sores appearing on the skin.

For those that have read my latest book, you already understand why that detail is so important to me.

And as I already mentioned above, this exercise was specifically designed “to spiral out of control”…

Dark Winter’s simulated scenario involved an initial localized smallpox attack on Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, with additional smallpox attack cases in Georgia and Pennsylvania. The simulation was then designed to spiral out of control. This would create a contingency in which the National Security Council struggles to determine both the origin of the attack as well as deal with containing the spreading virus. By not being able to keep pace with the disease’s rate of spread, a new catastrophic contingency emerges in which massive civilian casualties would overwhelm America’s emergency response capabilities.

Could it be possible that Biden and others are using the phrase “dark winter” to signal that something is about to spiral out of control?

I don’t know. I am just asking the question.

In Operation Dark Winter, the spread of smallpox also resulted in a “massive loss of civilian life”…

The disastrous contingencies that would result in the massive loss of civilian life were used to exploit the weaknesses of the U.S. health care infrastructure and its inability to handle such a threat. The contingencies were also meant to address the widespread panic that would emerge and which would result in mass social breakdown and mob violence. Exploits would also include the many difficulties that the media would face when providing American citizens with the necessary information regarding safety procedures. Discussing the outcome of Dark Winter, Bryan Walsh noted “The timing–just a few months before the 9/11 attack–was eerily prescient, as if the organizers had foreseen how the threat of terrorism, including bioterrorism, would come to consume the U.S. government and public in the years to come.”[4]

So let me try to summarize what we have learned.

Operation Dark Winter envisioned a scenario in which a highly infectious disease that causes sores on the skin spirals out of control and causes a “massive loss of civilian life”.

And suddenly Joe Biden and other elitists have begun repeating this phrase over and over again as we head into 2021.

642,642,'There's a gaping hole in our knowledge': the scientists studying why gamers invert their controls,[],"It is one of the most contentious aspects of video game playing – a debate where opposing sides literally cannot see each other’s perspective. When the Guardian ran an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls – meaning that they push their joypad’s thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen – the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.

The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.

Now, one of the scientists interviewed for that article, Dr Jennifer Corbett, co-head of the Visual Perception and Attention Lab at Brunel University London, is taking the matter further. Inspired by the ensuing debate, she and colleague Dr Jaap Munneke have begun an exploratory study looking into the science behind controller inversion. With backgrounds in vision science and cognitive neuroscience, Corbett and Munneke have employed a variety of research methods, from neuro-imaging to computational modelling to psychophysics, in their previous work. Now, with the help of seven psychology students, they will be running remote behavioural and psychophysical experiments using volunteer gamers aged between 18 and 35.

“Although it’s not per se a topic we’d study in our lab, we’d had to pause regular EEG and eye-tracking experiments due to Covid and shift to online experiments,” explains Corbett. “This was the perfect opportunity to pursue such a question, especially given how much this has excited the hardcore gamers in our lab.”

So what will the experiments with volunteers involve? “Generally, we will be measuring how fast and accurately people are able to mentally rotate shapes and the extent to which they rely on different body and contextual cues when making spatial judgments,” says Corbett. “There are no right or wrong answers in these tasks – we’re interested in how people might perform differently. We’ll obtain one or two measures – for example, average reaction time, average accuracy – from each participant in each of four short computerised online experiments and then correlate these measures with information from a questionnaire about gaming habits that each participant will also complete.”

From this exploratory study, Corbett and her team hope to gain insight into how an individual’s visual perceptual abilities may affect how they interact with both real and virtual environments. “For example,” she says, “it may be the case that the extent to which a person relies on visual versus bodily context has a huge influence on whether or not they choose to invert the Y axis on their gaming consoles.”

The results of the study could have more important ramifications than helping inverters appreciate non-inverters and vice versa. “Understanding the factors that drive human visual perception is useful for almost all aspects of gaming and visual technologies,” says Corbett. “Most research focuses on how people pay attention to individual objects, but humans can’t really process more than a few details at once. There’s a gaping hole in our knowledge regarding how our visual perception is heavily dependent on the rest of this vast majority of sensory information. Being able to predict how a person will interact within a given environment or context can bring about monumental advancements in technology.”

Corbett argues that learning how individuals differ in terms of the interactions between visual information (what’s on the screen) and motor behaviour (how the controller is used) will have a benefit to game designers, allowing them to optimise their controls. But also, appreciating that each person may have a given pattern of performance on mental rotation and perspective-taking tasks, could have much wider applications.

“Such findings may inform us about ways to maximise performance for pilots using ‘real’ flight consoles,” says Corbett. “In a broader context, understanding these sorts of individual differences can help us better predict where to place important information and where to double-check for easily missed information in everything from VR gaming to safety-critical tasks like detecting weapons in baggage scans or tumours in X-rays.”

So, what started as an existential argument between Guardian-reading game players may well end up informing a new understanding of visual perception and sensory input. In a world where an increasing number of our interactions are happening in digital and virtual spaces, understanding why some people push down to look up has never been more vital or less nerdy.

• Jennifer Corbett is looking for gamers between the ages of 18 and 35 to take part in the study, which will involve four online computerised visual perception tasks and a questionnaire about gaming habits.

Joe Biden, the US president-elect, formally introduced his top economic advisers on Tuesday, as his incoming administration prepares to deal with the worst financial crisis in decades and a resurgent coronavirus pandemic.

Bipartisan group pitches $908bn Covid-19 relief to break deadlock in Congress Read more

Wearing a black boot on the right foot he recently fractured while playing with one of his dogs, Biden appeared in his home city, Wilmington, Delaware, for an event that stressed the gravity of the situation but sought to offer hope.

“We’re going to create a recovery for everybody,” Biden said. “Our message to everybody struggling right now is this: help is on the way.”

Biden’s nominations would put several women in top economic roles, drawing a clear contrast with Donald Trump and reflecting his commitment to diversity.

They include Janet Yellen, who if confirmed by the Senate will be the first woman to lead the US treasury in its 231-year history. Biden said he “might have to ask Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the musical about the first treasury secretary, [Alexander] Hamilton, to write another musical” about his new nominee.

Yellen led the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, focusing on maximising employment and less on price inflation. In remarks on Tuesday, she noted the damage caused by the pandemic.

“Lost lives, lost jobs, small businesses struggling to stay alive or closed for good,” she said. “So many people struggling to put food on the table and pay bills and rent.

“It’s an American tragedy and it’s essential we move with urgency. Inaction will cause a self-reinforcing downturn, causing yet more devastation. And we risk missing the obligation to address deeper structural problems.”

Biden’s nominees have all expressed support for government spending to boost employment, reduce inequality and help women and people of colour, disproportionately harmed by the downturn.

But they will face stiff headwinds from the pandemic, now estimated to be killing one American a minute. The US has 4% of the world’s population but 19% of its coronavirus deaths – more than 268,000 – with record caseloads and hospitalisations forcing renewed economic restrictions in some states.

November saw the biggest two-week jump in unemployment benefit applications since April. Several aid programmes are set to expire this month, although a bipartisan group of House and Senate members unveiled a $908bn relief bill on Tuesday in an effort to break a political stalemate.

Biden said: “The team I’m announcing today will play a critical role in shaping our plan for action starting on day one and move fast to revive this economy.”

His “Build Back Better” plan, he said, was based on a simple proposition: “Reward hard work in America, not wealth. It’s time to invest in infrastructure, clean energy, climate change, manufacturing and so much more that will create millions of good-paying jobs.

Other picks include Cecilia Rouse, an economist at Princeton University who would be the first Black woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers; the economists Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein as council members; and Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress thinktank, as head of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

“I’ve known Neera a long time,” Biden said. “A brilliant policy mind with critical practical experience across government. She was raised by a single mom on food stamps, an immigrant from India who struggled, worked hard and did everything she could for her daughter to live out the American dream, and Neera did just that. She understands the struggles millions of Americans are facing.”

Biden noted that Tanden would be the first woman of colour to run the OMB. But she has already proved his most divisive pick, drawing criticism from Republicans. Some analysts suggest she is a “sacrificial lamb”, likely to be denied confirmation in a fight that might distract attention from other nominees.

Since being nominated, Tanden has deleted more than a thousand tweets, some of which were critical of senators who will vote on her confirmation, the Daily Beast reported.

Claire McCaskill, a former senator from Missouri, told MSNBC: “It’s a whole new level of hypocrisy. The Republican senators are now all of a sudden worried about tweets that hurt their feelings. This is just ridiculous.

“We’ve had a president who has used his Twitter account like a battering ram, going after not just his political opponents but Republican senators, unfairly, with incredibly brutal tweets. Now all of a sudden it’s a disqualification for someone to serve in the cabinet that engaged in her own opinion on Twitter? I think that’s dumb.”

Tanden has also been unpopular on the left, having been a staunch supporter of Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary. Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Sanders’s 2020 campaign, tweeted: “Everything toxic about the corporate Democratic party is embodied in Neera Tanden.”

For Biden, Tuesday’s sober and determined presentation was the latest sign that the transition is gathering unstoppable momentum despite Trump’s false claims of vote rigging and refusal to concede.

On Monday, Biden received his first full classified intelligence briefing since winning the 3 November election, after Trump delayed the process for weeks. And Arizona and Wisconsin officially recognised Biden’s victory, meaning Trump’s legal team has lost six of six attempts to stop states certifying their results. Trump has pursued challenges in numerous states but most have been tossed out.

Yet the president continues his quixotic effort. The Trump campaign on Tuesday asked the Wisconsin supreme court to determine if 221,000 absentee ballots that allegedly lacked information should be excluded from vote totals. Biden won the state by about 20,000 votes.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill’s father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher’s F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

Hamilton 'devastated' after Covid-19 positive puts rest of his season in doubt Read more

“There is a sense that some people don’t want you to have a go,” says Hill. “I felt like some people felt: ‘Why is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.’ It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.”

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

“I wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad’s life and career and applied them to my racing.

“Jacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.”

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

“It really is tragic what happened to Michael,” he says. “Mick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.”

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

“I have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn’t strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.”

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher’s best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

“In a way it’s very simple – if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,” says Hill. “I will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
713,713,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world’s biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, “a lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?” Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry – but rarely their male counterparts – have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because “people wouldn’t find a mother as appealing”. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had “underestimated this whole mommy thing”.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry’s disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children’s perspective on her last album (“You say you’re going but you don’t say how long for / You say it’s work, but I’m not sure”). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US “nearly tore me apart”, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds – leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms – moving from the “female pop star” category to the even more restrictive “mum” box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

“I hardly ever get asked about being a father,” says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter’s future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly’s Tom Fletcher – whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I’m a Celebrity … contestant Giovanna Fletcher – says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

‘We knew we could have a support structure’ … Thurston Moore and daughter Coco in 1995. Photograph: John Zich/The LIFE Images Collection/Getty Images

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he “wasn’t as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‘Wow, I’m going to be responsible for another human being.’ So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.” Hot Chip’s Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children “get upset when I am about to go away”, they “understand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want”.

It’s not only their own family’s financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for – their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. “You don’t want to let anyone down by saying, ‘it would be great to do that festival, but we can’t because I can’t,’” he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. “I think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it’s our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.”

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician’s living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by “speeding back during the night” after shows, and then “doing the school run in the morning”. Do his peers see that as normal? “No,” he laughs. “They think that’s mad!” Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives’ respective due dates, but it wasn’t ideal. “If you’re in a band, people expect to see you on stage,” says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. “I don’t think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,” he later said. Fletcher – who had his first child “two weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career” – was equally untroubled by the experience. “It actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.”

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. “About 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live – we drove our family car with him,” he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife’s mother) travelled “all around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe”, an undertaking he describes as “pretty easy” and “not too hectic”.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sinéad O’Connor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth’s huge success during the decade: “We made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.” Any earlier “would have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.” Fletcher’s experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. “Everyone was there to give us everything we needed.”

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. “The only person who would ever do that is a band’s manager and they might say, ‘It’s going to impact on our finances’ or whatever,” says Goddard. “You’d have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.” The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. “Hot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,” Goddard says. “The band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.” Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules “pretty challenging”, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: “I’ll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out”.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of “mum guilt” – the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children – men have the much milder husband guilt. “My worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,” says Spearman, with Goddard adding: “There’s an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have – my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn’t have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.”

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. “I think it’s still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,” says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn’t mind him taking paternity leave, “if a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that’s different.” Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop – “there are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older” – as well as “the hormones, what happens to your body” that men don’t experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don’t have any children: “Men don’t really get those questions: ‘Are you going to settle down and have a child?’ Women must be asked about it all the time.” When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. “I would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‘I probably will have some kids.’”

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon’s work “was going to be interrupted”. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. “It’s good to be focused, but it’s also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It’s not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.” Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact – albeit only temporarily. “Having a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything – what my daughter would think in years to come.”

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood “didn’t have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.” Ghetts says “there’s a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood’s cool, fatherhood’s sick”.

Goddard is more ambivalent. “My coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.” Spearman says Everything Everything didn’t want to mention fatherhood “too much” in the press release for their new album, “because it makes us look a bit old. And it’s a bit of cliche to be like, ‘We’ve written a record about having a kid,’ which is not what our record is about. We don’t want to overstate it.”

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven’t noticed any real-world implications yet. “We got playlisted on Radio 1,” he says happily. “Not bad for a dad band!”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

910,910,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London’s Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: “Without the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

“Police took a measured response. You, however, didn’t engage with police – police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.”

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge – meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment – after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park’s Speakers’ Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by “addressing the gathering and encouraging … others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,” the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a “light-touch policing” approach by encouraging the gatherings to “disperse without the necessity for enforcement action”.

But Corbyn, he added, had “deliberately” participated in the gathering “by way of making public addresses” and that he allegedly “disregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period”.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 “is not a pandemic” and argue that “if it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us”.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: “This case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers’ Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

“Mr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.”

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A “blanket ban” on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: “We’ve had a tremendous result.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

89,89,Report: Over a Quarter of Small Businesses in New York and New Jersey Closed This Year,['Hannah Bleau'],"Over a quarter of small businesses in New York and New Jersey, areas hit hardest by the Chinese coronavirus pandemic, have not reopened this year, according to a report from a Harvard-run database.

The database, TrackTheRecovery.org, revealed that 27.8 percent of small businesses in New York have not reopened following the mass shutdowns that occurred in the state this year, as of November 16. Even more businesses remained closed in New Jersey — 31.2 percent.

The New York Post reported:

The figures are in line with estimates from the New Jersey Business & Industry Association, which says 28 percent of the Garden State’s small businesses had shut up shop by the end of October, according to the Star Ledger newspaper. … More than half of small businesses in both states were forced to shut their doors in the spring at the height of the pandemic, with both hitting highs in mid-April — 52.5 percent of New York businesses and 53.9 percent in the Garden States, the stats show.

The news comes as virus rates begin to spike, prompting Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D) and Phil Murphy (D) to reintroduce restrictions in their respective states.

Murphy, who was recently confronted after dining out with his maskless family after retightening restrictions in the Garden State, told Fox News Sunday that a statewide lockdown remains “on the table.”

“It has to stay on the table. Gov. Hutchinson, I think, had a similar answer to that. You hate like heck to even have to consider that, and God willing, we won’t have to,” he said, calling for a “big federal stimulus,” which he believes will act as a “lifeline” for small businesses.

“That would be a game-changer. Not just in their lives and in their prospects, but it gives us more degrees of freedom in terms of dealing with the virus. So it’s on the table in terms of a shutdown,” he continued.

“I don’t anticipate it, and I sure as heck don’t want to go that route but boy, federal stimulus would give us a lot more ammunition to do a lot more things right now,” Murphy added.

State and local governments across the country are also taking action as virus rates increase, preemptively closing businesses deemed nonessential and limiting capacity limitations at essential retailers, forming what has been dubbed “modern breadlines” in states such as New Mexico ahead of its recent two-week lockdown.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
876,876,‘As consumers we all have tremendous impact’: why becoming climate positive is the business world's greatest challenge,[],"A scientist measures greenhouse gas emissions: some companies are trying to go beyond being carbon-neutral to actually removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Photograph: Izzet Noyan Yilmaz/Alamy Stock Photo

Ever-increasing global temperatures and warnings that we have just 10 years to alter the path we’re on if we’re to avoid rising sea levels and mass extinctions make it clear that things are getting serious. Unless you’re a climate science denier, you’ll be familiar with – and anxious to see something done about – a pretty bleak prognosis for the planet.

For all the good that many small businesses are doing on a local level to source more sustainable products and reduce global emissions, the importance of bigger, multinational companies leading by example cannot be overestimated. Although too few companies have yet pledged to become climate positive – going beyond achieving net zero carbon emissions to create an environmental benefit by removing additional carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – the ball has been set rolling by the likes of Ikea, BrewDog, Microsoft and Henkel, the company behind familiar products such as Schwarzkopf, Right Guard and Loctite. Each of these businesses faces its own challenges and is coming up with its own solutions.

Ikea can lean on the fact that many of its products are climate positive, being made principally from wood. Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, trapping the carbon element; it’s from logging, through production and transport to disposal, that the product accumulates its carbon footprint. The “natural carbon storage” of the trees, in tandem with a drive towards using only renewable energy, better forestry management and enabling customers to live low-energy lifestyles (via home solar panels and LED lights, for example), will help it reach its carbon-negative goal.

Microsoft’s target is even more ambitious. Carbon-neutral since 2012, the company plans to balance out all the emissions it has ever produced by 2050 by investing in sustainable technologies such as carbon sequestration. And in August of this year, beer brand BrewDog announced it had achieved its climate positivity targets by switching to wind power for its breweries.

Their methods may differ, but if these trailblazing companies share one thing, it’s a desire to stand up and tackle the problem. And that is true, too, for Henkel.

“For us, it’s a mindset,” says Uwe Bergmann, director, global sustainability at Henkel, which produces and markets adhesive technologies, laundry and beauty products in more than 100 countries, and is committed to being climate positive by 2040. “We decided it was better to be positive about this great global challenge, rather than aiming to be merely neutral or less of a problem. We’re embracing the challenge.”

To be climate positive, a company needs to draw more carbon from the atmosphere than it creates through its operations – ideally from raw material extraction through production, logistics and transport and consumer use, to disposal and recycling. It can achieve this by making concrete changes such as switching to renewable energy, or through more abstract ideas such as purchasing or generating energy credits or offsetting emissions through tree-planting initiatives.

For most companies, it’s the raw materials and consumer-use phases that account for the lion’s share of carbon emissions, and Henkel is no different: raw materials account for 27% and consumer use 66% of its emissions.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘We can’t force you to limit your time under the shower … but it’s in our interest that you are aware how you can contribute to climate protection,’ says Henkel’s Uwe Bergmann. Photograph: Brat Co/Stocksy United

The fact that these are outside the company’s direct influence presents challenges. “It’s hard to make reliable long-term commitments along the entire value chain when you rely on many actors,” says Bergmann. “Take our shower gels or body wash, for example: we can’t force you to limit your time under the shower or run the water a bit cooler. We can’t make you switch your energy supplier. But it’s in our interest that you are aware of how you can contribute to climate protection and continue to have showers and enjoy our products in the future.”

Despite production accounting for only a small proportion of Henkel’s global carbon footprint – just 2% compared with Ikea’s 11%, for example – the company is doing everything it can to refine its processes so they become ever more efficient, says Bergmann, for whom conversion to 100% renewable energy sources is a given. “Once we’ve converted to renewables, we will still want to become more efficient.”

Although the company has some on-site solar power generation at its sites – both thermal and photovoltaic – any ideas of having a wind turbine at its Dusseldorf headquarters were quickly scotched by zoning restrictions. Biomass combined heat and power plants, however, remain part of the company’s plans.

“If we have the right energy infrastructure in place – similar to the combined heat and power biomass system we have in Montornès del Vallès in Spain, for example – we will have more and more surplus renewable energy available for others,” says Bergmann. Passing this surplus energy on to third parties will enable Henkel to stride into climate-positive territory – so long as emissions are minimised elsewhere.

The company works with its suppliers to reduce the energy expended at the raw materials stage, but simultaneously seeks to develop smarter ingredients that use less energy and optimise its formulations. “When I was growing up, you had huge boxes of detergent and you dosed maybe 250ml-270ml of powder into a wash,” says Bergmann. “Today, with the most compact forms, that can be 35ml of concentrated liquid detergent. It’s quite a dramatic progress.” Less bulk equals less raw materials and less carbon emitted during transport.

One thing Bergmann is keen to stay clear of is offsetting: “The classic tree-planting offset is not part of our strategy. It sends the wrong signal and it’s too easy to do right now.” Critics of the system say a company can buy its way to carbon neutrality or negativity without seriously examining its own processes for every possible inefficiency and enacting every improvement. “The capacities of the planet for offsetting are limited,” Bergmann says.

At Henkel, the approach is to look for efficiencies and changes within. “We have a programme to help smallholder palm oil farmers way upstream in our supply chain improve their activities and switch to sustainable production that prohibits deforestation and therefore has a biodiversity and a climate benefit: the more productive farmers are, the less forest area you need to produce palm oil,” says Bergmann.

He points out that many products in the Henkel portfolio actively enable emission reductions in other industries: “Our products help to insulate buildings, make cars lighter and make pumps and solar panels more efficient. All of these things help our customers – and ultimately consumers – save energy and carbon.”

To help individual consumers quantify their carbon footprints, and encourage improvements in behaviour, Henkel has developed a carbon footprint calculator. Spend a few minutes answering basic questions about your lifestyle and you’ll get a detailed analysis of where improvements or compromises might be made. “You, me, all of us as consumers have a tremendous impact: how long to shower, what to eat, how to live, how to heat,” says Bergmann. “Do I trade my SUV against a large flat with tall ceilings, can I balance that by eating vegetarian?”

The latest calculator update takes into account new patterns of behaviour that may not be such obvious threats as driving a car or keeping your home cosy. “Video-conferencing and streaming services make up an increasing share of the global energy demand, especially with Covid-19,” says Bergmann.

Not everyone will be up for kicking their habits, but other decisions require less sacrifice. “Laundry won’t complain if you wash it cold, so that’s easier.

For all the company’s good work on a macro level, Bergmann believes fatalism on an individual level remains a threat.

573,573,US justice department investigates alleged 'bribery for pardon' scheme at White House,[],"An alleged “bribery for pardon” scheme at the White House is under investigation by the justice department, according to a court filing unsealed on Tuesday.

The heavily redacted document does not name Donald Trump or other individuals and leaves many unanswered questions, but comes amid media reports that the US president is considering sweeping pardons before he leaves office next month.

It shows that the justice department investigation alleges that an individual offered “a substantial political contribution in exchange for a presidential pardon or reprieve of sentence”.

Two individuals acted improperly as lobbyists to secure the pardon in the “bribery-for-pardon schemes”, as the document puts it. The names are blacked out.

On Tuesday night, a justice department official told Reuters that no US government official is the “subject or target” of investigation into whether money was funnelled to the White House in exchange for a presidential pardon.

Trump issued a brief response on Tuesday night, resorting to one of his favourite phrases to criticise the media even though the details were contained in official court papers. “Pardon investigation is Fake News!” he tweeted.

The watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) tweeted in response: “It’s hard to overstate how big a deal the phrase ‘bribery-for-pardon schemes’ is.”

The document was unsealed by the district court for the District of Columbia, in Washington. Some of its 20 pages are entirely redacted, implying that revealing the details now might jeopardise an ongoing investigation.

They discuss a review by chief judge Beryl Howell in late August of a request from prosecutors for documents gathered for the bribery investigation. More than 50 digital devices including iPhones, iPads, laptops, thumb drives and computer drives were seized after investigators raided unidentified offices. It was not clear why Howell decided to release the filing now.

Former Obama administration figure and Democratic presidential candidate Julián Castro tweeted: “In 2016, the FBI reopened an investigation into Hillary Clinton just 11 days before Election Day – but stayed quiet about an investigation into Trump. Now, we learn weeks after the 2020 election that the DoJ has been investigating Trump for a bribery-for-pardon scheme.

In 2016 the FBI were investigating Clinton’s use of a private server for professional emailing while secretary of state, but the public was not told at the time that the bureau had also begun the Russia investigation into allegations of collusion between the Trump election campaign and Moscow.

Trump last week pardoned Michael Flynn, his former national security adviser, who had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. The New York Times reported on Tuesday that Trump and Rudy Giuliani, his personal lawyer, discussed as recently as last week the possibility of a “pre-emptive pardon”. Giuliani tweeted a denial.

The court disclosure unleashed a whirlwind of speculation in Washington. The Democrat Adam Schiff, the chair of the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, told the MSNBC network: “People shouldn’t presume – and there may be a tendency to leap to the conclusion that this may involve some of the personalities that have been very much in the news and are worried about their criminal liability.

“It may be someone that we’ve never heard of that wants a pardon and is well-heeled and therefore in a position to make a sizable contribution. So it doesn’t have to be any of the parties that we think that may want a pardon: the [Paul] Manaforts, the Giulianis and others. It could be someone completely different but, at the end of the day, someone in that chain has to be close enough to the White House where they could conceivably deliver on the official act of pardon if the bribe were paid.”

Meet your Beatles-mad tour manager and head to the Mersey Ferry, which will take you across the languid Mersey. Ringo Starr used to work on the Mersey Ferry and the Beatles famously played a gig onboard a Mersey Ferry called the Royal Iris. Continue on coach to Port Sunlight. Founded in the 19th century to house factory workers, today Port Sunlight is a peaceful and picturesque village of Victorian-era houses, well-manicured gardens and cosy tea rooms. It was at Port Sunlight that the Beatles first played with Ringo Starr in the band, at Hulme Hall, which has since been converted into a wedding venue. The tour continues by coach and picks up the Beatles trail back in Liverpool. Drift back through time as you visit the Penny Lane Development Trust, with its colourful Beatles mural, and then the Strawberry Field Visitor Centre – both names etched in the consciousness of Beatles fans forever. Stop for a drink or a bite to eat (payable locally), before the tour continues past the childhood homes of John, Paul and Ringo, and their schools and colleges. You’ll pass the birthplaces of John Lennon and Brian Epstein – the Beatles’ legendary manager – before paying a visit to Liverpool Cathedral, the world’s fifth-largest and where Paul McCartney once auditioned for the local choir! Later today, enjoy an included visit to the Casbah Club, a former members-only club, widely regarded as the birthplace of the Merseybeat genre, that was run by Mona Best, mother of Beatles’ original drummer Pete Best. It was here that the young Beatles – then known as the Quarrymen – first performed, before they were signed – and refined – by Brian Epstein. Soak up the history as your tour guide regales you with early Beatles tales, and enjoy an hour of live music with an included drink in a club that was even decorated by the ‘Fab Four’ – look out for a silhouette of John Lennon on the wall painted by his first wife, Cynthia. Transfer back to your apartment at the end of a magical musical day, no doubt singing your favourite Beatles tune (either in your head or out loud!).",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
270,270,Poll: Majority Believe BLM Made Racial Tensions WORSE,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

A New survey has found that a majority of 55% of British people believe that the Black Lives Matter movement has enflamed racial tensions rather than improving the situation in the country.

The poll, conducted by Opinium, found that only 17% of respondents actually believe the movement has had a positive impact on race relations in the UK.

Even 44% of people from ethnic minority backgrounds agree that BLM has had a negative impact.

A whopping 70% of conservatives agree that the movement has stoked racial disharmony:

55% of all British adults and 44% of ethnic minorities think that Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests inflamed racial tensions pic.twitter.com/oHwygx3WIj — Matt Goodwin (@GoodwinMJ) November 28, 2020

Commenting on the findings, the director of the Centre for Research in Race and Education based at the University of Birmingham, Professor Kalwant Bhopal told The Guardian that it shows white people “feel their privilege is being threatened and questioned”.

This is a bizarre comment to make, given that a sizeable portion of non-white people agree with the sentiment that BLM has worsened race relations.

“When they see something like BLM they do what they can to protect it [their white privilege] and there is a backlash,” Bhopal added, displaying severe cognitive dissonance.

Major scientists in the medical and pharmaceutical community are coming out now in denial of the hoax, and Alex Jones is here to listen to them.

The British government is, once again, out of step with the public on this issue, given that at the height of a national lockdown it allowed BLM protests to go ahead unimpeded, and even consented to statues of historical figures, including Winston Churchill, as well as war memorials being covered by boxes at the best of the BLM mob.

The findings in the UK mirror the backlash for BLM in the US, where opinion shifted massively against the movement after repeated violent clashes with police, mass looting and rioting resulted from many BLM gatherings.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

78,78,"Gavin Newsom Threatens ‘Drastic Actions,’ Including Stay-at-Home Order",['Joel B. Pollak'],"California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday that “drastic actions” such as a new stay-at-home order might be necessary to slow the spread of coronavirus in the state.

Newsom said that the state had reached a “tipping point,” and that with the continued increase in hospitalizations due to the disease, the state could run out of hospital beds by Christmas.

This is the tipping point. CA has worked hard to prepare for a surge—but we can’t sustain the record high cases we’re seeing. Current projections show CA will run out of current ICU beds before Christmas Eve. Please stay safe & stay home as much as you can for next few weeks. pic.twitter.com/5NJYzHokhE — Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) November 30, 2020

The Los Angeles Times reported:

Of particular concern is the state’s intensive care capacity. Currently, about 75% of the state’s 7,733 ICU beds are occupied — with 1,812 of them filled by coronavirus patients. Unless things change, the state could exhaust its existing ICU capacity by mid-December, according to projections Newsom presented. “If these trends continue, we’re going to have to take much more dramatic — arguably drastic — actions,” he said during a briefing. Those include “the potential for a stay-at-home order” for areas in the strictest purple tier of California’s coronavirus reopening road map, he said. Of the state’s 58 counties, 51 are in the purple tier.

The state’s “purple tier” counties are already under a month-long, 10 p.m.-to-5 a.m. curfew.

State and local officials are particularly worried about coronavirus spikes over the holidays. In Los Angeles County, officials have prohibited outdoor dining at restaurants and imposed new restrictions on business capacity.

In more positive news, Newsom tweeted that California will receive 327,000 doses of Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine by mid-December.

There’s a perfect opportunity to avail yourself of some of the ship’s range of five-star facilities this morning – maybe a little gentle exercise in the fitness room before heading up to the sun deck to enjoy a coffee whilst chatting with newly-made friends as our ship makes a graceful arrival in Porto once more, passing under the city’s spectacular bridges. Porto is of course synonymous with wonderful port wine and all the famous port producers are here, such as Cálem, Sandeman and Ferreira, so a visit here would not be complete without a tour of one of them. You’ll learn about this fortified wine’s fascinating history and its close British connections. Port is made from grapes still pressed in the traditional way – by feet – then lovingly matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you’ll get the chance to sample various port styles at the end of our visit. After lunch on board we enjoy a guided tour of Porto. Strategically overlooking the Douro as it empties into the Atlantic, Portugal’s second largest city was originally a Roman town, but its wealth derived from its knowledge of the sea routes to India, with fortunes made from trading spices, silks and other fine goods. Our tour unveils some of its major and more surprising sights. You’ll have the rest of the afternoon to explore the truly fascinating city; so perhaps return to the terraced streets of the old town and wander the sloping maze of winding, cobbled alleyways, soaking up the atmosphere whilst stopping to admire the lovely architecture, soaring bell towers, fine baroque churches, golden rooftops and beautiful tiles of this slice of traditional Portugal. Stop for a drink in a cosy café and be tempted by an array of delicious cakes and pastries – perhaps sample a pastel de nata, the traditional Portuguese custard tart. This evening, enjoy a final dinner on board expertly served by our restaurant staff under the supervision of the maître d’. Afterwards, perhaps settle into the lounge to chat into the evening and reflect on the splendours of the remarkable River Douro – over a glass of port, of course.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

432,432,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed “ill-judged criticism” from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been “convicted of racism”.

Porto’s move came after City drew 0-0 at the Estádio do Dragão in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as “an opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism”.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: “His tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.”

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto’s coach Sergio Conceição accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Conceição described Silva as “childish” for a tweet that followed City’s victory in which the midfielder wrote: “This one felt so good!”

Porto’s newsletter claimed Guardiola had a “bad disposition after the meeting” on Tuesday and quoted Conceição as saying: “I would also be upset if I couldn’t win with the team he has and the budget he has.”

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: “Despite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn’t buy class or notion.” In response a City spokesperson said: “This is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

“In 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.”

The incident referred to came at the Dragão in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City’s XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: “Strange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn’t going to work. Clearly selective memory, I’m sure them receiving a fine for targeting Mario in 2012 just a memory.”

Did President Trump suggest that the much-hyped “second wave” of COVID-19 is actually a hoax?

A critic of Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak (D) pointed out on Twitter a picture circulated by the media showing a healthcare worker in a parking garage taking a selfie in front of a row of folded up beds wrapped in plastic.

“Here is the fake Nevada parking garage hospital picture that our moron governor tweeted, proving it’s all a scam. No patients, folded up beds, wrapped up equipment that’s never been used! They spent millions on this scam and never seen a single patient in this fake hospital!” NetworkinVegas.com said.

Sisolak had retweeted the photo on Monday thanking the first responders.

I am thankful every day for the doctors, nurses and other first responders in the State who continue to work selflessly on behalf of all of us. https://t.co/TNsjlxEx0l — Governor Sisolak (@GovSisolak) November 30, 2020

The man in the selfie, Dr. Jacob Keeperman, claimed he was at the COVID-19 Intensive Care Unit at Renown Medical Center in Reno where he had witnessed 5 deaths “in the last 32 hours.”

Another doctor told local media that they put more beds in the parking garage in case they hit capacity.

“If we continue to have an uptick of COVID-19 patients, we’re going to run out of hospital beds and people to take care of sick people,” said Dr. Deborah Kuhls.

A local ABC affiliate report covering this second wave “surge” shows dozens of empty hospital beds seemingly ready for more patients.

This comes as a University of Pittsburgh Medical Center whistleblower revealed to Infowars that the Covid “second wave” surge is largely a hoax to drive the public into submitting into another lockdown.

Remember, the medical vessels Comfort and Mercy were deployed to New York City and Los Angeles in March – the height of the pandemic – to assist supposedly “overwhelmed” hospitals.

But after several weeks, Comfort left New York City after treating 182 patients, 70% of whom had COVID-19.

Mercy departed Los Angeles after treating 77 patients in less than two months.

And during the initial outbreak of the pandemic last spring, numerous videos recorded by concerned citizens showed several reportedly “overrun” hospitals were actually practically empty!

Cameron said that the governor has “repeatedly” infringed on “the First Amendment free exercise of religion here in the commonwealth of Kentucky.

And so, when you tell folks who send their kids to religious-affiliated schools, which is an act of worship within itself, that they cannot go to school, it infringes upon the First Amendment rights.”

He added, “We won at the federal district court, who said that there was — it was appropriate to issue a statewide injunction because he’d infringed upon First Amendment rights. A panel at the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed and stayed that injunction. And so, now we’re ready to send our case to the Supreme Court.

835,835,The Guardian view on Poland’s Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government’s refusal to sign off on the European Union’s Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial “rule of law” clause, Archbishop Jędraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a “neo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God’s kingdom”. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender “ideology” in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jędraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October’s controversial abortion ruling by Poland’s constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops’ conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS’s leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, called on Poles to “defend the church at any price”. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church’s authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II’s judgment was criticised in last month’s Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope’s secretary, Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church’s steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczyński, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orbán’s Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to “abandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance”. Their statement denounced attempts to “exploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party”. If the country’s ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

67,67,David Mamet Calls Out ‘Experts’ and Questions Lockdowns: ‘The Virus Here Is Government’,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called “experts” and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

“The virus here is government—or at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,” Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence—and they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ — WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

“We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.”

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. “One is ‘permitted’ to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?”

David Mamet compares today’s coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. “Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,” he added. “The news media, backed by those parts of the ‘scientific community’ the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.”

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

“A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.”

698,698,"Six in a row: winning numbers in South African lottery are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10",[],"An unusual sequence of numbers drawn by South Africa’s national lottery has left players dumbfounded and sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot.

The consecutive numbers 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and a “PowerBall” number of 10 were the South African national lottery’s winning combination on Tuesday night.

Twenty lucky players hit the jackpot and won 5.7 million rand (£277,000) each. Another 79 won around 6,283 rand ($407) for guessing the sequence but missing the PowerBall.

“Congratulations to tonight’s 20 winners of PowerBall draw,” the lottery tweeted late on Tuesday. “These numbers may be unexpected but we see many players opt to play these sequences.”

Many perplexed South Africans used social media on Wednesday to allege the results has been fixed.

“Lotto exposing themselves that they are a scam,” posted one Twitter user. “20 people discussed this and shared that jackpot equally,” ventured another. “Absolutely no way in hell that’s a coincidence.”

Some even called for a judicial inquiry similar to the one looking into alleged corruption during ex-president Jacob Zuma’s nine-year tenure.

South Africa’s National Lotteries Commission (NLC), which regulates the game, said the six consecutive number combination was unprecedented and vowed to look into the draw.

NLC spokesman Ndivhuho Mafela told AFP the commission will conduct a review “and if there is anything that went wrong we will declare that”.

“So we are in the process of doing that currently.”

While it is not uncommon for two players to share the jackpot, multiple winners are extremely rare. The numbers are drawn live on TV.

In March 2003, 33 players won a share of the jackpot, according to a South African website that tallies results.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

700,700,Donald Trump suggests 2024 presidential bid: 'I'll see you in four years',[],"Donald Trump has floated the idea of running for president again in 2024 at a holiday reception at the White House on Tuesday evening.

“It’s been an amazing four years,” Trump told the crowd, which included many Republican National Committee members. “We’re trying to do another four years. Otherwise, I’ll see you in four years.”

Trump’s comments appeared to acknowledge that he thought he could have lost the election. While speculation about a presidential run in 2024 has been rife, and many US politics watchers expect him to declare a bid soon, he has not spoken publicly about it before.

The video was streamed live on Facebook by one attendee of the party, Pam Pollard, who is national committee member for the Oklahoma GOP. The footage showed dozens of people crammed into the Cross Hall of the White House state floor, standing closely together. Many seen in the video were not wearing masks. Coughing could be heard.

Trump at the White House Christmas party: ""It's been an amazing four years. We're trying to do another four years, otherwise I'll see you in four years.""

The Trumps began hosting holiday receptions this week, intent on celebrating a final season before Trump leaves office on 20 January. Trump has not formally conceded, but belatedly allowed the transition to Biden to proceed.

According to social media postings reviewed by The Associated Press, the White House Christmas events have featured large crowds of often maskless attendees gathered indoors – violating the very public health guidance the US government has pressed the nation to follow this holiday season as cases of Covid-19 skyrocketed across the country.

The White House has been the site of at least one suspected Covid-19 super-spreader event, and dozens of the president’s aides, campaign staffers and allies have tested positive in numerous outbreaks. Trump himself was hospitalized for the virus in October, and the first lady and two of his sons have tested positive. Numerous others have had to quarantine.

Stephanie Grisham, the first lady’s spokeswoman and chief of staff, had said last month that the White House would be moving forward with events, “while providing the safest environment possible.” She said that would include smaller guest lists, that “masks will be required and available, social distancing encouraged while on the White House grounds, and hand sanitizer stations throughout the State Floor.”

“Attending the parties will be a very personal choice,” she added.

The video of Trump discussing the 2024 election emerged as he threatened to veto the $740bn National Defense Authorization Act unless it included a measure eliminating a federal law protecting tech companies such as Facebook and Twitter.

“If the very dangerous & unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk,” Trump tweeted late on Tuesday.

Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act protects tech companies from liability over content posted by users, and has been under attack from Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have criticized internet platforms’ content moderation decisions and accused them of stifling conservative voices.

The sweeping NDAA sets policy for the Department of Defense. It has been passed for six decades, one of the few major pieces of legislation seen as a “must-pass” because it governs everything from pay raises for the troops to how many aircraft should be purchased or how best to compete with rivals like Russia and China.

Congressional aides expressed skepticism Trump would actually veto the legislation. Democrats won’t agree to repealing 230 because the 24-year-old law provides a vital protection to social media companies.

185,185,Sarah Fuller’s Halftime Speech Has Some Accusing Vanderbilt of a Publicity Stunt,['Lara Gwinn'],"Vanderbilt senior kicker Sarah Fuller made history on Saturday, becoming the first woman to play on the field in a Power 5 college football game, during the second-half kickoff against the Missouri Tigers. However, recent reports about what happened at halftime before her history-making kick have some believing that her presence on the field may have had more to do with publicity than football.

ESPN reporter Courtney Cronin tweeted on Sunday that she had just ended a Zoom interview with Fuller, where the history-making kicker detailed her halftime locker room speech. “I had coaches come up to me and say ‘I’ve been wanting to say that for awhile now,'” Fuller reportedly said:

I just got off a Zoom call with Vanderbilt kicker Sarah Fuller, who detailed the halftime speech she gave and the reception it received. ""I had coaches come up to me and say 'I’ve been wanting to say that for awhile now,'"" Fuller said. pic.twitter.com/AjoEEjJbeh — Courtney Cronin (@CourtneyRCronin) November 29, 2020

Fuller reportedly said to her new teammates:

If I’m going to be honest, I was a little pissed off at how quiet everybody was on the sideline. … We made a first down, and I was the only one cheering and I was like – what the heck? What’s going on? And I tried to get them pumped up, and I was like, ‘You guys need to start [cheering] your team on.’

My main thing was during the SEC tournament, my entire team was cheering the entire time. It didn’t matter if we were in the locker room or if they were on the sidelines, I think that’s what won it for us. Everybody was cheering non-stop. I just went in there, and I said exactly what I was thinking. I was like, ‘We need to be cheering each other on. This is how you win games. This is how you get better by calling each other out for stuff, and I’m going to call you guys out.’ We need to be supporting one another. If we get a first down, if an interception happens, it’s our fault. We need to be lifting each other up. That’s what a team’s about. I think this team has struggled, and that’s been part of it. We really just need to build that team camaraderie where they can all lean on one another. It was an adjustment going from that team mentality where – hey, we’re all here supporting one another, and I just wanted to bring that to this team.

Some took issue with Fuller’s locker room speech in particular. Joe Kinsey from Outkick questioned Fuller’s and Vanderbilt’s intent:

If you were on the fence about whether Vanderbilt using soccer goalie Sarah Fuller as a fill-in kicker for Saturday’s game against Missouri was a publicity stunt or a necessity, you got your answer on Sunday when it was announced that Fuller had given a halftime speech to her new teammates. Keep in mind, Fuller hadn’t yet stepped foot on the field for her kickoff before giving this speech. … As for this speech, you mean to tell me that a kicker who was pulled off the women’s soccer team and who started practicing with the football team on Tuesday was given the floor to lecture teammates on Saturday?”

“Do you think freshman players on the women’s soccer team who’ve never seen the field get up and give speeches to players who’ve given four years to a program? Nope. Not happening,” Kinsey said.

Responses to Cronin’s tweet also questioned the validity of Vanderbilt’s intentions, with one person saying, “I’m all for her kicking, but this is absurd. Imagine a male walk on kicker of any sort showing up 7 games into the season, not even kicking yet, then lecturing the team about not cheering hard enough bc that’s what they did on his soccer team.”

Another response read, “I mean man or woman, what gives a soccer player who’s been on the team 3 days the RIGHT to stand up and call out players. Imagine being a senior in this locker room. What gives her the authority to do this? Especially a kicker?? Nah.. this ain’t it.”

Others supported Fuller’s place on the team as a needed move for Vanderbilt. Radio host Pat McAfee said, “She was not out asking for this.. An opportunity presented itself,” and that it was not a publicity stunt:

Fuller had a response to her critics during a recent interview. When host Holly Rowe asked Fuller how she handles her critics, Fuller took it in stride, saying, “At this point, like, what are you doing? You know? I am a [Division 1] soccer player. I’m going to Vanderbilt University. I’m getting my degree from here. I’ve done amazing things,” she said:

Vanderbilt head coach Derek Mason said on Wednesday, “Right now, we’re just looking at all options. … For us, talking to Sarah, she’s a champ, and no pun intended. Just coming off an SEC Championship in soccer… She’s a complete competitor. She’s an option for us. Right now, that’s where we sit.

“For us, every week is [about] getting to the practice field and about making sure that we put the best possible kicker out there, so we’re competing,” Mason said.

It’s just common sense.

456,456,Godmothered review – Disney remixes Enchanted … minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones’s Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There’s the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles – swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

It’s impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney’s 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor’s career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland’s closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams’s Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there’s winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom – Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor’s preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor’s self-centered “helpfulness” feels earned. But Godmothered’s tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother’s overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there’s one – co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) – within reach), but its shoehorned revelation – that true loves comes in many forms – is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious – unrealistic in the parts where it’s trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor’s misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it’s a bumpy, underwhelming ride – not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
831,831,Dear President Trump: election officials are facing death threats on your watch | Gabriel Sterling,[],"On Tuesday, a Republican senior election official in Georgia, Gabriel Sterling, gave an emotional and scathing press conference in which he described death threats and abuse he and others affiliated with counting the presidential vote in Georgia have endured. Sterling called out Donald Trump and other Republicans for stoking conspiracy theories about the election and encouraging an atmosphere of intimidation against people trying to do their jobs.

Here is a transcript of his public remarks:

I’m going to do my best to keep it together because it all gone too far, all of it. Joe diGenova [an attorney for the Trump campaign] today asked for Chris Krebs, a patriot who ran [the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], to be shot. A twentysomething [voting technician] in Gwinnett county today has death threats and a noose put out saying he should be hung for treason because he was transferring a report on batches from a [voting machine] to a county computer so he could read it. It has to stop.

Mr President, you have not condemned these actions or this language. Senators, you have not condemned this language or these actions. This has to stop. We need you to step up, and if you’re going to take a position of leadership, show some.

Georgia Republican warns Trump is inciting violence over election: 'Someone will get hurt' Read more

My boss, [Georgia secretary of state Brad] Raffensperger, his address is out there. They have people doing caravans in front of their house. They’ve had people come on to their property. Tricia, his wife of 40 years, is getting sexualized threats through her cellphone. It has to stop.

This is elections. This is the backbone of democracy, and all of you who have not said a damn word are complicit in this. It’s too much. Yes, fight for every legal vote. Go through your due process. We encourage you. Use your first amendment. That’s fine.

Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it’s too much. It’s not right. They’ve lost the moral high ground to claim that it is.

I don’t have all the best words to do this because I’m angry. And the straw that broke the camel’s back today is, again, this 20-year-old contractor for a voting-system company just trying to do his job … in fact, I talked to Dominion [a voting system company] today, and they said he’s one of the better ones they’ve got. His family’s getting harassed now. There’s a noose out there with his name on it, and it’s just not right.

I’ve got police protection outside my house. Fine. You know, I took a higher-profile job. I get it. Secretary ran for office. His wife knew that too. This kid took a job. He just took a job. It’s just wrong. I can’t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now over this. And every American, every Georgian, Republican and Democrat alike, should have that same level of anger.

Mr President, it looks like you likely lost the state of Georgia. We’re investigating, there’s always a possibility, I get it. You have the rights to go to the courts. What you don’t have the ability to do – and you need to step up and say this – is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. Someone is going to get hurt, someone is going to get shot, someone is going to get killed, and it’s not right. It’s not right … all of this is wrong.

DiGenova, who said for Chris Krebs to get shot, is a former US attorney. He knows better. The people around the president know better. Mr President, as the secretary said yesterday, people aren’t giving you the best advice of what’s actually going on on the ground. It’s time to look forward. If you want to run for re-election in four years, fine – do it. But everything we’re seeing right now, there’s not a path. Be the bigger man here, and step in. Tell your supporters: “Don’t be violent. Don’t intimidate.” All that’s wrong. It’s un-American.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

636,636,Witness K lawyer Bernard Collaery wins international free speech prize,[],"The Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery has won a prestigious British free speech prize for his efforts exposing a secret Australian operation to bug Timor-Leste’s fledgling government during sensitive oil and gas negotiations.

Collaery is still being pursued by the Australian government through the criminal courts and, if convicted, the barrister and former ACT attorney general faces jail for allegedly sharing protected intelligence information.

The charge stems from an episode during which Collaery, who frequently acted for intelligence officers, represented an Australian spy known as Witness K, who had grown increasingly concerned about a 2004 mission to bug the government offices of Timor-Leste during commercial negotiations with Australia, an ally, to carve up the resource-rich Timor Sea.

The actions of Witness K and Collaery helped Timor-Leste, one of the world’s poorest nations, take a case to the international courts and, eventually, renegotiate a fairer deal.

Now, Collaery has been recognised with the International Blueprint for Free Speech Whistleblowing prize, which recognises the bravery and integrity of whistleblowers who have made a positive impact in the public interest. Previous winners of Blueprint for Free Speech awards include Chelsea Manning, who won while behind bars in 2016 at a maximum security prison in Kansas, and Nick Martin, the doctor who blew the whistle on Australia’s treatment of asylum seekers on Nauru.

Collaery will share £12,000 in prize money with another winner, Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds Banking Group employee who revealed a failure to act on evidence of fraud.

Collaery told the Guardian he was honoured to win the prize.

“I’m honoured and privileged and I’m going to dedicate the award to funding a granddaughter of mine through years 11 and 12,” he said.

“The rule of law, I learned from my years in Cambridge, has been more securely protected there than it is in Australia, and I’m deeply grateful that the award has come from Britain, a country my father died, as an Australian, protecting.”

One of the judges, Lady Hollick, an award-winning former investigative television journalist, described Collaery’s story as “extraordinary”.

She said it showed the dangers posed to those who told the truth about the Timor-Leste scandal.

“It’s a story of spies, international espionage and corporate greed,” she said. “One of the richest countries in the Asia Pacific spied on and betrayed one of the poorest.

“Today the tiny nation of Timor-Leste has finally achieved a better outcome. Australia has been forced to give it a fairer proportion of the oil and gas revenues.

“However, those who have told the truth about the case are still in a dangerous situation due to retaliation.

“Bernard Collaery’s story highlights that those under threat no longer include only whistleblowers and the journalists who work with them in the public interest. Increasingly, whistleblowers’ lawyers are now being targeted.”

Collaery and Witness K’s cases both remain before the courts in the Australian Capital Territory.

In October, the Law Council of Australia threw its support behind Collaery. It took particular umbrage at the secrecy surrounding his case, in part enforced through the national security information act, which is designed to govern the handling of sensitive and protected information by the courts.

The council warned that the laws were protecting “broadly defined national security at the expense of the rights of the accused”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

James’s contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year’s NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The contract extension, once it is made official, will guarantee James career earnings of $429m.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,39,The ships powered by 'green hydrogen',[],"But the real challenge for using it in long-distance shipping is how tricky it is to store. Hydrogen cannot simply replace bunkering fuel in the current system. To store it on board a ship as a liquid, it needs to be frozen using cryogenic temperatures of -253C (-423F), says Hubatova. And even then, it takes up a lot of space – around eight times more than the amount of marine gas oil needed to give the same amount of energy, according to EDF analysis.

The extra space needed by hydrogen has caused concern in the industry that it might need to clear out cargo to make room for the fuel. But an analysis from the ICCT has found that this barrier could be overcome. It found that 43% of current voyages between China and the United States – one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes – could be made using hydrogen without the need for cargo space or to stop more times to refuel. Nearly all the voyages could be powered by hydrogen with only minor changes to fuel capacity or operations, it found.

Ammonia alternative

Hydrogen is often used as a catch-all term for synthetic fuels, but many experts believe another option is actually better: using the green hydrogen to make green ammonia, another fuel which can be either combusted or used in a fuel cell. Ammonia is far easier to store than hydrogen (it needs refrigeration but not cryogenic temperatures), and takes up around half the space since it is far denser. It can also be converted back to hydrogen onboard a ship, meaning it could be loaded and stored on the ship as ammonia but ultimately used in a hydrogen fuel cell.

“At the moment, the best bet is to just turn [hydrogen] into ammonia, which is this ‘Goldilocks fuel’,” says Smith. “Ammonia is so much cheaper to store; you can store it at a pressurised tank, so you don't need to have any sort of cryogenics. It's only a small amount more expensive to make than hydrogen.”",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

220,220,Nikola shares fall after GM scraps Badger deal and drops equity stake,[],"(CNN) General Motors is giving up its equity stake in Nikola Motors and scrapping plans to build the electric truck maker's Badger pickup as part of a new, scaled-back deal between the companies.

Nikola shares plunged more than 20% on the news.

The new deal replaces an agreement announced in September in which GM had planned to take an 11% stake in Nikola and supply the startup with equipment for its highly anticipated hydrogen fuel cell trucksGM had also previously said it would build Nikola's planned pickup, the Badger.

But shortly after that deal was announced, a short seller released a report leveling allegations of fraud and exaggeration against the company and it's then-chairman Trevor Milton. Nikola disputed the report.

In the wake of the allegations, GM reminded investors that it had not yet closed the deal with Nikola. The new arrangement, announced Monday morning, is still just a memorandum of understanding, not a final deal. Under this deal, GM will simply be a supplier to Nikola.

Nikola executives have said the Badger pickup would be built only through an arrangement with an outside company. The company has now said it will refund deposits potential customers had placed for the truck.

""Nikola is focusing on its core business of producing commercial zero-emission trucks,"" a Nikola spokeswoman said in an email.

The two companies will also discuss Nikola possibly using GM's Ultium battery system, which will used in GM's future electric vehicles.

""This went from a game changer deal for Nikola to a good supply partnership but nothing to write home about,"" analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe at Wedbush Securities wrote.",CNN,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another day dawns and you rise refreshed as we continue our southerly course, firstly calling at Telašćica, one of the largest and most beautiful natural harbours in the Adriatic - largely uninhabited, this is a stunningly rugged stretch of coastline backed by sheer limestone cliffs that plummet into the sea, flanked by a scattering of pretty islets and islands, home to numerous plant and bird species such as rare peregrine falcons. During our stop here, you’ll have opportunity to wander to the shores of Lake Mir, a natural salt lake, with its warm, supposedly therapeutic water that channels through the limestone on its way out to sea. Later this morning, have your camera at the ready as we are soon entering the waters of the breathtaking Kornati archipelago; an explosion of numerous fascinating desert-like islands lie scattered around the central island of Kornat. George Bernard Shaw wrote that [God] ‘created the Kornati Islands out of tears, stars and breath' and there is certainly something ethereal about their distinctive barren beauty. In fact, this remarkable region was designated a National Park in 1980, in celebration of its extraordinarily unusual and desolate charm. The Kornati Islands hide a multitude of secret caves and grottoes amongst the rugged cliffs. Our Captain will drop anchor to allow a swim stop this morning, so enjoy a cooling dip before lunch again on board. Later we arrive at the little port of Šibenik, where our guided tour reveals more about the history of this delightful town as we wander its medieval streets, seeing the beautifully restored Renaissance town hall and remarkable Gothic cathedral, thought to be the world’s largest church built without brick or wood supports. This evening the MS Il Mare remains moored in Šibenik. Dinner is at leisure tonight so wander ashore and seek out some traditional Croatian fare: hearty fish stew or mouth-wateringly tender slow cooked beef, simmered with wine and prunes, with fresh crusty bread baked ‘under the lid’ – a typical Croatian style of cooking. Sit back and soak in the magical ambience of historic Šibenik.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

For many waking in Vienna on New Year's Day will be a highlight of the cruise. The city’s very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city was the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world’s finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and of course, a whole family of Strausses. In this capitvating city, there’s also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School and the Vienna Boys’ Choir. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire. There has also been a Yuletide market in Vienna since the Middle Ages and today the markets held over the festive period sell a huge range of seasonal gifts and mouth-watering treats. This morning we enjoy a tour in the company of a local guide who will offer insights into why Vienna is one of Europe’s great capitals, now proudly embellished in winter sparkle. There will also be time to browse the stalls of the markets where the irresistible smell of roasting chestnuts fills the air. Alternatively retreat to the refined yet cosy elegance of a traditional Viennese café for a steaming hot chocolate and a tempting pastry. After lunch on board we visit the magnificent Schönbrunn Palace. Once the summer residence of the Hapsburgs, this former royal residence now houses a range of world-class museums and galleries. Your included entrance and audio guide allows you into the dazzling state rooms, with their wealth of priceless artworks and the family’s impressive royal carriages.

699,699,Trump lawyer: ex-election security chief Krebs should be 'taken out and shot',[],"A former head of US election security who said Donald Trump’s defeat by Joe Biden was not subject to voter fraud should be “taken out at dawn and shot”, a Trump campaign lawyer said.

Condemnation of Joe DiGenova’s remark about Chris Krebs was swift, including calls for his disbarment and the charge that he was behaving like a “mob attorney”.

Krebs was fired as head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) on 17 November, not long after he said the election, contrary to Trump’s claims, “was the most secure in American history”.

Krebs also used Twitter to publicly debunk Trump’s conspiracy theories.

DiGenova defended the president in the Russia investigation and is now involved in attempts to overturn results in battleground states. The Trump campaign has won one lawsuit – and lost 39.

DiGenova made the remark about Krebs on The Howie Carr Show, a podcast shown on YouTube and the Trump-allied Newsmax TV, on Monday.

“Anybody who thinks the election went well,” he said, “like that idiot Krebs who used to be the head of cybersecurity, that guy is a class A moron. He should be drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot.”

Carr did not challenge the remark.

A day earlier, Krebs told CBS 60 Minutes Trump was trying to “undermine democracy … to undermine confidence in the election, to confuse people, to scare people”.

Trump called that interview “ridiculous, one-sided [and] an international joke”.

DiGenova is not the first close Trump aide to call for the death of an official in the president’s disfavour. In early November, former campaign chief and White House strategist Steve Bannon said FBI director Christopher Wray and public health expert Anthony Fauci should be beheaded. He was banned from Twitter.

DiGenova said Trump’s legal team was “talking to the jury, trying to influence the jury. And that includes judges and state legislatures. And the governors in these states are a bunch of losers, along with their secretaries of state. I’ve never seen such wimps wearing an R [being Republican].

“You know, they’re going to have to be dealt with politically. It’s the only way you deal with these people.”

Brad Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state in Georgia who has resisted attempts to overturn Biden’s win there, has said he and his wife have received death threats from Trump supporters.

Condemnation of DiGenova’s remark about Krebs was swift.

Louis Clark, chief executive of the Government Accountability Project, said in a statement: “Threats like these trigger an avalanche of them. They terrorise other whistleblowers into silence. It’s behavior befitting a mob attorney.”

Frank Figliuzzi, a former FBI deputy director, said DiGenova had made “a retaliatory threat involving Krebs’ official duties, in violation of federal law Title 18 USC 351”.

Andrew Weissmann, a former federal prosecutor and senior aide to special counsel Robert Mueller in the Russia investigation, tweeted that the remark was “shocking” and DiGenova should “face disbarment at least”.

Krebs, he said, had shown “fearless integrity”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
125,125,David Mamet Calls Out ‘Experts’ and Questions Lockdowns: ‘The Virus Here Is Government’,['David Ng'],"Acclaimed playwright David Mamet has added his distinctive voice to the growing chorus of dissenters who are questioning the effectiveness of government-mandated masks and lockdowns to combat the coronavirus.

In a recent op-ed for the Wall Street Journal, the Glengarry Glen Ross playwright slams the so-called “experts” and advisers whose counsel has led to the destruction of large swaths of the U.S. economy. These people will likely never pay the price for their errors, but everyone else will, he noted.

“The virus here is government—or at least the incompetents who advise our rulers and cannot admit the legitimacy of dissension. Absent intervention, this virus may eventually kill the host organism,” Mamet wrote.

Those closest to the boss will have the most influence—and they often keep it, even in failure, writes David Mamet https://t.co/i9OVqCbQvQ — WSJ Editorial Page (@WSJopinion) November 28, 2020

“We all have to trust others for their expertise, and we all make mistakes. The horror of a command economy is not that officials will make mistakes, but that those mistakes will never be acknowledged or corrected.”

The playwright noted that experts have issued contradictory messages about the effectiveness of masks, citing the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine that published an article saying masks are useless outside health-care facilities, only to issue a quasi-retraction.

He also cited the example of a friend who owns a restaurant and is going broke. “One is ‘permitted’ to sit at his tables and eat without a mask. Indeed, how would one eat while wearing one? Does the virus know that one is sitting down?”

David Mamet compares today’s coronavirus advisers to failed advisers of the past, citing the case of Prof. Frederick Lindemann, a confidant to Winston Churchill. During World War II, Lindemann downplayed the idea that the Germans were developing a rocket capable of bombing London, which became the V-2. He was wrong, but never paid a professional price for his mistake.

Mamet also cites Joseph Stalin’s science adviser, Trofim Lysenko, who came up with the idea of training crops to grow in winter. It was a disaster that contributed to mass starvation in communist Russia and China.

The playwright even brings up the debate around climate change. “Now we have climate change and its attendant alarmists,” he added. “The news media, backed by those parts of the ‘scientific community’ the media chose to honor, presented this analysis as though it were indisputable fact. In fact, it was riddled with problems.”

Today, millions of people face economic ruin as a result of the coronavirus and the policies crafted by experts who are advising the government, he wrote.

“A pandemic was allowed to destroy the American economy. Tens of millions are driven out of work, cover their faces, and walk down the streets in fear of their neighbors.”

961,961,'My coolness has disintegrated': how pop stars cope with fatherhood,[],"This summer, two of the world’s biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, “a lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?” Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.

In recent years, female artists such as Perry – but rarely their male counterparts – have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because “people wouldn’t find a mother as appealing”. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had “underestimated this whole mommy thing”.

Lily Allen, who has parodied the industry’s disgust at her post-baby body in her videos, wrote heart-wrenchingly about her work schedule from her children’s perspective on her last album (“You say you’re going but you don’t say how long for / You say it’s work, but I’m not sure”). Jessie Ware has said that leaving her 18-month-old at home while she toured the US “nearly tore me apart”, and felt her songs about motherhood alienated young crowds – leading her own mother to advise her to quit music entirely.

Artists opening up about these strains is progress, but at the same time, they are often defined in increasingly narrow terms – moving from the “female pop star” category to the even more restrictive “mum” box. When it comes to correcting the gender imbalance, one option remains: explore the realities of working fatherhood too.

“I hardly ever get asked about being a father,” says Thurston Moore, who had a daughter with his Sonic Youth bandmate and ex-wife Kim Gordon in 1994; Gordon, on the other hand, wrote in her memoir about the huge shift in the way interviewers approached her after becoming a mother. Since then, fatherhood seems to have become more of a talking point for male musicians. The rapper Ghetts, who wrote about his fears for his daughter’s future in his Ivor Novello-nominated single Black Rose, says people are very interested in his role as a dad, and McFly’s Tom Fletcher – whose family-man image has been cemented by the work of his wife, Happy Mum, Happy Baby podcaster and current I’m a Celebrity … contestant Giovanna Fletcher – says interviewers ask about his life at home with three young sons.

Yet the answers differ. Rather than fatherhood impeding their career progression, the male musicians I speak to say that having children only made the pursuit of success more important. Ghetts says that when he had his daughter eight years ago, he “wasn’t as financially secure as I am now, so I panicked. It was like, ‘Wow, I’m going to be responsible for another human being.’ So it threw me into being more busy, if anything.” Hot Chip’s Joe Goddard also cites his breadwinner role. Although his children “get upset when I am about to go away”, they “understand my job provides a good lifestyle for them where we have the things that we want”.

It’s not only their own family’s financial situation that musician fathers feel responsible for – their fortunes are often tied up with those of their bandmates. Everything Everything drummer Michael Spearman was back on the road three days after his daughter was born. “You don’t want to let anyone down by saying, ‘it would be great to do that festival, but we can’t because I can’t,’” he explains. Goddard says having children at the same time as Hot Chip vocalist Alexis Taylor made it easier to adapt their schedule. “I think if it was just one of us I would have felt much more uncomfortable because it’s our primary income, so it would be affecting everybody financially in the group to limit the amount that we tour.”

In the streaming age, gigging is an increasingly important component of any musician’s living (or it was, pre-pandemic). Juggling lucrative live shows with fatherly duties is a problem Ghetts solves by “speeding back during the night” after shows, and then “doing the school run in the morning”. Do his peers see that as normal? “No,” he laughs. “They think that’s mad!” Goddard and Spearman, meanwhile, both got replacements to cover them for international tours that overlapped with their wives’ respective due dates, but it wasn’t ideal. “If you’re in a band, people expect to see you on stage,” says Spearman.

Another solution is to bring your family with you. Paul and Linda McCartney famously took their children on the road throughout the 1970s. “I don’t think having the kids on tour was particularly stressful,” he later said. Fletcher – who had his first child “two weeks before I went on the biggest tour of my entire career” – was equally untroubled by the experience. “It actually worked out amazingly because my wife and my son came on the tour, we based ourselves in hotels, we had no disturbances, room service, it ended up being a peaceful way to experience those first months of having a newborn.”

Wayne Coyne of the Flaming Lips, who had his first child in June 2019, is similarly positive. “About 10 days after he was born, we played a festival in St Louis, which is about 10 hours away from where we live – we drove our family car with him,” he says. Subsequently, he, his wife and their son (and sometimes his wife’s mother) travelled “all around the world, we went to Australia and all around Europe”, an undertaking he describes as “pretty easy” and “not too hectic”.

In 1995, Sonic Youth went on the Lollapalooza tour (incidentally, fellow headliner Sinéad O’Connor dropped out after a few shows due to her pregnancy). Moore and Gordon took their daughter along with a series of nannies and turned the back of the tour bus into a nursery. Moore is clear that this was only possible because of Sonic Youth’s huge success during the decade: “We made the decision to have a child at a time when we knew we could have a support structure.” Any earlier “would have been ridiculous. I think we were smart enough to not procreate in the 1980s.” Fletcher’s experience was also ameliorated by a generous budget. “Everyone was there to give us everything we needed.”

Is it easier being a dad in pop than a mum? Certainly, none of the men I speak to reports facing any hostility from the music industry when adjusting their work to accommodate fatherhood. “The only person who would ever do that is a band’s manager and they might say, ‘It’s going to impact on our finances’ or whatever,” says Goddard. “You’d have to be a bit of a dick to bring that up as a problem.” The concessions required seem to be relatively modest: just that gigs be scheduled further in advance or limited in number. “Hot Chip still end up playing in the middle of the night at festivals across the world,” Goddard says. “The band has continued to run mostly in the way that it always did.” Fletcher says he finds juggling schedules “pretty challenging”, but Ghetts says he finds the flexibility a blessing: “I’ll start work very late and work through to the morning and have a nap in the day. The scheduling is pretty much freestyle but it works out”.

And while women are often beleaguered by the phenomenon of “mum guilt” – the concern that (practically all) their actions are having a detrimental effect on their children – men have the much milder husband guilt. “My worries stem from putting extra pressure on my wife,” says Spearman, with Goddard adding: “There’s an imbalance in how much adult personal free time we have – my wife has far less. I have a little bit of an ego, I like that adoration from the crowd. My partner really doesn’t have much of that in her life. The incessant looking after two small people is a far more difficult thing.”

There are so many more expectations, stresses and issues for women, those pressures only amplify as they get older Tom Fletcher

The artists acknowledge more widely and deeply rooted inequality, too. “I think it’s still seen as a bigger deal when a woman has a child,” says Goddard, who says that although his manager didn’t mind him taking paternity leave, “if a woman was needing to take off six months or a year, maybe that’s different.” Fletcher cites the existing pressures on young women in pop – “there are so many more expectations, stresses and issues, and I think those pressures probably only amplify as they get older” – as well as “the hormones, what happens to your body” that men don’t experience. Spearman brings up the way female musicians are viewed through the prism of motherhood even if they don’t have any children: “Men don’t really get those questions: ‘Are you going to settle down and have a child?’ Women must be asked about it all the time.” When I ask whether Coyne, who had his first child at the age of 58, was ever faced with that question, he highlights another disparity. “I would say even in my 30s, 40s and most of my 50s, ‘I probably will have some kids.’”

What about the impact of fatherhood on their artistry? Moore says he was determined that neither his nor Gordon’s work “was going to be interrupted”. Coyne agrees that having his time punctuated by parenting proves no detriment to his work. “It’s good to be focused, but it’s also good to get unfocused, and refocus. It’s not like you have to go to the mountaintop and realise all your creative ideas and then you come back down. The mountaintop is in the other room, just go there for a minute and come back.” Ghetts is the only musician who says fatherhood has had a negative impact – albeit only temporarily. “Having a daughter actually stunted my creativity, because I was always overthinking about everything – what my daughter would think in years to come.”

Little monsters of rock … Ozzy Osbourne with son Jack, 1985. Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty Images

Historically, having children has not seemed to impede a hellraising image: Ozzy Osbourne was a father of three when he bit the head off a bat. Nor does it dull revolutionary potential: David Bowie had his son Duncan in 1971, shortly before shattering pop into pieces. But while nobody I spoke to felt they had a decreased commercial value post-parenthood, there was less consensus regarding the effect on their persona. Fletcher says fatherhood “didn’t have an impact on the way we were going to present ourselves or the way we were perceived. We naturally are getting older and one of the beauties about being in a band is it keeps you feeling young.” Ghetts says “there’s a generation of rappers now who are in the limelight that [think] fatherhood’s cool, fatherhood’s sick”.

Goddard is more ambivalent. “My coolness factor has probably pretty much disintegrated. Maybe it should be more normal for people who are involved in rock and electronic bands to just be dads, decent family guys.” Spearman says Everything Everything didn’t want to mention fatherhood “too much” in the press release for their new album, “because it makes us look a bit old. And it’s a bit of cliche to be like, ‘We’ve written a record about having a kid,’ which is not what our record is about. We don’t want to overstate it.”

So the threat of being considered in more reductive terms is, it seems, also a possibility for men with children. That said, Spearman and co haven’t noticed any real-world implications yet. “We got playlisted on Radio 1,” he says happily. “Not bad for a dad band!”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pubs, bars, and restaurants in Wales will be banned from selling alcoholic drinks, and they will have to close by 6pm or switch to doing takeaway, according to the new set of rules unveiled for the hospitality industry.

Other entertainment venues, such as cinemas, bowling alleys, and skating rinks, will have to close outright.

The measures, announced by First Minister Mark Drakeford, will come into force from 6pm this Friday.

“I recognise just how hard the hospitality and leisure sectors have worked to comply with the regulations,” Drakeford said in a press conference, admitting the new rules’ harshness. “I know the new restrictions will be difficult, coming as they do at one of the busiest times of the year,” he added.

The 1996 world champion has empathy with the task Schumacher will be taking on when he joins the F1 grid with Haas in 2021. Hill’s father, Graham, won two world championships before he was killed in a plane crash in 1975 when Hill was 15. When he decided to race himself, his background was impossible to ignore, just as Schumacher’s F1 career will open in the looming shadow of his illustrious father, a burden he must face down.

“There is a sense that some people don’t want you to have a go,” says Hill. “I felt like some people felt: ‘Why is he doing this? He is never going to be as good as his dad.’ It does not necessarily follow that because your dad was a world champion that you will be any good, but that should not prevent you from a having a go. You should be able to have a go if you merit it, and F1 will find a way to see if you merit it.”

Hill persevered, racing for Williams and famously battling Schumacher for the title in 1994 and 1995 before securing it in 1996, becoming the first son of a world champion to win the championship. Jacques Villeneuve would go on to follow his father, Gilles, into F1, and also won a title, while Nico Rosberg won after following in the footsteps of his title-winning father, Keke. Having a distinguished background in the sport is more than just an inspiration, says Hill.

“I wanted to race, I loved racing, I loved competition and I loved the sport. But I also was determined to not let the side down with being a Hill. Some element of it when my dad died was, if you like, resurrecting or honouring the family name. So I very much took lessons from my dad’s life and career and applied them to my racing.

“Jacques was very different. He never even talked about his dad; as far as he was concerned he was going to stand alone as Jacques, not as the son of Gilles. In some ways it is a blessing and in some ways a curse.”

Schumacher, of course, has had to overcome his own trials beyond proving himself on track to get this far. He was just 14 when his father was injured in the skiing accident from which he has yet to recover. Understanding this loss as he went through his own at a similar age, Hill believes it has given Schumacher a greater sense of purpose.

“It really is tragic what happened to Michael,” he says. “Mick has experienced something in his life which has been very tough to bear, and I am sure it is a little bit of extra motivation that he will have.”

Schumacher has been in the spotlight since he began racing, particularly when he took to single seaters in 2014, and that level of scrutiny will intensify now. He not only carries the family name but also perhaps something no other driver has ever had to cope with, the intense interest in his father because of the accident he suffered. It is a weight he has borne well, says Hill.

“I have been very impressed with how diplomatic he has been, and how he has asked people to be respectful of the privacy the Schumacher family has asked for. I think he has coped with that admirably, and that has given him the chance to focus on what he wants to do. But he doesn’t strike me as someone who is interested in getting publicity for himself. He wants to race and he wants to win.”

Schumacher is entering a maelstrom. As a rookie he will face pressure like no other. His every move will be analysed on and off the track, and, as Hill noted, there will doubtless be observers waiting to pounce on his errors. Yet he has already shown remarkable maturity and composure thus far in his career, and Schumacher’s best answer is to maintain this and make his point on the track. There will be no shortage of earnest hope that he can do so.

“In a way it’s very simple – if you perform well, then all those problems melt away,” says Hill. “I will be keen to see how he gets on. Everyone has been massively affected and appreciates the pain that the Schumacher family have gone through. They wish Mick well, they really do.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
825,825,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan’s Princess Mako – the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne – and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom’s mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan’s royals; it has also brought the country’s succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro’s mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako’s father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

“I approve of them getting married,” he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. “The constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.”

But, he added, Komuro’s family needed to make a “visible” response to his mother’s financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: “From my point of view, I don’t think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]” – adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor’s daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively “ordinary” life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan’s succession laws, no female member of the imperial family – not even the emperor’s 19-year-old daughter, Aiko – can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako’s younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other “irreplaceable”, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as “someone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
955,955,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the “certain knowledge” that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that “the scientists have done it”, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with “over-optimism”, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

When and how will I be able to get a Covid vaccine in the UK? Read more

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: “We’re no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.”

He added: “We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.”

There were still “immense logistical challenges”, he said. “So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it’s all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we’re not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.”

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning’s press conference announcing the vaccine’s approval. “And what a momentous … journey and international effort it has been,” Van-Tam said. “Discovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.”

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. “If we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‘Oh, the vaccine’s here, let’s abandon caution,’ all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.”

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a “complex product” and “really tricky to handle”, explaining: “It’s not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.”

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was “going to eradicate coronavirus ever”, but we may get to the point where it becomes “a seasonal problem” like flu. He added: “Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party … and say, ‘That’s it, it’s behind us,’ like the end of the war? No, I don’t.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

The UK has purchased 40m doses of the Pfizer jab – enough for 20 million people, as it is administered with two injections 21 days apart.

723,723,Cutting UK overseas aid could harm the fight against future pandemics,[],"This year, we’ve seen how a previously unknown animal virus can spill over into the human population in one country, pass rapidly between people, and spread across the world in days. With nearly 1.5m reported deaths from Covid-19, the virus is a startling indication of how the health of the world’s human population is inseparable from animals and the environment that we share with them.

Treating health in a way that recognises these interdependencies is called the One Health approach. Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related. Zoonotic diseases that we catch from animals emerge most frequently in places where humans and animals interact closely, while the globalisation of trade and international travel, the intensification of agriculture and ecosystem destruction all contribute to the increased risk of animal pathogens infecting humans. Instead of leaving the job of protecting human health exclusively to medical experts, the One Health approach shares responsibility across veterinary, biological, environmental and social sciences.

We’ve worked as principal investigators on international One Health projects in parts of Asia and Africa for years, working with local scientists to research zoonotic diseases. Through one of our projects, working with scientists in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Vietnam, we study zoonotic diseases and antimicrobial resistance linked to poultry, such as avian flu, which remains a significant pandemic risk. Another project trains scientists in Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somaliland and Somalia in One Health research techniques, including into zoonotic and potentially pandemic diseases.

These programmes and many others like them are supported with funding from UK Aid. Some £1.5bn of the UK’s commitment to spending 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on overseas aid was used to create the Global Challenges Research Fund (GCRF), which has enabled UK scientists and researchers to develop networks and projects with scientists in low and middle-income countries across the world.

But at a time when this international approach is needed more than ever to protect us from future pandemics, it’s coming under threat from the government’s proposal to slash its aid budget by a third, from 0.7% to 0.5% of GNI. We don’t yet know where the axe will fall, but some researchers are worried that in the longer term, projects focused on building the capacity to deal with emerging pathogens in other countries could lose funding.

Not only has funding from UK Aid put UK science and innovation on the global map – it’s also been crucial in preventing the emergence of pandemics and funding treatments for them. The government has pledged £7.2m in UK funding for 20 new research projects to address the impact of Covid-19 on the world’s most vulnerable communities, and the GCRF, for example, invested £12.4m to help establish five UK-led global vaccine networks involving hundreds of academic organisations in Europe, North and South America, Asia and Africa. These networks support scientific collaborations and help build research capacity across the world. One of these, the International Veterinary Vaccinology Network, specifically targets vaccines for animal diseases, helping to protect food security and potentially reduce the risk of zoonotic disease spillover to people.

And since 2015 the government has committed £120m funding from the UK aid budget to support the manufacturing and delivery of vaccines for diseases that the UK Vaccine Network has classed as having the potential to cause pandemics. This work, undertaken largely in the UK, focuses on helping to develop vaccines for emerging diseases in low- and middle-income countries. As pandemics do not recognise borders, this work also helps protect UK health.

Take the Mers coronavirus for example. This virus, first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia, was one of the diseases on the UK Vaccine Network’s priority list. It causes severe respiratory disease and is transmitted to humans from infected dromedary camels. Funding for Mers vaccine development was awarded to the Oxford Jenner Institute, which had already reached an advanced stage in its research by the start of 2020, allowing the researcher teams to rapidly adapt their approach to develop the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine.

We’ve already experienced numerous recent disease outbreaks that originated in animals, from Sars to H5N1/H1N1 influenza, Mers, Ebola, Zika and now Covid-19. We can be confident that many more will follow. Alongside these sporadic emergencies, which rightly receive huge media attention, the world faces a more insidious and arguably even greater danger from the ongoing march of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

In the words just last week of the WHO director-general, “Antimicrobial resistance … threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and leave us defenceless against infections that today can be treated easily”. Like viral pandemics, the causes of AMR are complex, often originate in contexts where animals are in close contact, and are best addressed with an interconnected approach that considers factors such as water, sanitation and hygiene as well as the misuse of antibiotics to treat animal and human diseases. And like pandemics, the development of AMR in one part of the world threatens everyone.

The UK’s track record in funding international One Health projects, including vaccinology for human and animal diseases, has put it in a strong position to help end the current pandemic and prevent the next one from emerging. But the government’s decision to reduce its commitment to UK aid to 0.5% GNI, considerably less than the 2010 level of 0.57%, threatens to deplete future funding that makes these crucial projects possible.

The global Covid-19 pandemic could derail efforts to control and eradicate malaria across the Pacific, with the potential for thousands of new cases and deaths, health experts have warned.

Malaria, one of the oldest diseases on Earth, remains one of its most significant killers: the mosquito-borne disease still kills 400,000 people a year, most of those children under five.

Prof Brendan Crabb, chair of Pacific Friends of Global Health and chief executive of the Burnet Institute, said the Pacific was at acute risk if intervention measures were disrupted within health systems overwhelmed by, or focused on, Covid-19.



There are a number of infectious diseases that could spike if we ignore them in the wake of the focus on Covid-19, but none are more acute than the short-term risk that malaria poses. It can double, even triple or worse in a single season if the wheels come off control measures.

In Papua New Guinea, where malaria remains highly endemic, case numbers surged between 2001 and 2016 – from 80,000 to 500,000 every year – when control measures weakened.

A recent Lancet study said disruptions to malaria interventions could lead to 46m additional cases worldwide.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan’s parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan’s soldiers reached the settlement’s outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

“We expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,” Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. “Nobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,” Safaryan says.

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

“When we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,” Hajiyeva says. “Even after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‘We’ll be back soon.’ It never happened.”

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a “war generation”: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

“I was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,” she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. “Geographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,” she says. “The feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.”

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. “Armenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,” Safaryan says. “We had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn’t trustful coexistence.”

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. “I asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,” she says. “Later we learned it was about unification with Armenia.”

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. “We said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,” Hajiyeva says. “We even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.”

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. “Slowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,” she says.

“One day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,” Hajiyeva recalls. “After that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.”

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. “I opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,” she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family’s home. “My parents just woke up and realised war had begun.”

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. “Some days they couldn’t even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,” Safaryan says. “They were very bad, very harsh days.”

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan’s favour.

“The whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,” she claims. “They left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.”

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh’s Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan’s parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. “They are just existing,” she says. “We are trying to figure out what we are going to do.”

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. “Some people were saying, why have you left your city?” she recalls. “They were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.”

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. “The house has survived the occupation,” he says. “I have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what’s happening in my city.”

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. “My friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,” he says. “But I’ve always prepared myself that once I’ll be back in Shusha, I’ll start my new life from zero.”

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. “I cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,” Hajizada said. “It is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.”

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. “I feel like I’m nobody now,” Safaryan says.

387,387,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc’s chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as “derisory” by Downing Street.

On the “level playing field” provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

“Barnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‘What’s the rush?’” said one senior EU diplomat. “Ambassadors for every country bordering the UK – 11 all in all – raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.”

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. “The EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,” a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe’s coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

A source said: “Fish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.”

David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament’s Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year.

He tweeted: “We are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

“Swift progress is of the essence. An agreement needs to be reached within very few days if council and parliament are to complete their respective procedures before the end of the transition period. Democratic scrutiny is not negotiable.”

145,145,London: Pop Star Rita Ora Hit with Fines for Lavish Birthday Party,['Ben Kew'],"British pop star Rita Ora has admitted to a “serious error of judgement” after she was busted for hosting a lavish 30th birthday party for herself at her restaurant in London.

According to the Daily Mail, the “Hot Right Now” singer invited at least seven friends to the bash at the Casa Cruz restaurant in Notting Hill where they partied “until the early hours” of Sunday morning.

After being alerted to the possible infringement of Britain’s nationwide lockdown measures, the London Metropolitan Police attempted to gain access to the venue at around 9pm on Saturday evening, but with no success.

However, officers continued their investigation into whether an event was taking place, and reportedly slapped Ora with a £10,000 fine for her flouting of the lockdown rules. Ora has since acknowledged her mistake, describing it as a “serious and inexcusable error of judgement.”

“Hello all, I attended a small gathering with some friends to celebrate my 30th birthday,” she posted on her Instagram story as reports began to hit the media. “It was a spur of the moment decision made with the misguided view that we were coming out of lockdown and this would be OK. I’m deeply sorry for breaking the rules and in turn understand that this puts people at risk.”

“This was a serious and inexcusable error of judgement,” she added. “Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I take full responsibility.”

A source close to Ora told the Mail: “Rita knows her actions were wrong which is why she has voluntarily paid the £10,000 ($13,367 USD) fine to the council. She hopes this will go some way to making up for her error of judgement.”

Ora’s ignoring of the rules follows countless reports of celebrities and public officials urging the public to abide by lockdown measures imposed as a response to the Chinese coronavirus before being caught violating the rules themselves.

Earlier this month, the cast and crew of the upcoming Matrix 4 film reportedly skirted Germany’s ban on parties and large social gatherings by throwing a party scene within the movie.

According to the newspaper Dild, the some 200 actors and production crew attending the bash at the Studio Babelsberg in Potsdam, Berlin, enjoyed everything from a DJ and pyrotechnics to tattoo stations and food caravans handing out sushi and fancy desserts.

In August, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo allowed musicians and celebrities to skirt the state’s mandatory 14-day quarantine rules so that they could perform at the MTV Video Music Awards.

38,38,The psychology behind ‘revenge bedtime procrastination’,[],"The sleep ‘Catch-22’

Although people might resent work squeezing their leisure time, reducing sleep is probably not the best ‘retaliation’. Sleep deprivation, especially long term, can lead to a host of harmful effects, both mental and physical. In Matthew Walker’s book Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams, the neuroscientist is blunt: “The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.” And people, in general, know this: everybody interviewed for this article felt their sleep patterns were unhealthy – but they still kept late nights.

Psychology may explain the reason why people would choose to eke out this leisure time even at the expense of sleep. A growing body of evidence points to the importance of time away from work pressure; failure to detach can lead to stress, reduced wellbeing and burnout. “One of the most important parts of recovery from work is sleep. However, sleep is affected by how well we detach,” says Sheffield University’s Kelly. It’s important, she explains, to have downtime when we can be mentally distanced from work, which would explain why people are willing to sacrifice sleep for post-work leisure.

“People are stuck in a Catch-22 when they don’t have time to detach from their work before they go to sleep, it is likely to negatively affect their sleep,” says Kelly. The real solution, she suggests, is to ensure that individuals are allowed time to engage in activities that provide this detachment. However, this is often not something employees can achieve by themselves.

Heejung Chung, a labour sociologist at the University of Kent and an advocate for greater workplace flexibility, sees the practice of delaying sleep as the fault of employers. Tackling the problem would benefit workers but also help ensure a “healthy, efficient workplace”, she points out. “It’s actually a productivity measure,” she says. “You need that time to unwind. Workers need something to do other than work. It’s risky behaviour to do only one thing.”

Greater flexibility

Since the pandemic, companies in many nations have implemented work-from-home policies, introducing greater flexibility into working lives but also, in some cases, further blurring already tenuous boundaries between work and home. It’s not yet clear how this might affect the kind of work culture that leaves employees shunning sleep to claw back some free time.

Chung says that genuine change requires an institutional shift, across many companies. “It’s difficult for individuals to react [to their work situation],” she says. But she does advise employees to talk to their colleagues and collectively approach their boss, with evidence, if they want to ask for change.

However, this might not be forthcoming in China. In fact, reports suggest that companies are digging in even more when it comes to overtime as they try to bounce back from losses caused by Covid-19. Krista Pederson, a consultant who works with multinationals and Chinese corporations from Beijing, says that she’s observed this trend. Chinese companies see their working culture as an advantage over markets like the US or Europe where people tend to work fewer hours: “They know they have hard workers who are ruthless and will do whatever it takes to get ahead, including working all the time,” she says.

With such a demanding work culture, employees will keep on tackling the problem in a way that works for them. Despite burning the candle at both ends, Gu Bing loves her job and embraces her stolen leisure time. “Sometimes, I really reckon night time is perfect, beautiful even,” she says. “My friends and I, we converse at night and sometimes we write songs together. It’s quiet and peaceful.”

And there is the option, for the lucky ones, of changing jobs, which is what Emma Rao did, finally swapping her 996 job for a slightly less demanding one. However, Rao has found that old habits are hard to shake. “It is a revenge,” she says of her late bedtimes. “To get back some time for yourself.”",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

871,871,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace – review,[],"Queen’s Gallery, London There’s an entire wall of Rembrandts in here, not to mention magnificent works by Vermeer and Rubens. But these treasures should be on show to everyone all the time

Some of the greatest paintings in Britain – and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens – all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don’t – because, obviously, they weren’t allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen’s pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art – and this collection – to HM using the term “early modern”. This old school art snob would no more have said “early modern” than he’d have said “taken to Twitter”. He’d have said “renaissance” or “baroque”.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen’s Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection’s finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I’ve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt’s rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam’s Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar’s anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he’s studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They’re consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Consciously posing … Rembrandt’s Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I’ll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It’s hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here’s the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He’d recently lost his wife. A friend – thought to be William, Lord Crofts – is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck’s mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer’s surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they’re in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It’s either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens’s personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There’s a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show – she painted it for Charles I – and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection’s virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I’m grateful that some of the royal family’s treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It’s hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

731,731,The Fiver | Fans are back! But avoid using toilets during peak times,[],"THE RETURN OF PROPER FOOTBALL

If nothing else, the last few months have proved conclusively that the old adage “football without fans is nothing” is bull, tish, pish, balls, balderdash, piffle, waffle, yap and mummery. True, football without fans is not very good. But imagine what the last nine Covid-infused months would have been like without any football at all. The Fiver can only speak for itself, but we’d either be in prison, a gutter or rehab. Or on the run. Or maybe we’d have used the time spent watching the likes of Leicester v Fulham at 5pm on a weekday to learn a new language, or get round to reading Finnegans Wake, or whatever it is you haven’t done either. Leicester v Fulham is better, though, isn’t it?

But now fans are back! This evening, at 7pm, Brunton Park will welcome the first supporters to an English professional game in a non-trial event since the sport was suspended on 13 March. Carlisle United have sold all 2,000 tickets on offer for their League Two match against Salford, the first step on a long road back to some sort of normality. Fans have to arrive early, wear face masks, observe social distancing, not touch the ball if it comes near them, not approach players, and avoid “unnecessary movement”. They’ve also been advised to avoid using toilets during peak times such as half-time and full-time, although now we come to think about it, that might have already been covered with the unnecessary movement clause.

They can also cane booze like there’s no tomorrow, without having to purchase a “substantial meal”, and are of course permitted to sing as long and loud as they like, either in support of their team, or to advise Michael Gove where he can store his scotch eggs. Luton, Wycombe, Charlton, Shrewsbury and Cambridge also welcome fans to their stadium a little later this evening, while Arsenal will become the first top-flight club to fling open their gates again on Thursday night, for the Big Vase fixture against Rapid Vienna. Given Arsenal’s poor form, the willingness of their support to offer trenchant in-game critiques, and how clearly and crisply we’ll be able to hear all these observations with such a small crowd in, expect the TV commentary to be one long rolling 90-minute apology for bad language. The Fiver is very much looking forward to it.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Alex Jones breaks down the bombshell admission by a hospital executive that the so-called “second wave” of the China Virus is a total hoax, much like the rest of the pandemic hysteria.

The whistleblower from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, which operates a network of 35 hospitals in western Pennsylvania, described how the latest “surge” of Covid cases was overblown by the media.

During this period, he said, hospitalizations increased from 96 beds to 600 beds, where the patients were kept in observation overnight and no deaths resulted.

However, the media will report that there was a 600% increase in hospitalizations to make it seem more dire and to justify another lockdown.

For example, if you start with 5 patients to 25, the media will say there was a 500% increase in cases — sounds terrifying, right?

But the reality is, no deaths resulted from 600 hospitalized patients, so another lockdown would be unnecessary and not worth the economic devastation.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

101,101,Georgia’s Fulton County Recount Delayed After Dominion Server Crash,['Hannah Bleau'],"The recount requested by President Trump’s campaign in Georgia’s Fulton County experienced a delay after a Dominion Voting Systems mobile server crashed on Sunday, according to Fulton County officials.

“Technicians from Dominion have been dispatched to resolve the issue,” Fulton County officials said in a statement after the server crashed on Sunday. “The Georgia Secretary of State’s office has also been alerted to the issue and is aware of efforts to resolve the problem.”

Dominion has remained at the center of claims of error and fraud in the 2020 election. While Sidney Powell is not formally part of President Trump’s legal team, she participated in a joint press conference with his campaign prior to Thanksgiving and detailed the purported issues with the voting machines.

As Breitbart News detailed:

Powell argued that U.S. votes were being counted overseas, and that Dominion voting machines and Smartmatic software were controlled by foreign interests, manipulating algorithms to change the results. Powell noted specifically that Smartmatic’s owners included two Venezuelan nationals, whom she alleged had ties to the regime of Hugo Chavez and Nicolas Maduro. The legal team alleged that there were statistical anomalies, such as huge batches of votes for Biden, that could not be explained except as manipulation — which, they alleged, happened in the wee hours of the morning as vote-counting had stalled. (The companies have disputed these allegations vigorously.)

Powell filed lawsuits challenging the election results in Georgia and Michigan last week, which contained the allegations she previewed at the press conference.

“Mathematical and statistical anomalies rising to the level of impossibilities, as shown by affidavits of multiple witnesses, documentation, and expert testimony evince this scheme across the state of Georgia,” Powell alleged, adding that “especially egregious conduct arose in Forsyth, Paulding, Cherokee, Hall, and Barrow County.”

Researchers have also questioned the reliability of the voting systems, noting that they “register votes in bar codes that the human eye cannot decipher” which could give voters “printouts that accurately spell out the names of the candidates they picked, but, because of a hack, the bar codes do not reflect those choices.”

In October, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) warned that Georgia’s newly implemented Dominion voting system was vulnerable to cyberattacks. It also noted that Texas rejected the Dominion equipment due to “multiple hardware issues.”

Top Democrats, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (MA), Amy Klobuchar (MN), and Ron Wyden (OR) also signaled concern over Dominion’s technology in 2019. In a letter to the private equity firms controlling the top U.S. election technology companies, the senators expressed concern over “vulnerabilities and a lack of transparency in the election technology industry and the poor condition of voting machines and other election technology equipment.”

However, Dominion has fervently denied what it called “false assertions about vote switching and software issues” with their voting systems, and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) has dismissed Powell’s accusations.

Fulton and the remaining 158 counties have until December 2 to complete the requested recount.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

This grand home dates back to the 15th-century and boasts fantastic views over the Menai Strait to Snowdonia. Enjoy a stroll around the gardens and grounds as you learn more about the history of the house before the tour continues to the captivating seaside town of Beaumaris, at the eastern end of the Menai Strait. Beaumaris’ UNESCO-listed castle dates back to the 13th century, when Edward I ordered its construction as part of his campaign to conquer Wales. However, construction of the castle was abandoned in the early 14th century when resources were diverted toward the invasion of Scotland. The unfinished castle was then occupied by the Welsh, and taken back by the English, and then reoccupied by forces loyal to Charles I during the English Civil War. Today, the castle remains as it was then: an unfinished masterpiece of near complete symmetry. The tour manager will bring the castle’s fascinating history to life, regaling you with tales stretching back the best part of a thousand years. Enjoy some free time for lunch in the town (payable locally) before continuing across the Menai Suspension Bridge to Caernarfon, on the Welsh mainland. The UNESCO-listed Caernarfon castle was also built as part of Edward I’s efforts to conquer Wales. Recognised as one of the great fortified buildings of the Middle Ages, the impressive Caernarfon castle took 47 years to complete, at a cost of £25,000 and contained an entire town! Your tour manager will give a talk outside the castle, and there will be time for those who wish to enter to do so (entrance payable locally).

Professor Elizabeth Pearce received an outpouring of praise and support after her message to her students went viral.

According to a report by Good Morning America, Professor Elizabeth Pearce of the University of Iowa went viral this week after she offered Thanksgiving meals to students that will spend the holiday on campus due to the pandemic.

In the email, Pearce said that she wanted to offer a home-cooked family dinner to students that had chosen to stay on campus over the holiday weekend.

Good morning. I know this has been a difficult time for a lot of you — some of you have had Covid, some of you are currently in quarantine, and some of you may not be able to go home for Thanksgiving as you have family members who are socially distancing. I don’t want anyone to feel alone at Thanksgiving, or to miss out on a homecooked family dinner, so I want to invite you to share my Thanksgiving dinner.

466,466,I tried hacking my life with Instagram gadgets. Did it work?,[],"If, like me, you’ve been involuntarily participating in this wild ride people are calling “the pandemic”, you may have experienced the same embarrassing urge as I have. Which is to fill the wide, empty void in your life with things: gadgets, gizmos, subscriptions, speakers, a little brush for your facial hair. Buying stuff online is, simply put, something to do.

Thanks to mass online data harvesting, this new pandemic habit has already been widely monetized. It’s most noticeable on Instagram, where with every few scrolls we are hit with ads for products promising to change our lives, taking advantage of the fact that wherever you may be on the sliding scale of privilege, “life” is undeniably shit right now.

As lockdown continues, I’ve been targeted with ads for “face yoga”, a vibrating posture corrector, an app to improve my relationship, an app for intermittent fasting, and facial scrubs for my arse. Their promises are nothing but bold. But do they actually work?

To find out, I put a selection of products to the test.

The Jawzrsize – $25

Who doesn’t want a chiseled jawline? The Jawzrsize promises just that. All you have to do is pop it in your mouth and start masticating, doing three sets of 25 to 30 “reps” a day for 30 days. The beginners’ version will set you back $25, while the full transformation kit costs $100, and gives you four different chew balls.

The Jawzrsize has an unintentionally comic, and frankly sordid, air about it. In adverts, Jawzrsizers stand around with it stuffed in their mouths like gags, munching up and down, often while stretching or lifting weights. Watching someone do it can feel like you’ve accidentally walked into the wrong room at a Berlin sex club.

The way the Jawzrsize is marketed is often very masculine and intense, and fits into a growing trend among young men, especially incels, to resemble a “Chad” – a hyper-masculine man with pronounced, chiseled features and muscular build.

After using the Jawzrsize on a regular basis,my jaw started to ache. I would also occasionally gag. But as someone whose jaw is often tense and stiff due to clenching, it did offer some stress relief. So while I may not have a jaw as chiseled as someone with disturbing body image issues, I still occasionally pop it in when life gets a bit too much. And maybe after a while this stress-chewing of the Jawzrsize will make me resemble a real man; only time will tell.

Somnifix – $20

I was tapping through my Instagram stories one day when a woman suddenly appeared on my screen, her eyes shut and mouth covered with a sticky strip.

Had she fallen asleep while being kidnapped? Should I call the police? No – she was actually just reaping the benefits of Somnifix, a strip which goes over your mouth before you go to bed and stops you breathing out of your mouth to give you a better night’s sleep.

At first I didn’t want to try the strips, as I generally like to be able to breathe out of my mouth, whether I’m asleep or awake. But it turns out they have little breathing holes so you don’t suffocate if your nose becomes blocked.

I was excited to see if they worked, but almost every time I woke up in the morning my mouth was wide open, the strip lost somewhere between my sheets. It just couldn’t stay on. I tried shaving and had some success, but never managed to get it to stick, beard or not.

This isn’t to say such strips can’t be useful when they stay on. James Nestor, who wrote a book called Breath: A New Science of a Lost Art, says it can be hugely helpful in beating snoring, sleep apnea and hypopnea.

But Nestor also recommends a cheaper solution to Somnifix. In August, he told CNN: “I’m a big fan of American entrepreneurialism, but I don’t think you need a special tape to tape your mouth with.” Instead, he advises people to use the hypoallergenic micropore tape sold at drug stores, taking a small strip and using just enough over your lips to keep your jaw closed.

Back stretcher ($34) and neck hammock ($50)

Marketing contraptions that promise to make your neck and back feel better would have been a simple enough sell before the pandemic. But now that everyone is hunched over their makeshift desks at home, it’s no surprise to see ads for these products all over your feed.

The back stretcher device is great if you like to crack it now and again. But it’s probably best to talk to an expert if you experience serious back problems. Photograph: Max Benwell

The neck hammock and the spine-stretching arch both promise to do two similar things. One alleviates tension in your neck, the other in your back. Both feel good – the spine stretcher is great for anyone who regularly relies on someone to crack their back for them.

Meanwhile, the neck hammock hangs on your door and, once you’ve popped your head inside of it, it straightens out your spine, literally taking a weight off your shoulders (yes, that would be your head), and relieving tension.

These two products are the ones that give me the most immediate enjoyment. But as I was lying on my apartment floor, stretching my spine and hammocking my neck, I began to wonder: is this actually safe ?

I call David Casper, a spine specialist in Philadelphia. Part of me assumes that buying random orthopedic products off the internet and entrusting them with my spine may be risky, but David paints a more nuanced, reassuring picture.

“My first thing with addressing systematic back pain is always physical therapy, core strengthening, spinal muscle strengthening and kinetic chain exercises,” he says. “But when it comes to different types of products, I recommend to patients that if they know someone who tried it and had good success, so long as it’s not too expensive, it’s very reasonable to try.”

So can they work? “In terms of its actual efficacy it’s hard to say,” David says. “Really, the staples of resolving neck and back pain is building up your surrounding musculature.” However, if it makes you feel better, he says that it’s “worth a shot”.

Upright Go 2 – $100

If you ever find yourself hunching over your laptop like I do, you’ve probably felt the same spike in blood pressure when a straight-backed friend or colleague tells you how you should be sitting. They’re right, of course, but it’s also one of the most annoying pieces of advice you can receive.

The Upright Go 2 cuts out the need for any of this irritating human interaction, and automates the experience by correcting your posture. Once you’ve stuck the little plastic bluetooth device to your back and calibrate it on your phone, it buzzes every time you slouch for a certain amount of time. I set it to vibrate after 15s, but you can also do 30s or a minute.

You can’t roll your eyes at a robot, so throughout the day you find yourself straightening your back as it gently buzzes once your spine hits a certain angle. It helped me while I sat at my desk, and out of all the devices I tested I’d recommend it the most.

Manly app – $2.99 a month for full version

This may be the weirdest, stupidest, and most appropriate thing a man can get for himself eight months into the pandemic – especially if you’re single, insecure and thinking about sexting despite the last eight months enacting grievous bodily harm on your self-esteem.

It’s simple: you upload your topless photo. Then, using Manly’s suite of editing tools, you make yourself absolutely ripped, pinching, trimming and distorting your body to make it more toned, while adding fake muscles to make it look like it’s been stuffed full of sausages.

Some screenshots of Manly app adverts from Instagram. Photograph: Manly, Photable

One of the funniest things about Manly is its adverts. In most of them, they’ve so clearly hired very muscular models, then done the complete opposite of what the app does, and edited out their muscles . What this does is make the effects they add look “real” because they are. Meanwhile the “before” photo, which purports to be real, is clearly fake.

Personally, I’m quite enjoying my extra body fat as we approach the cold depths of winter. But if you were happier with the body you had before, you can use the app to pretend you’re one of those intolerable people who ended up working out more after finding themselves stuck indoors.

With the Manly app everything is fake, but also possible. You can give yourself big biceps, abs, pecs. You can even make yourself taller or add tattoos.

The only hitch is that, like me, you may end up looking absolutely bizarre – like a mix between Twitter chief Jack Dorsey and a man who will fight you if you come within a two-mile radius of his girlfriend.

My verdict on Manly is that we could probably do with fewer apps that try to exploit people’s body insecurities, especially given the trying circumstances we’re all facing at the moment. But at the same time, my mantra throughout the pandemic has always been the same. Whether it’s editing a fake six-pack on to my dad bod, staring into space for three hours, or making a needlessly elaborate meal for six people and eating it alone: it’s something to do.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
230,230,"Another 709,000 Americans filed for unemployment claims last week",[],"New York (CNN Business) America's jobs recovery is slowing down. While many have been able to return to work, millions remain unemployed.

Another 709,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits last week on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Labor Department reported Thursday. It was a slightly smaller number of initial claims than economists had expected.

On top of that, another 298,154 workers filed for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program sanctioned under the CARES Act to provide benefits to those ineligible for regular state aid, such as the self-employed.

Together, first-time claims stood at 1 million last week, not adjusted for seasonal fluctuations. That was a new low for the total number.

Still, it's been eight months since the pandemic crisis started, and the economic hardship created by mass layoffs remains for millions.

712,712,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it’s been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK’s first female prime minister?

It’s a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council’s controversial decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: “We find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.”

He added: “She was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country’s has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.”

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

“It’s been a long hard road. There’s been a few knocks and bumps along the way,” Schonhut said. “It’s nice to see things finally coming to fruition.”

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini Brexit,” she said. She hopes it’ll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . “In the area we’re living in we’re seeing a huge number of homeless people, we’re seeing food banks springing up all over the place.”

Burgess added that given Thatcher’s controversial legacy it was a “poorly judged decision” to push ahead with the statue. “There’s got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.”

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. “It’s a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

“I appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it’s a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.”

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. “The first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.”

He added: “I think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
759,759,Godmothered review – Disney remixes Enchanted … minus the charm,[],"Godmothered, a Disney+ live-action refocus on the understudied role of the fairy godmother, has the foundations of movie magic working in its favor. The first would be timing: just in time for the holiday season, the film, directed by Sharon Maguire (best known for Bridget Jones’s Diary), proffers fresh Disney princess canon at the tail end of an abysmal year, with audiences primed for cheerful, nuclear family escapism. There’s the comedic bona fides of its two leads, Isla Fisher and Jillian Bell, and a winning, suitably modernized premise: a well-meaning yet naively bumbling godmother on a mission to revitalize a harried single mother in present-day Boston, a fairytale trope isolated and reforged for pre-pandemic but still decidedly uninspired times. But where Godmothered should coast, it stumbles – swerving between unwieldy earnestness to something edgier and settling on something duller than it should be.

Superintelligence review – Melissa McCarthy can't save unfunny AI comedy Read more

It’s impossible to talk about Godmothered without comparing it to Enchanted, Disney’s 2007 revisionist fairytale which also plopped a naive, wide-eyed storybook character into a big east coast city, forced to convince a cynical population of the merit of happily ever after and conscript a bevy of urban creatures (for Enchanted, rats and pigeons; in Godmothered, a raccoon named Gary) into Snow White-style sidekicks.

Where Enchanted had a textbook fairytale princess exquisitely grounded by Amy Adams, Godmothered has Eleanor (Bell), the youngest godmother-in-training in the Motherland, appropriately nestled in some mountains a portal and spell away. Despite a lifetime prepping to sprinkle felicity on the lives of young, yearning girls, Eleanor’s career prospects have dimmed; demand for fairy godmothers has plunged in modern America (fair), as has the belief in happily ever after (also fair). Impatient to get on with the makeover and Prince Charmings, put off by the ennui of her classmates and rigid instructor Moira (Jane Curtin), and alarmed at the prospect of the Motherland’s closure, Eleanor impetuously throws a Hail Mary by responding to the letter of a 10-year-old girl outside Boston.

The twist: said girl, Mackenzie (Isla Fisher), is now a thirtysomething local news producer and harried single mother of two daughters who is reasonably skeptical of happy endings after the death of her husband. Eleanor, like Adams’s Giselle before her, plops into our world and the upended lives of her caretakers with all-consuming naivety and the subtlety of a hurricane. In both, the skeptics are won over by her undaunted enthusiasm, though the journey in Godmothered includes far more tonal hiccups and fewer musical numbers.

Not to bring it up again but, as evidenced by Enchanted or other latter-day animated Disney princess films such as Tangled and Frozen, there’s winning potential in subverting an age-old formula while also reminding us of its crystalline sweetness. Godmothered allows some of these buds to bloom – Fisher is strong as a multidimensional single mother, stressed at home and reeling from loss while burnt out at work. The influence of Eleanor’s preternatural optimism on the kids generates warmth, and a moment of comeuppance for Eleanor’s self-centered “helpfulness” feels earned. But Godmothered’s tender moments are overshadowed by its relentless zeal. Bell, a comedian more known for her profane humor than wide-eyed earnestness, gives Eleanor a winsome pluck, but the godmother’s overbearing naivety is applied so thickly that she struggles underneath its weight; the more Eleanor exerts inexhaustible cheer, the more cheerlessly annoying the alien-on-earth shtick becomes.

The resolution, thankfully, does not find Mackenzie swooning in the arms of prince charming (although, this being a Disney movie, there’s one – co-worker and fellow single parent Hugh (Santiago Cabrera) – within reach), but its shoehorned revelation – that true loves comes in many forms – is truth that lands with a clank. The collision of the real world and fantasy can feel snappy, alchemic, the same formula here is fractious – unrealistic in the parts where it’s trying to glom on to pre-pandemic America (Eleanor attending a Bruins tailgate in a ballgown and no one says anything, spells which allegedly set social media aflame but do not actually draw attention to the pair) and at times too determined to plant the story firmly in the non-Motherland (a particularly jarring line from Eleanor about homeless men around a fire offering her needles). Like one of Eleanor’s misfiring spells, Godmothered zings from undiluted sweetness to an attempt at edge and back, landing at an undesirable, uninspiring middle.

Which might not ultimately matter much. Kids are likely to enjoy this movie either way, as it retains enough of the Disney formula: a happy ending, the triumph of love, endearing-enough CGI wildlife, a climactic and heroic musical number as Jane overcomes her stage fright in the most duckling-to-princess style possible in Christmastime Boston. For everyone else, it’s a bumpy, underwhelming ride – not deviant enough to be offensive, but too tonally inconsistent to sustain sparks.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

'We expected to go back in days': Karabakh truce means exile for some, homecoming for others

'We expected to go back in days': Karabakh truce means exile for some, homecoming for others

Weeks of shelling could not force Irina Safaryan’s parents from their bunker in the southern Karabakh town of Hadrut. Only when Azerbaijan’s soldiers reached the settlement’s outskirts did the Armenian family agree to run.

“We expected to go back to our houses in three or four days, maximum a week,” Safaryan says. They left behind the family photo albums.

Fighting over the breakaway south Caucasus territory ended this month with Hadrut under Azeri control. “Nobody expected they were leaving their land, their house, for the last time,” Safaryan says.

Nagorno-Karabakh: Azerbaijan troops begin retaking land from Armenia Read more

The Armenian exodus mirrors another from three decades earlier, when 600,000 Azeris fled the first war between the post-Soviet republics over Karabakh, among them Hagigat Hajiyeva. She had also believed she was only temporarily leaving her home city of Shusha, less than 100km from Hadrut, when she fled in 1992.

“When we left Shusha we were thinking things would calm down and we would return,” Hajiyeva says. “Even after the Armenian occupation of the city, my family settled in [the Azerbaijan capital] Baku, but we still thought, ‘We’ll be back soon.’ It never happened.”

The Azeri victory over Armenia in the six-week war over Karabakh has turned tens of thousands of Armenian residents into refugees. For an earlier wave of Azeri exiles from Karabakh, the capture of the territory signals the end of a long wait to go home.

Safaryan, 28, says she was part of a “war generation”: both she and her sister were born in the underground bunker where her mother spent much of the 1988-1994 conflict over the mountainous territory. By the time it was over, most of the Azeri population had been forced out of Karabakh, and the Armenian victory over the area they call Artsakh was woven into the stories she heard as a child.

“I was always watching movies, documentaries, reading books about the war and the liberation of Artsakh,” she says.

Azerbaijan had sworn it would one day retake Karabakh, but Safaryan grew up feeling shielded by the mountains and tales of Armenian valour. “Geographically, Hadrut is very well protected and it was nearly impossible to take,” she says. “The feeling of being protected never left me. Even during this latest war, I was 100% sure our soldiers would do anything to win.”

The 1990s war over Karabakh was an escalation of nationalist sentiments that had been kept in check by decades of Soviet control. “Armenians and Azeris had been living together but there was no trust,” Safaryan says. “We had neighbours, maybe we had friends, but it wasn’t trustful coexistence.”

Speaking from her home in Baku, Hajiyeva, 72, remembers Armenians in the region holding protests as the USSR started to teeter. “I asked my Armenian neighbour what they were protesting for, and she said they wanted more theatres and cinemas,” she says. “Later we learned it was about unification with Armenia.”

By the late 1980s, violence was escalating, and the Armenian population of Shusha were ordered to leave. “We said goodbye to our Armenian neighbours in good spirits,” Hajiyeva says. “We even drove beside them as an escort out of the city.”

She assumed tensions would eventually die down, the way they usually did during the Soviet era. “Slowly, month-by-month, people started using guns and after some months, rocket systems,” she says.

“One day the Armenians fired a shell at the cinema outside our house and it was destroyed,” Hajiyeva recalls. “After that we decided to leave. It was too dangerous to live there.”

On the morning of 27 September this year, Safaryan woke to the sound of explosions near her home in Stepanakert, where she worked for the regional government. “I opened my window and saw the whole city was under shelling,” she says.

The first strikes on Hadrut were on military sites near her family’s home. “My parents just woke up and realised war had begun.”

Her parents spent the next weeks in the same bunker where the girls were born. “Some days they couldn’t even go outside to see the sun or breathe fresh air,” Safaryan says. “They were very bad, very harsh days.”

They were evacuated from Hadrut in the middle of October, two days before the town was overrun by Azeri soldiers. A buildup in military spending fuelled by oil wealth, including on Turkish and Israeli drone technology, helped to decisively turn the conflict in Azerbaijan’s favour.

“The whole street where we grew up and played, it was burned by Azeris,” she claims. “They left nothing from my childhood. People who came from there told us they burned everything.”

Several boys she had grown up playing with were among the more than 1,170 soldiers that Karabakh’s Armenian government says have been killed.

Safaryan’s parents are now staying with her grandparents in Yerevan. “They are just existing,” she says. “We are trying to figure out what we are going to do.”

After 1994, the plight of the Azeris who were displaced from Karabakh in the first war became a national cause in Azerbaijan, but the sense of being adrift never faded, Hajiyeva says. “Some people were saying, why have you left your city?” she recalls. “They were kind of blaming us. We felt ourselves insulted, humiliated, shy that we had been forced to leave our city.”

Her grandson, Suleyman, 25, was born after the family fled, but grew up hearing stories of their life in Shusha. He has tracked the fate of the family home using satellite maps and videos from the city posted online. “The house has survived the occupation,” he says. “I have always followed some Armenians from Shusha on social media to see what’s happening in my city.”

The reality of moving to the city may be more complicated than he imagined. “My friends, my work, everything in my life is in Baku,” he says. “But I’ve always prepared myself that once I’ll be back in Shusha, I’ll start my new life from zero.”

Hajiyeva says that after so many years she lost faith she would ever return. “I cried for hours when I heard that Shusha was liberated,” Hajizada said. “It is impossible to explain the feeling in words. We will kiss the soil there.”

Across the border in Armenia, refugees such as Safaryan have started their own long wait to go home. “I feel like I’m nobody now,” Safaryan says.

“Everything I was living and fighting for – making plans for big projects in Hadrut and every village and city in Artsakh – and now there’s nothing. Nothing to fight for, and nothing to live for.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

967,967,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever “our” is and whenever that “day” might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: “Oh God, we’re doing anarchism at the moment – it’s so boring.” How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism’s central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there’s a T-shirt slogan there, I’m sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father’s wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. “Of course she wasn’t,” my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening’s source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter’s adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

“How are you doing, Ryan?”

“Living the dream,” he said happily. “Living the dream.”

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself “to the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active”. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a “misconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There’s definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we’ve got a few Thatcherites in our class.”

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren’t born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? “Well, it’s everything, isn’t it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.” Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this £17,000-a-year establishment, she said: “There were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I’ve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.” No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: “I feel awful.” There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama’s inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that’s quite a start. “Things have deteriorated quite significantly since then,” he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: “It’s brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it’s never like that.”

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can’t bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of “real” politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it “interesting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.”

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view – or those of your tribe – and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics.

1055,1055,Psychic Already Sick Of Spectral James Randi Ragging On Her From Afterlife,[],"MIAMI—Struggling to mentally close herself off from the recently deceased skeptic, local psychic Rosemary Shanley confirmed Thursday she was already sick of James Randi’s specter haunting her place of business and ragging on her from the afterlife. “I’m sitting here with my crystal ball trying to see into the future, and it’s hard enough without the ghost of James Randi hovering in front of me and whispering that I’m a fraud and a huckster,” said Shanley, adding that she tried to banish the spirit of the famed debunker and stage magician by sprinkling holy water throughout the room, but the Amazing Randi just scoffed and called the ritual “easily disproved theatrics.” “What’s worse is that he’s taken to appearing before my clients and showing them how he can do everything I can do using nothing more than simple trickery. I was impressed when he first showed up and appeared to roll a pencil across my desk using only his mind, but then he insisted it was basic misdirection and called me a dumbass for believing in psychic powers. That dude needs to get off my case and go heckle some other clairvoyant.” At press time, sources from the beyond confirmed Randi had taken possession of Shanley’s body and was attempting to locate Uri Geller.

498,498,History of the Guardian and the Observer,[],"The Manchester Guardian was founded by cotton merchant John Edward Taylor in the wake of the Peterloo massacre of 1819. The first edition appeared on 5 May 1821. Taylor’s nephew CP Scott went on to become editor in 1872 and bought the paper in 1907. His 57 year editorship cemented the paper’s liberal values and gave it an international reputation. In 1919 it began publishing a special edition for readers abroad in the form of the Guardian Weekly.

CP Scott’s son John Russell Scott was determined to protect this legacy when, after the deaths of his father and brother, he became the paper’s owner. He established the Scott Trust in 1936 to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity. The newspaper continued to flourish under the Trust and, in 1959, changed its masthead to simply The Guardian, to reflect the breadth of its readership and coverage. The editor’s office and major editorial departments then moved to London in 1964.

The Guardian’s London years have seen fast-paced change in the world of the UK press. In 1993 the Guardian Media Group acquired the Observer, the world’s oldest Sunday newspaper, as a sister paper for the Guardian. Two years later the Guardian introduced its first website and in 1999 the series of sites that followed were pulled together to form Guardian Unlimited, predecessor to today’s theguardian.com.

643,643,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace – review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain – and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens – all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don’t – because, obviously, they weren’t allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen’s pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art – and this collection – to HM using the term “early modern”. This old school art snob would no more have said “early modern” than he’d have said “taken to Twitter”. He’d have said “renaissance” or “baroque”.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen’s Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection’s finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I’ve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt’s rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam’s Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar’s anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he’s studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They’re consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing … Rembrandt’s Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I’ll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It’s hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here’s the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He’d recently lost his wife. A friend – thought to be William, Lord Crofts – is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck’s mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer’s surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they’re in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It’s either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens’s personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There’s a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show – she painted it for Charles I – and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection’s virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I’m grateful that some of the royal family’s treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It’s hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

741,741,"'If the EU says we can’t open, they should pay': Italian ski resort awaits Covid ruling",[],"Paolo Di Bendinoni’s grandmother Adelina began the family’s ski hire business in the winter of 1964, when she kept a few pairs of wooden skis and boots in her home that she would rent out to tourists as they got off the bus by the square in the alpine village of Sestriere.

In the early days her trade came only at weekends, when a smattering of visitors would travel up from the nearby city of Turin. But as the village became more popular for skiing over the ensuing decades, the business flourished.

Di Bendinoni has worked for Noleggio sci Nonna Adelina since he was 18, and now runs it with his wife. All of his cousins are ski instructors. The family is emblematic of the village of 929 inhabitants, whose livelihoods depend on the ski industry.

That the season, which would ordinarily begin next week, is under threat this year owing to coronavirus restrictions is causing much anxiety.

“I have never not known a ski season,” said Di Bendinoni. “Even the years when there was little snow, we always had business. We work four months a year, seven days a week. The village basically survives on those few months of total activity.”

Sestriere and other ski resorts across Italy are on standby as European leaders try to reach an agreement over whether or not to ban ski holidays over Christmas and NewYear period. The Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, along with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, are in favour of shutting down winter sports until 10 January to limit the spread of Covid-19, while the Austrian and Swiss governments are against it. Austria’s finance minister, Gernot Blümel, said that if the EU really wanted to close a sector that would cost his economy €2bn (£1.8bn), then it should foot the bill.

“In Italy we’re in limbo, when you don’t know what will happen from one day to the next,” said Fiorenzo Gallice, Di Bendinoni’s cousin and a ski instructor. “The way I see it, we should respond in exactly the same way as the Austrians – if the EU says we can’t open, then they should pay for it.”

Sestriere sits at an altitude of just over 2,000 metres and forms part of Via Lattea, Italy’s third largest ski area, which comprises the towns of Claviere, Sauze d’Oulx and Pragelato as well as the French resort of Montgenèvre.

When the ski season is underway, the population in Siestriere often swells to 20,000 a day, many coming from Britain, with the busiest period being Christmas and New Year.

Italian ski resorts, which between them bring in about €11bn in revenues a year, were already dealt a blow after having to abruptly close in March when the first wave of the pandemic took hold. Gallice said Sestriere’s inhabitants and businesses received a pittance in financial support.

“Some got €600, others €1,200,” he added. “We’re in a really tragic situation. I really hope that I don’t discover that friends have killed themselves because they couldn’t carry on. We’re at that level and politicians need to understand.”

Gianni Poncet, the village’s mayor, said that ski resorts would end up like ghost towns if the season was cancelled.

With 217 miles (350km) of slopes in Sestriere, Poncet said skiers could easily socially distance. He pointed to the summer, when the mountains were busy with hikers but did not cause a spread of infections.

“We’re doing everything to make sure that at least some of the ski lifts can open,” Poncet said. “That’s the only solution we can foresee, and to do it securely. If you think about who works on the ski lifts or teaches skiing, or in the bars and restaurants – across the whole of the Piedmont region, if this machine doesn’t begin we will lose €1bn.”

Antonio De Luca, the owner of Bar QB, which serves breakfast and lunch and is a popular après-ski spot, said: “There is a lot of pessimism even as we continue to hope that things will be resolved, or that we can at least salvage what can be salvaged of the season.”

Whatever the EU decides, it is difficult to ignore that the continent is in still in the middle of a severe second wave of the pandemic. Italy registered 29,001 new infections on Thursday and 822 Covid-related fatalities, bringing the country’s total number of coronavirus deaths to 52,850. As hospitals remain overwhelmed, Conte urged Italians not to ski during the Christmas holidays. Italy reopened slopes in October only to close them after images emerged of packed ski lifts.

But the president of Sestriere Spa, which manages 56 ski lifts across Val Lattea, said he was certain people could ski in safety if things were done well, and that the company, which has 350 full-time staff, had come up with a plan whereby the number of ski lifts that open would depend on what the travel restrictions were.

“Even if people from abroad can’t come, we could open 20 ski lifts that could serve people coming from Lombardy, Tuscany and Liguria,” Giovanni Brasso said. “In the event of interregional travel being banned, we would open only 10 lifts.”

He said police could be brought in to ensure rules are maintained and crowding is avoided: “We’re at over 2,000 metres high and people who come already have glasses, hats, gloves … and with masks too, I believe the mountains are one of the least risky places.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iran announced that Fakhrizadeh was assassinated in Damavand Friday afternoon. Images of the scene show two vehicles, one with extensive fire damage and the other riddled with bullet holes. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif appeared to blame Israel for the nuclear expert’s killing.

“This was a criminal act & highly reckless. It risks lethal retaliation & a new round of regional conflict,” Brennan wrote of Fakhrizadeh’s death. “Iranian leaders would be wise to wait for the return of responsible American leadership on the global stage & to resist the urge to respond against perceived culprits.”

91,91,Ted Cruz Hammers Alyssa Milano On Coronavirus Aid: ‘Every Senate Dem Voted to Block Relief’,['Warner Todd Huston'],"Sen. Ted Cruz (R, TX) called out leftist actress Alyssa Milano for her attack on Republican lawmakers blocking a recent coronavirus relief bill after she ignored months of Democrats blocking similar financial relief bills.

Alyssa Milano took to Twitter on Sunday to slap congressional Republicans for blocking a minimum wage hike and a coronavirus relief bill for working-class families. Milano posted her tweet as a reply to an earlier tweet by Sen. Cruz, in which he noted the statistics proving that the Democrats are now the party of the super-rich, coastal elites while the GOP has become the party of working class Americans.

This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down. — Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) November 29, 2020

The Charmed star questioned Cruz’ contention that the GOP is now the party of the working classes by noting that the GOP had blocked the coronavirus bill. “This is hilarious. Why is the GOP blocking covid relief from working class families if it’s the party of working class? Or blocking the bill to raise minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour. Sit down,” Milnao tweeted on Sunday.

It is not exactly clear what bills Milano was speaking about but it is possible she was referring to the latest $15 Minimum Wage increase that died in the Senate. And she could be referring to Senate leader Mitch McConnell’s decision back in October to ignore Democrat Chuck Schumer’s attempt to force the upper chamber to discuss a second $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill.

Schumer wanted to debate his relief bill when Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett was being confirmed. It would have restored the $600-per-week federal unemployment boost and would have sent another $1,200 stimulus check to Americans.

But Senator Cruz quickly pushed back. The Texas Senator noted that Milano conveniently ignored the many months that Nancy Pelosi in the House and Chuck Schumer in the Senate blocked the GOP’s $500 billion coronavirus aid bill.

“Alyssa, facts matter,” Cruz tweeted back to Milano. “Dems have TWICE filibustered $500Bn in emergency COVID relief. EVERY SINGLE Senate Dem voted to block relief—Pelosi refuses even to talk—bc they believe maximizing economic pain helped Biden & it helps Dems in GA. & they trust the press to cover for them.”

The FAA approved the fleet for a return to the airways in November following a 20-month hiatus that occurred after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

According to a report by View From The Wing, American Airlines is the first airline to announce that they will run test flights with Boeing’s 737 Max fleet to ensure their safety. The fleet was grounded by aviation authorities around the globe after two fatal crashes that occurred in 2018 and 2019.

American Airlines announced in a statement that it will be flying five 737 Max flights without commercial passengers prior to their official reintroduction into the airline’s aircraft inventory.

“We know that restoring our customers’ confidence in the 737 MAX starts with ensuring our own team members are comfortable,” the statement reads. “That’s why, leading up to the aircraft’s return to scheduled service Dec. 29, we’ll operate five 737 MAX flights, exclusively for team members.”

The flights are scheduled to take place between December 3 and December 17. The test flights will depart from Dallas, Miami, and New York City’s LaGuardia airport. Pilots will be required to participate in simulator training at facilities in Dallas and Miami. The training will reportedly simulate various scenarios, including the MCAS system failure that led to the two fatal crashes.

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using “snappy” slogans like “defund the police” that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

“You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done,” the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

Here's what interviewing voters taught me about the slogan 'defund the police' | Danny Barefoot Read more

“The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?” Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important “new blood” in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president’s interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats – including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed “defund the police” was not about mere words but a “demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country”.

“We didn’t lose Breonna because of a ‘slogan’,” said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge – ultimately unsuccessfully – the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s seat in the November election.

Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) We didn’t lose Breonna because of a slogan.



Instead of conceding this narrative, let’s shape our own. It’s time we listen to the people, organize and build coalitions around our own message, and cast a vision that inspires us all to lead for change at the ballot box and beyond. https://t.co/mBg7wanaR6

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that “Defund the Police” was “not a slogan. It’s a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.”

“With all due respect, Mr President – let’s talk about losing people,” she said. “We lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We’re losing our loved ones to police violence.”

The Black Lives Matter movement member’s rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police – a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health – factors that contribute to crime.

The former president’s comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden’s flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

“If you instead say ‘Let’s reform the police department so that everybody’s being treated fairly,’” Clyburn offered alternatively. “Not just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?’”

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

“Hospitalizations are climbing — statewide. What can you do? Cut out the small gatherings. Now. 65% of all cases are traced to small gatherings. Gov’t can’t enforce who’s in your living room. But you can,” he wrote.

As his state prepares to go into another lockdown that could put thousands out of work, Cuomo accepted his International Emmy Award last week by claiming victory and saying his press conferences offered “authentic truth and stability,” according to Breitbart News.

“In what became a Cuomo love-in for the so-called ‘Love Gov,’ a chorus of celebrities joined in to sing the governor’s praises,” the report continued:

Absent from the ceremony was any mention of Gov. Cuomo’s March directive ordering New York nursing homes to accept COVID-19 patients, which caused the virus to spread like wild fire among that state’s elderly and infirm population. His decision contributed to the state’s COVID-19 mortality rate, which currently ranks as the second highest in the nation.

963,963,Photography campaign shows the grim aftermath of logging in Canada's fragile forests,[],"When TJ Watt first stood at the base of a towering western red cedar on Canada’s Pacific coast, the ancient giant was surrounded by thick moss and ferns, and the sounds of a vibrant forest ecosystem.

When he returned a few months later, all that remained was a massive stump, set against a landscape that was unrecognizable. “To come back and see a place that was so magnificent and complex just completely and utterly destroyed is just gut-wrenching,” he said.

Watt’s photographs of the forest – and the grim aftermath of logging – are now the centrepiece of a campaign by the Ancient Forest Alliance to capture the impact of clearcutting old growth trees in British Columbia. Despite recent efforts by the province to protect these fragile forests, conservationists say far more is needed to prevent the collapse of ecosystems.

Watt has photographed clearcuts in the province for more than a decade with the AFA, but said the “graveyard of stumps” in the Caycuse watershed remains a jarring sight.

“We’re in the midst of a global climate environmental crisis yet here in Canada, a first world country, we’re allowing the destruction of some of the most highly endangered old growth forests on the planet,” he said. “A lot of people are shocked that that’s still happening here. It’s not illegal. The government sanctions it.”

The AFA estimates that most of the original old-growth forests along the province’s southern coast have been logged commercially. Less than 10% of Vancouver Island’s original old growth forests – where Watt shot his before-and-after series – are protected.

Conservation groups have fought for decades to protect some of the oldest trees in the country. Campaigners won a major victory in September, after the province of British Columbia agreed to implement 14 recommendations from the Old Growth Strategic Review over the next three years.

The panel called on the province to defer logging old-growth forests in nine areas throughout the province, protecting 352,739 hectares (871,600 acres) until a formal plan is developed. But as critics point out, only 3,800 hectares (9,400 acres) – or about 1% of the deferred areas – is previously unprotected old-growth forest.

“There’s a huge gap between the quality of the recommendations and initial steps the government took,” said Jens Wieting of the Sierra Club of BC, pointing out that deferral areas contain only 1% of the most at-risk ecosystems. “That means that 99% of the work still remains to be done.”

Both Watt and Wieting have called on the government to both protect the remaining old growth forests and to help forestry-dependent communities so they can transition away from old growth logging. They also say Indigenous peoples must have a role in protecting and managing the forest.

“I’m going to keep taking these ‘before’ photos,” said Watt. “And it’s up to politicians if there’s going to be an ‘after’ shot.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
148,148,"Celebrity-Backed Time’s Up Spent Big on Executive Salaries, Little on Victims of Sexual Harassment",['David Ng'],"Time’s Up, the anti-sexual harassment organization created by Hollywood celebrities in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, has spent big bucks on executive salaries but has skimped on helping actual victims, according to a new report.

The group raised an impressive $3,670,219 during its founding year of 2018, but spent $1,407,032 on salaries and just $312,001 on the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund for victims of sexual harassment, the New York Post reported, citing tax filings.

In addition, the group reportedly spent tens of thousands of dollars on advertising, and $940,328 on “legal” costs, with the bulk of that figure going to Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer, the multinational law firm.

Time’s Up boasts a slew of Hollywood celebrities and former Obama associates in leadership roles. The group’s governing board includes former Obama senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, mega TV producer Shonda Rhimes, CNN personality Ana Navarro, as well as actresses Eva Longoria and Ashley Judd.

Tina Tchen, who served as an assistant to former President Obama and chief of staff for Michelle Obama, is currently Time’s Up president and chief executive officer. She is also co-founder of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund.

The Time’s Up Foundation’s “global leadership board” includes a bevy of celebrities including Jessica Chastain, Brie Larson, Amy Schumer, Reese Witherspoon, Alyssa Milano, Julianne Moore, Mira Sorvino, and Padma Lakshmi. Oprah Winfrey serves as a “visionary ambassador” for the group.

The Post reported that Time’s Up spent $58,395 on travel and $112,435 on Rally, a public relations firm, during 2018. Charity watchdog groups recommend that non-profits spend 75 percent of their revenue on their mission and 25 percent on administration. Time’s Up spent 38 percent on salaries alone, according to the Post.

Last year, Time’s Up experienced a leadership shake-up after sexual harassment allegations were made against the son of then-president Lisa Borders. Tina Tchen succeeded Borders as the head of the group.

732,732,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC’s decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn’t need any “verification” from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O’Sullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

Spoty: Lewis Hamilton in pole position with Doyle only woman on shortlist Read more

“The shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,” a BBC spokesperson said. “On this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.”

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

“This is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards,” he wrote. “I know who I am and what I’ve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don’t vote.”

Fury’s initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury’s team offered a farmer £25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements – citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury’s team to lie. Fury’s subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as “total bullshit”.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury – who earlier that year had claimed that “there are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.”

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn’t changed his mind. “I didn’t enjoy it one bit,” he wrote. “I turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
808,808,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has condemned the behaviour of MEP József Szájer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Szájer’s participation in a “gay orgy” in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

“What our representative, József Szájer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,” said Orbán on Wednesday evening. He said Szájer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orbán’s government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Szájer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary’s constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium’s coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Szájer’s resignation. “He made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,” it read.

Prior to Orbán’s intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

“Mr Szájer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,” said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Szájer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region’s deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him “fleeing along the gutter” to escape the raid.

Szájer admitted he had been at a “house party” but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Szájer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an “open secret” among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Szájer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. “I always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something – just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,” he said. He added that guests had been “completely naked” at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Szájer for possession of drugs. But the “gay orgy” element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Szájer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Szájer boasted that he had drafted Hungary’s new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as “a 21st-century constitution” when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Szájer said: “It depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don’t think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.”

In the intervening decade, Orbán’s government has gone further in its “traditional values” drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed “too gay” for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orbán’s government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, “the mother is a woman and the father is a man”. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government’s justification for the amendment explained that “new, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development”.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Szájer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making “a huge political deal out of a sex scandal” and praised Szájer’s statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary’s government.

988,988,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain’s new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her “delight, after many years of campaigning,” that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens’ right to work and live in UK – a key Brexit ask – or British nationals’ right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

“It will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,” said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. “I built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is … a shock.”

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell’s mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and – like his sister – two dual-nationality children. “We’re very settled; we have careers and families,” said Jessica. “We’re not thinking of going home yet.”

Jessica Frizell and her husband Alberto, Italy. Photograph: handout

But that may change. “My big worry is my mother,” Frizell said. “She’s fit and well, but if she needed looking after … Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now – but not for much longer.”

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, “almost without restriction”.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. “After that,” Godfrey said, “if you want to come back with your non-British partner, you’ll need to earn £18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they’ll have to meet the new points system.”

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs – NHS surcharges, fees – could run into thousands of pounds.

“It’s just a massive change,” said Godfrey. “It basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it’s asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

“It’s a terrible choice, and it’s really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.”

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. “The government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,” Godfrey said.

“It’s extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.”

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. “The government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,” Godfrey said.

“We just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we’re not talking about a never-ending stream of people – it’s a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It’s just nonsense.”

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. “Boris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,” he said.

“We’ve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home – and if we don’t move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It’s hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.”

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship – but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

“If we wanted to move back we’d have to go through so many hoops now,” Woodford said, “and we’re not sure we’d meet the minimum income. It’s seems unfathomable to me … Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.”

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband “could not possibly decide by March 2022” whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

“But how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years – she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that’s been taken away.”

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

“Brexit means I can’t do that now, because I don’t yet have a full residence permit, so I can’t leave Greece for more than three months,” she said. “Then we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that’s not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.”

The couple would be “very unlikely” to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. “It just seems so sad,” she said. “So many people’s choices taken away – all those things my generation could do … And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.”

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

“Daniel may want to come back – not yet, certainly, but at some stage,” Barbara said. “And what’s so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn’t look very fair or equal to me.”

I was wondering why many of the women artists I love were not mothers: Laurie Anderson, Pauline Oliveros, Marina Abramović. I felt sad, as if they had more time for their work because they didn’t have to care for others. As if their solid, amazing work was their babies.”

Earlier this year, I interviewed 50 female artists – Leyton among them – about the impact of motherhood on their work. A similar “sticky thought” has nagged all of them, at one stage or another. Juggling motherhood and any career can be a struggle, but there seems to be something about the role of artist that makes the combination more than usually problematic.

There are the old cliches, of course. Writer Cyril Connolly’s condemnation of petty domesticity – “There is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall” – and Tracey Emin’s oft-quoted line: “There are good artists that have children. Of course there are. They are called men.”

Many artists had received stern warnings about motherhood. “I’ve never known of a woman whose career carries on once they have children,” painter Ishbel Myerscough was informed by an art dealer’s wife. The choice is often presented as binary: art or children.

For five years, the Freelands Foundation has gathered data on the representation of women in the British art world. Tracking figures ranging from the numbers of A-level art students (75% of whom are girls) to the proportion of high-grossing sales at auction by female artists (3%), its latest report, Representation of Female Artists in Britain, lays out a stark parting of fortunes.

According to the report’s data, gathered by the artist and academic Kate McMillan, in career terms, the sharpest divergence between women artists and their male contemporaries occurs after graduation and before gaining commercial recognition. Lest you dare entertain such a thought, that’s not because young male artists make better work. The long-running showcase for recent graduates New Contemporaries is selected “blind”. Figures for the last decade show a roughly even gender balance (if anything New Contemporaries has been fractionally tilted toward female artists: 51%). Yet only 35% of the living artists selected for representation by commercial galleries in Britain are female.

Something seems to start derailing female artists’ careers in their 30s. There are many factors at play, but when I discussed the data with McMillan last year, we felt it was worth exploring a variable that wasn’t factored into the Freelands Foundation reports or similar studies around the world – motherhood. My resulting essay – Full, Messy and Beautiful – was published alongside this year’s report.

Female artists from across the UK responded to my open call to be interviewed about the impact of motherhood on their work. Their experiences ranged from late pregnancy to grandmatriarchy, and they worked in fields as diverse as illustration, sound and performance art. Many wrote or spoke to me at length: outpourings of brutal, painful honesty. Motherhood was not a subject most artists had been invited to talk about before. Many felt they needed to keep the two sides of their identity separate, as though they were somehow operating beneath the radar: secret mothers, infiltrating the house of art.

“My experience,” Anna Perach told me, “is that motherhood is considered a bit taboo in the art world. It is accepted as if the artist ‘sold out’ or joined the bourgeoisie. It’s often met by others in the art community with a mix of underlying feelings of rejection, jealousy, or both.”

The art world is not well structured to accommodate care for young children. Early evening private views, during which artists network and much business gets done, clash precisely with “the holy trinity of supper, bath, bedtime in houses with small kids”, explained WK Lyhne.

Residencies are tough if not impossible for those looking after young children. Childcare can’t be listed as a work expense in applications for Arts Council grants. Very few studio complexes have creche facilities. Some galleries help artists with childcare when installing an exhibition, but they are in the minority. In general, it is the artist mother who is expected to be flexible and accommodating, not the institution.

Art doesn’t come with a fixed wage or an established career trajectory: the making of it doesn’t have an easily quantifiable value. How to justify spending money on childcare? “Paying for time needed to do speculative work, work that might not sell, or not be sold for months or years, is hard to justify,” said Catherine Kurtz.

Things are starting to change. There’s now a Mother Art prize, and there have been recent exhibitions on birth and pregnancy (of course, not all artist mothers make art about motherhood). Specific galleries were praised for being thoughtful and accommodating.

In an industry that deals overwhelmingly in intangible qualities – buzz, aura, image – there is quite simply a problem of perception. “Women artists are marginalised generally,” as Jemima Burrill put it. “Mothers are almost beyond the pale.”

Rather than being treated as unfortunate or even catastrophic, motherhood should be a cause for jubilation. There are – and have been – great artists who were also mothers, among them Artemisia Gentileschi, Barbara Hepworth and Alice Neel. Perhaps if we celebrate them as such we might start to dispel that “sticky thought” that a woman cannot excel as both.

352,352,The Danube’s Imperial Cities & Yuletide Markets River Cruise - MS Geoffrey Chaucer,[],"Day

3

During this morning’s breakfast, we arrive in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. Its communist past now firmly confined to the history books, the city has rediscovered its imperial heritage in its beautifully restored baroque old town whilst the grand white fortress, former seat of the rulers, enjoys commanding views over the river. This morning we will discover more about the city’s interesting history, seeing the main sights and visiting some of the churches to view their traditional Christmas cribs, before you enjoy some free time. Wander the maze of streets, admiring the Christmas decorations until you reach the main square and the market with its cosy atmosphere; the sweet fragrance of cinnamon wafts on the air and hundreds of fairy lights twinkle amongst the branches of the Christmas trees. The pretty red and white stalls groan with inspirational artisan gifts, from decorations, wooden figurines or pottery. Sample some local delicacies too such as potato pancakes or poppy seed strudel but make sure you don’t spoil your appetite as it won’t be long until lunch is served back on board. Afterwards you may wish to return to shore – perhaps to climb the tower of the Old Town Hall for a bird’s eye view of the city and the bustling market below. Alternatively, you may choose to join our optional excursion to Slovensky Grob, a village situated in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, famed for its geese rearing. We will visit a typical Slovak chalet to enjoy a wine tasting of some of the season’s new wines, accompanied by some typical local delicacies. Later we return to the ship where another excellent dinner will be served.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
1018,1018,The BAME women making the outdoors more inclusive,[],"The British countryside being the preserve of the white middle classes is a perception that is backed by stark figures, with ethnic minorities often deterred from heading into the outdoors due to deep-rooted, complex barriers.

At the time of the last census in 2011, 13% of the UK population, around 8.1 million people, identified themselves as black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME). Yet a 2017 study by Natural England found that just 26.2% of black people spent time in the countryside, compared with 44.2% of white people.

According to a separate report, only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds, and statistics from the outdoor sector paint a similar picture, with only around 1% of summer mountain leaders and rock-climbing instructors in the UK from ethnic minorities.

The reasons behind this reluctance to venture out are complicated. Recent Sport England research identifies six barriers to participation in outdoor activities for people from an ethnic minority background: language, awareness, safety, culture, confidence and perception of middle-class stigma.

Even more acute were the findings from a diversity review commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It highlighted that despite people from ethnic minority backgrounds valuing the natural environment and the slow and simple life of rural communities, they felt excluded and conspicuous in what they perceived as an “exclusively English environment”.

Only 1% of visitors to UK national parks come from BAME backgrounds

The report added: “Amongst people from ethnic minority backgrounds, the main factors restricting use of the countryside included the cost of visiting … and problems linked to transport, a lack of knowledge of the English countryside and a lack of ‘cultural habit’ of visiting … There was a fear of discrimination, as well as different patterns of use and a lack of culturally appropriate provisions.”

In June this year, the BBC show Countryfile looked at racial diversity and it was argued that a lack of access to the city for traditional countrysiders was the reason for the disconnection and perceived hostility to minorities. And, in October, one of the show’s presenters, Ellie Harrison, expressed fears about racism still being rife in the British countryside. Harrison, who has presented the show since 2009, raised concern about the amount of racism still taking place and explained that there was still “work to do”.

Over the past few years a number of groups and individuals have been working to address this imbalance, overcoming these barriers by encouraging others to venture out, as wells as urging leading outdoors brands to embrace diversity. The Guardian spoke with three women, hikers Zahrah Mahmood and Rhiane Fatinikun and wild swimmer Omie Dale, all of whom felt it was time to challenge the status quo and make the outdoors more inclusive, and at the same time help others from similar backgrounds see the benefits of what they could achieve when they ventured out.

Zahrah Mahmood, 30, Glasgow: The Hillwalking Hijabi

The first time Mahmood hiked a Munro she found it so difficult she hung up her walking boots and vowed never to return. Five years later, she has climbed more than 30 Munros and has become an inspiration to Muslim women across the country – regularly featuring photographs on her Instagram page of climbing Scotland’s peaks in a traditional Muslim head-covering.

Mahmood took up hiking when a friend coaxed her on to Ben Lomond to reduce the stress of her chartered accountancy exams.

“I found that first hike so difficult. I struggled the whole way up and I could see people staring at me and I didn’t know if it was because I was wearing a hijab, my race or because I was clearly unfit – I imagine it was all three – but it was tough,” she said.

“I had never really exercised before that and to tackle a Munro straight off was just the worst. I struggled and complained … but there was something else, I was the only non-white person in a hijab on the entire walk and I just felt so out of place, so I decided to never return.”

However, Mahmood did return. Shortly after that first hike she joined a gym and embarked on a number of low-level flat walks, including the 26-mile Kiltwalk for charity, and now describes Glen Coe and the Lawers range, which takes in seven Munros, as her favourite places to hike.

“I realised that if I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside and walking helped me. I was able to focus on getting to the end of the walk and I’d come back feeling refreshed – ready to tackle whatever was going on in my life.”

If I was stressed or struggling with something mentally, being outside, and walking really helped me

Mahmood, who regularly prays outdoors during hikes, reveals the challenges of being in the outdoors are not only physical ones. She is often stared at and has suffered racism.

“People look at me all the time and then sometimes I get comments. Often I just brush them off, but when it’s consistently pointed out to you that you don’t fit in, or when you don’t see other people like you, it does have an effect on you.”

“I am not like your normal white adventurer. Sometimes, prayer times fall during a walk so I might have to stop and pray, which can cause more unwanted attention and stares. It shouldn’t be something to be gawked at. While I mostly welcome questions, sometimes I just want to enjoy my time outdoors and switch off.”

Mahmood is now part of a growing movement in Britain that is seeing more people from BAME communities taking up hillwalking. Currently, she is collaborating with outdoor clothing and equipment brand Berghaus, and in the long term hopes to encourage more outdoor brands to embrace diversity.

“Posting a picture of a person of colour on your website or Instagram is performative if it’s not backed up by sustainable action. And, actually, it does more damage than good.”

“Some people may think this is encouraging, but there needs to be meaningful action behind it to back it up.”

In the middle of winter last year, Fatinikun was on a train travelling through the Peak District when she saw a group of hikers disembarking. She was fascinated, and decided almost immediately that she would give it a go – her new year resolution.

For her first walk, purchasing hiking boots and a waterproof jacket just the day before, the former civil servant went out with a group of friends on to the South Pennine Water Trail in Rochdale and she describes feeling relief, grateful to be outside and “doing something really physical”.

“These hikers on the train looked like they were about to go on an adventure and, just like that, on the spot, I decided to take it up. I’d been searching for something different for a while and felt like my life was passing me by. That first walk was just incredible,” she said.

I’d been searching for something different for a while. That first walk was just incredible

As a child, Fatinikun, of Nigerian, Jamaican and English background, never ventured into the countryside but then a few years ago she had a car crash and began to suffer from anxiety.

“I needed something to help me overcome what happened but it wasn’t just the crash there was also this feeling that I wasn’t doing enough with my life and now I have overcome that. It has helped with my confidence in so many ways.”

Wanting to be sociable, Fatinikun decided to set up an Instagram page, Black Girls Hike, allowing others to join her on walks. The page has become a charity, and soon to be social enterprise, with support from sponsors including Berghaus, Lowe Alpine and Vivobarefoot, and Fatinikun has become an inspiration to many black and mixed-heritage women.

“Many people grow up in cities where they experience racism on a daily basis so it feels uncomfortable to them to head out into the countryside – the last bastions of whiteness – where it is even less diverse.”

“I wanted the group to be a space in which black women could feel safe and comfortable in the outdoors. It gives black women the confidence to go to places they might not have done before.”

Pre-pandemic, the group would meet twice a month with more than 500 people, from older women to those in their late teens having joined in. Since lockdown, Fatinikun has been going on solo hikes, often heading to Entwistle Reservoir near her home town of Bolton – one of her favourite walks. Now a qualified lowland leader herself, she has also been focusing on a future goal: helping to train more people from BAME backgrounds to become outdoor instructors.

“There are two things at play here: first, people need to know what they are doing in the outdoors to avoid getting lost, like we once did on Saddleworth Moor! But it is also important that those leading these hikes and activities are from a diverse background; that will stop making people feel like the countryside is not for them.”

Whether it was plunging into the waters of the Nene valley near the Cambridgeshire village of Castor or diving into the sea on the Norfolk coast, Dale, spent much of her childhood swimming outdoors.

Her family rarely went on holiday abroad, instead collecting tokens from the Sun for cheap UK trips. On these UK breaks in “grubby holiday homes”, Dale remembers being encouraged, in particular, by her Gambian mother, to swim in the outdoors come “rain or shine”.

“My dad was a confident swimmer, but my mum wasn’t and so it was kind of non-negotiable – she didn’t want us to have the same anxieties as her, it was an activity we had to do whether in an outdoor pool, the sea or a lake – we would be in the water within minutes of arriving,” she said.

“Sometimes I didn’t even have a towel and I would just jump in. I have always found the water such a comfortable place to be.”

There are so many good things about swimming outside: it’s so beautiful

Now Dale is focusing on diversity in outdoor swimming, both on Instagram and through swim groups, particularly in collaboration with Mental Health Swims. She is also hoping to set up open water sessions in south London for all levels, including beginners, and trying to remove the barriers for those who would otherwise not swim. And as a volunteer for the Black Swimming Association, she has been exploring the issue of diversity in aquatics and the leisure industry.

“With swimming it is doubly difficult for people from BAME backgrounds, because you’ve already got the existing challenges of swimming itself, and then the unfounded stereotypes of black people not being able to swim.

“It can be overwhelming as a newbie, especially if no one looks like you on top of issues like water fear, cleanliness, knowing about currents – all of that makes it quite an exclusive activity.

“There are so many good things about swimming outside: it’s so beautiful and the mental health benefits are incredible, but there is a lot of work to do to get certain groups of people believing that it is something they can do and will enjoy.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
306,306,Biden Reportedly Mulls Promoting ‘Taliban Bounties Story’ Congresswoman to be CIA Director,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Joe Biden began announcing picks for his cabinet this week, even as incumbent Donald Trump continues to refuse to concede, citing alleged widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, Biden selected Antony Blinken – his former vice-presidential national security adviser and a proponent of war in Iraq, Libya and Syria – for the key post of secretary of state.

The Biden camp is actively considering naming Democrat congresswoman for Michigan, Elissa Slotkin – a former CIA analyst, senior Pentagon official and Iraq War intelligence operative – as his CIA director, the New York Times has reported, citing people said to be familiar with the deliberations.

The 44-year-old New York City native is known to have served three tours of duty in Iraq as a CIA militia expert during the late Bush and early Obama administrations, and then to have gone on to work at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and for the National Security Council. In 2012, she moved to the Pentagon and, in 2015, was tapped for the role of acting secretary of defence for international security affairs.

At the Defence Department, Slotkin was involved in ramping up the scale of US military operations on Russia’s western borders, and at the same time charged with ensuring ‘deconfliction’ between Russian and US military aircraft in Syria. Her responsibilities are also said to have included drone and cyber warfare, as well as homeland defence.

During her bid for Congress in 2018, the World Socialist Website named Slotkin as one of ‘The CIA Democrats’, ie, one of a peculiarly large body of former intelligence and military personnel seeking to compete for vulnerable Republican-held seats in the mid-term elections.

Criticism of Trump

Slotkin co-authored an op-ed in The Detroit News last week urging Donald Trump to concede the election. In October, she reportedly expressed concerns that America might be ‘hurtling toward’ a constitutional crisis based on Trump’s allegations of plans by the Democrats to rig the election.

Slotkin has attacked Trump on a range of foreign policy matters, from his Iran policy, to his corruption probe against the Biden family’s alleged corruption in Ukraine (which she said warranted Trump’s impeachment), to what she characterised as his strange relationship with Russia.

In the summer of 2020, when the New York Times, the Washington Post and other US media reported the (since debunked) claims by ‘anonymous intelligence officials’ that Russia had offered the Taliban* bounties for US troops’ heads, Slotkin blasted Trump over his many telephone conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and suggested that there was “something… off about” the relationship between the two men “since the beginning,” with Americans “quite literally paying in blood for [Trump’s] pandering to Putin”, in Afghanistan.

The White House, Russian officials and the Taliban have since dismissed the ‘bounty’ claims, with the militia accusing the Afghan government of deliberately seeking to derail the withdrawal of US troops from the war-torn Central Asian nation.

In October, Slotkin asked Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to brief congress on the extent of the alleged threat posed by Russia and Iran to the US election process, claiming that the Russian and Iranian efforts “remain persistent and sadly effective in sowing distrust and division among the American people”.

Slotkin made headlines last week when she said she would not support Nancy Pelosi’s bid to be speaker of the House, briefly causing speculation about serious divisions in the Democrat Party. Pelosi handily won re-election as speaker anyway, with no one stepping up to challenge her.

597,597,Why has wedding of Japan's Princess Mako still not gone ahead?,[],"They have been together since university, their emotional bond apparently stronger than ever despite being separated by an ocean and a continent. And they have the blessing of a likely future emperor.

But for Japan’s Princess Mako – the eldest daughter of the first in line to the Chrysanthemum throne – and her boyfriend, Kei Komuro, the sound of wedding bells has grown more distant in the three years since they made their relationship public.

The couple are no closer to exchanging vows after their plans to marry two years ago were derailed by revelations that the would-be groom’s mother was embroiled in a financial dispute. The saga has not only fuelled unusually intrusive media and public interest in the private lives of Japan’s royals; it has also brought the country’s succession crisis into sharp relief.

Japan celebrated when, in May 2017, Mako and Komuro, a contemporary at International Christian University in Tokyo who does not come from a royal background, said they planned to get engaged later in the year and marry in November 2018. But in February 2018, the imperial household agency said the wedding had been put off for two years following reports that Komuro’s mother owed money, including education fees for her son, to an ex-fiance. A date for the wedding has yet to be set.

This week, Mako’s father, Crown Prince Akishino, gave the marriage his blessing but suggested that the couple, who are both 29, had yet to win over a sceptical Japanese public, who will foot the bill for a lump sum Mako will receive when she marries and leaves the imperial household.

“I approve of them getting married,” he said in comments to journalists ahead of his 55th birthday on Monday. “The constitution says that marriage shall be based only on the mutual consent of both sexes. I believe I, as a parent, should respect their intentions if marriage is what they truly want.”

But, he added, Komuro’s family needed to make a “visible” response to his mother’s financial troubles, which, according to Japanese media, have not been resolved two years after they were revealed by a weekly magazine.

Akishino, who became crown prince after his elder brother, Naruhito, ascended the throne last year, was quoted by the Kyodo news agency as saying: “From my point of view, I don’t think they are in a situation in which many people are convinced and pleased [about their proposed marriage]” – adding that Mako was aware that the public was not fully behind the union.

When Mako marries, she will immediately lose her royal status and, like the previous emperor’s daughter, Sayako Kuroda, live a comparatively “ordinary” life with her commoner husband beyond the walls of the imperial palace in Tokyo.

The family she leaves behind will shrink again. As the Asahi Shimbun newspaper has pointed out, only seven members of the imperial family are below 40, and all but one of them are women. Under Japan’s succession laws, no female member of the imperial family – not even the emperor’s 19-year-old daughter, Aiko – can become a reigning monarch.

No Japanese administration has shown an appetite for revising the 1947 succession law since the maverick conservative, Junichiro Koizumi, saw his reform plans fizzle out after the 2006 birth of Prince Hisahito, Mako’s younger brother and the first male to be born into the imperial family for 40 years.

While the birth of Hisahito, who is second in line to the throne, gave the family a one-generation reprieve, if he does not go on to have a son an imperial line some believe stretches back 2,500 years will come to an end.

A potential constitutional crisis will be furthest from the thoughts of Mako and Komuro, who is studying for a law degree at Fordham University in New York, as they consider their next move, including a suggestion by her father that they offer the public an explanation once they have agreed on a wedding date.

The two consider each other “irreplaceable”, the princess said recently, adding that they thought of each other as “someone to rely on, during both happy times and unhappy times”.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

311,311,"DATA: Biden Needed 130% Of Vote To ‘Win’ Arizona, Trump Needed -30% To Lose",[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Scientist, engineer, politician, entrepreneur, and four-time Massachusetts Institute of Technology degree holder Dr. Shiva Ayyadurai delved deep into Arizona’s 2020 presidential election vote tabulation data during the state’s election integrity hearing on Monday.

Dr. Ayyadurai revealed that pattern recognition software that tried to replicate the curve of Joe Biden’s reported vote total could only match the reported results if votes for Biden were counted at a 130% rate – in other words, every Democrat ballot counting for 1.3 votes to Trump’s 1.0.

Dr. Ayyadurai’s software tried numerous solutions to replicate the curve of Biden’s vote count in 734 Arizona precincts, and “the only one that we were able to come close to matching was this, and I want everyone to look at this carefully. The interesting possibility we find here is that when the Democrat percentage is 130% Mr. Biden, and -30% Mr. Trump… it matches perfectly. Near perfectly. The slopes match, the curves match the shapes match.”

“So what that tells us is that this demographic distribution of allocation of party affiliations is what can generate this, and I find it highly implausible because this means that Mr. Biden got 130% of Democrat voters, and President Trump got negative 30%,” Dr. Ayyadurai stated.

Dr. Ayyadurai found that there were two possibilities for such an implausible descrepancy: either there was a niche demographic of Independent Biden voters that existed beyond the computer model’s ability to replicate the curve, or Biden’s votes were multiplied by 1.3 (130%).

In the latter scenario, President Trump’s vote totals would have to be reduced by 30% in accordance with the 130% gained by Biden, a scenario could only occur through swapping preexisting votes between the two candidates.

“So basically, votes were being eaten from President Trump and being handed over to Mr. Biden,” Dr. Ayyadurai noted.

572,572,"Humanity is waging war on nature, says UN secretary general",[],"Humanity is facing a new war, unprecedented in history, the secretary general of the UN has warned, which is in danger of destroying our future before we have fully understood the risk.

The stark message from António Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes … Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.”

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible – and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump’s vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

“Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,” he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. “It must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.”

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. “This is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test … We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable – even in rich countries – were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Niña weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: “I firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year – the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.”

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to “flick the green switch” while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days’ time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: “We need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.”

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. “Next year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,” he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. “There is no vaccine against climate warming,” he warned. “But there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.”

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

“Money, money, money,” said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. “The question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.”

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK’s spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host’s leverage in bringing developing countries together.

“A country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,” she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melania Trump walked through the White House, putting the finishing touches on this year’s Christmas decorations, wearing a metallic lamé blouse by Dries Van Noten and a high-waisted black pencil skirt.

The blouse, similar to the shades of silver and gold adorned across the decor, retails for about $1,060.

Mrs. Trump paired the blouse and skirt with a thin gold Ralph Lauren belt and black Christian Louboutin pointed stilettos, a staple of her wardrobe.

154,154,"Bette Midler: Doctors Should Sue over SCOTUS Protecting Rights of ‘Super Spreader’ Churches, Synagogues",['David Ng'],"Bette Midler wants doctors and nurses to sue over the Supreme Court’s recent 5-4 ruling confirming the First Amendment rights of people to gather for religious purposes. The Hollywood star said that these “super spreader” events will eventually become a burden on health-care workers.

On Monday, Midler tweeted her disbelief that the high court is allowing people to gather in houses of worship.

“Packing the Supreme Court really works, but for whom? Why do the religious get to gather in super spreader groups, if they will sicken rest of us?” she wrote. “And when they get sick why should any stressed out health-care worker be forced to look after them? Doctors and nurses should sue.”

The Hocus Pocus star made no mention of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations and riots that have taken place in cities across the country, bringing together thousands of protestors in close proximity during the coronavirus pandemic.

And when they get sick why should any stressed out health-care worker be forced to look after them? Doctors and nurses should sue. — bettemidler (@BetteMidler) November 27, 2020

Midler also expressed her support for virtual religious services where worshippers practice their faith remotely.

As Breitbart News reported, the Supreme Court’s ruling represents a major victory for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Orthodox Jewish synagogues in their fight against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s (D) restrictions, which limited house of worship attendance to 10 to 25 people. The plaintiffs argued that the limits violated religious freedom under the First Amendment.

Newly confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the majority in the case, while Chief Justice John Roberts sided with liberal Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor.

Bette Midler vocally opposed President Donald Trump’s Constitutional right to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsberg’s Supreme Court seat. She attacked Coney Barrett for her religious affiliations while calling her “the ultimate product” of the Koch brothers, the Heritage Foundation, and other conservative groups.

#AmyConeyBarret, on Board of a school that won’t allow in a student with a gay parent, has been groomed for decades, the ultimate product of #theKochs, #TheFederalists, #TheHeritageFoundation.

960,960,'Mini Brexit': Margaret Thatcher's statue divides her hometown,[],"For a small town in Lincolnshire, which Margaret Thatcher once called home, it’s been an issue as divisive as Brexit: Should Grantham erect a statue commemorating the UK’s first female prime minister?

It’s a simple enough question, but the process of erecting a statue of the Iron Lady, created by sculptor Douglas Jennings has been a long, painstaking and arduous process. The statue was rejected by Westminster council in central London in 2018 because councillors feared it would be a magnet for vandalism and protests.

It was then offered to her home town of Grantham and, following a brisk debate by the planning committee, was approved in 2018. Some hoped that would be the end of it, but the statue remained stored away.

The council’s controversial decision to underwrite a £100,000 unveiling ceremony on Tuesday then reignited the debate on whether the statue should be erected. The vote, in the middle of a global pandemic that has sparked the deepest recession in a generation, has been heavily criticised.

Lee Steptoe, chair of Grantham Labour, said: “We find that in the middle of a pandemic, when the public coffers both on a national level and a local level, are emptying very quickly, their sense of priorities to be absolutely perverse.”

He added: “She was arguably the most divisive prime minister this country’s has ever had and this is an incredibly divisive decision by the local Tories.”

For Amanda Schonhut, director of fundraising for Grantham Museum, which is run by Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA), had been pushing to have the statue stand on a green midway between two existing statues, one of the 19th-century MP Frederick James Tollemache and another of Sir Isaac Newton, this is an important step forward.

“It’s been a long hard road. There’s been a few knocks and bumps along the way,” Schonhut said. “It’s nice to see things finally coming to fruition.”

She was keen to stress that the cost of the unveiling would come from private donations, but accepts the issue will continue to divide the town. “It’s been a bit like a mini Brexit,” she said. She hopes it’ll attract visitors to the museum and the local area.

Labour have called for the statue to be displayed within the museum.

Adam Burgess who lives in Stamford said he was ashamed by the announcement that the council would underwrite the unveiling . “In the area we’re living in we’re seeing a huge number of homeless people, we’re seeing food banks springing up all over the place.”

Burgess added that given Thatcher’s controversial legacy it was a “poorly judged decision” to push ahead with the statue. “There’s got to be better ways to spend that money. To erect a statue of someone who was so divisive and caused a lot of heartache for the working class just seemed like a pretty shit decision, to be honest.”

Ralph Harrison, a retired civil servant who lives in Grantham, disagreed and was pleased that the statue will be put up and soon be unveiled. “It’s a relatively small town that has produced somebody that is known in the world stage and will be in the history books.

“I appreciate there are lots of different views on Margaret Thatcher, she is a very controversial figure, but it’s a question of achievement. She achieved something when becoming the first woman prime minister.”

Independent councillor Ashley Baxter said there had been two notable changes since the council gave permission for the statue to be erected. “The first significant change is that we are now being told that there is a risk that we will have to underwrite the cost of the unveiling event. And the second thing is the whole statue controversy leading with Black Lives Matter and the Edward Coulson statue incident in Bristol and statues around the world. People are questioning a lot more the merit of having statues of divisive figures.”

He added: “I think we really need to think carefully before we go ahead with this, in terms of the policing, in terms of security, in terms of the reputation of the town, there are questions to be asked.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
707,707,'The scientists have done it': Boris Johnson hails Covid vaccine,[],"Boris Johnson has declared that the nation is no longer resting on the hope of a return to normality by spring but instead has the “certain knowledge” that people can reclaim their lives, as he hailed the arrival of the newly approved Covid-19 vaccine.

The prime minister told a Downing Street press conference on Wednesday that “the scientists have done it”, although he stressed that people should not get carried away with “over-optimism”, insisting that they continue to abide by the rules.

The UK is the first western country to license a vaccine against coronavirus, and mass immunisation is expected to begin next week. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been authorised for emergency use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) before decisions by the US and Europe.

When and how will I be able to get a Covid vaccine in the UK? Read more

Striking an upbeat tone, Johnson said: “We’re no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love.”

He added: “We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill. And now the scientists have done it, and they have used the virus itself to perform a kind of biological jiu-jitsu, to turn the virus on itself in the form of a vaccine.”

There were still “immense logistical challenges”, he said. “So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected. Long, cold months. So it’s all the more vital that, as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we’re not carried away with over-optimism or fall into the naive belief that the struggle is over.”

As England entered a new strengthened tiered system of coronavirus restrictions on Wednesday, Johnson pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.

Speaking alongside him, the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had become emotional watching that morning’s press conference announcing the vaccine’s approval. “And what a momentous … journey and international effort it has been,” Van-Tam said. “Discovery by two scientists who originally lived in Turkey, development by a German biotech company, involvement of a massive US pharmaceutical giant, and then involvement of our own UK MHRA to bring home the goods.”

However, he too cautioned that the rollout would take months rather than weeks, and that restrictions including social distancing must stay in place. “If we relax too soon, if we just kind of go, ‘Oh, the vaccine’s here, let’s abandon caution,’ all you are going to do is create a tidal wave of infections.”

Asked whether Johnson was failing to protect the most vulnerable if care home residents did not end up getting the vaccine first, Van-Tam said it was a “complex product” and “really tricky to handle”, explaining: “It’s not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in multiple times.”

Van-Tam said he did not think humankind was “going to eradicate coronavirus ever”, but we may get to the point where it becomes “a seasonal problem” like flu. He added: “Do I think there will come a big moment where we have a massive party … and say, ‘That’s it, it’s behind us,’ like the end of the war? No, I don’t.”

Johnson responded: “That may be a good thing ... on the other hand, we may want to get back to life as pretty much as close to normal.”

394,394,Tourists flock to Four Seasons Total Landscaping after Giuliani debacle,[],"Once far off the beaten path in north-east Philadelphia, the snappilynamed Four Seasons Total Landscaping has become fertile ground for selfie tourism since November’s presidential election.

The owner of the commercial gardening company has spoken out about her “overwhelming” experience, after the business went down in political infamy as the backdrop to a bizarre Trump campaign press conference on the day that the president lost the election to Joe Biden.

In an interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, Marie Siravo said the business, which offers a range of grounds maintenance services, had been besieged by visitors, gifts and even requests to host weddings.

“Not a day goes by where there’s not a crowd outside,” Siravo said.

The unprepossessing Four Seasons Total Landscaping office found itself the subject of international attention when Donald Trump’s election team chose it to host a press conference contesting the results of the election.

Rudy Giuliani was the main draw at the event, where he made baseless accusations of fraud and, mid-event, learned that Joe Biden had been declared the winner.

“Don’t be ridiculous,” was Giuliani’s response, adding that judges would decide the result, not voters.

Since Giuliani’s 8 November appearance, fans of Four Seasons Total Landscaping have reportedly sent the business cheesesteaks, gift cards, fruit baskets and even beard oil, Siravo said. And tourists have worn a trail to her door, posing and posting pictures of themselves on social media, or spoofs such as the now-disappeared Utah metal monolith/desert litter superimposed in front of the premises.

Breaking News: Utah Monolith reappears at Four Seasons Total Landscaping. Selected by WH to replace AG Bill Barr. (totally legit photo!). pic.twitter.com/KBgJ6kCQgB — Lar (@lartist) December 1, 2020

At Thanksgiving, two sisters met outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping for their holiday meal, Siravo said, while a woman brought her children to stage their holiday card photo with the business as the backdrop.

Others have requested selfies with the business’s branded vehicles, and some have asked if they can hold a party or even wedding at the business, according to the Inquirer.

“This is a construction yard, that’s a liability,” Siravo said drily. The press attention has led to one change, however.

“It did make us paint the back of the building, because we said, ‘Who knew that our garage doors were going to be the back of every Zoom meeting?’”

Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which is memorably located next to a sex shop, swiftly became a byword for politicians’ incompetence and a source of hilarity after the press conference, as people speculated as to whether the Trump campaign had confused the business with the Four Seasons hotel, located in downtown Philadelphia.

Trump himself lent weight to the idea of mistaken identity when he tweeted, then deleted, that the press conference was at “Four Seasons, Philadelphia”.

Four Seasons Total Landscaping poured water on the theory, however.

“That’s not the case,” said Sean Middleton, director of sales.

“I gave them the address, I said where we were, where they can meet us, and that was that.”

Four Seasons Total Landscaping moved swiftly to capitalize on the interest. The company expanded its merchandise range to include tree ornaments, sweaters, hoodies, and face masks.

Demand has been high, with the company reportedly selling more than 35,000 products since the Giuliani appearance, totaling $1.3m in sales.

“The response is overwhelming, that there’s still so, so many good people in the world, and they got to laugh with this,” Siravo said.

“And it was nothing we anticipated.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
927,927,Mt Toubkal Long Weekend - Winter,[],"Mt Toubkal, you tricky customer

With our 50th birthdays looming, a few friends decided to take on a challenge. Onto the Exodus website we went... All 4 of us are fairly fit so decided a ""challenging"" level would be just the ticket! Mt Toubkal did not disappoint! It was definitely a challenge! Who knew it could rain and snow so much in August? Because we followed the trip notes, universal packing and read some reviews, we believed we were ready! We just didn't account for the altitude sickness! This took 3 of us out and only one of us made it to the summit.

What was the most inspirational moment of your trip? For me, it was the summit and just before! The hours before the summit were extremely difficult as you are hiking in the dark with just a head torch, following the boots of the person in front. It was steep, raining/hailing so it was slow going. When we stopped just shy of the summit, we witnessed the most amazing sight: A rainbow over the High Atlas Mountains! It was worth all the rain to see this sight. After waking up at 330am, hiking for 4+ hours, the summit was a sight to behold! (even if it was snowing in August... in Morocco... yes, snow in August!)

What did you think of your group leader? Ilyas our group leader and Abdul his assistant were amazing!!! With 3 of my friends ill with altitude sickness, Abdul took incredible care of them. Both Ilyas and Abdul have a great sense of humour and made us all laugh. After 2 days we understood ""Ilyas time"" (ie 5 min in our time is 10 in Ilyas time) and his love of telling time in seconds! Ilyas organised our day well and I now miss someone telling me when to wake up, when to eat and when to start walking! They both gave us a great insight into Moroccan culture and the religion of Islam. I have left knowing I will have a ""home away from home"" in Morocco! Ilyas also organised tours and spa visits on our last day in Marrakesh. He was great!!

Do you have any advice for potential travellers? Be prepared! Be fit! It is definitely NOT a walk in the park. Pack for all weathers including a rain cover for your day pack or at least a dry bag for inside the pack. Also I found sticks a must for descending. And have a head torch, not just a hand held torch because you need your hands to clamber over large rocks ets (also bring extra batteries just in case). Because you start and finish the summit ascent at the refuge, make sure you have clean dry WARM clothes ready for your return to the refuge. Drinks are not served with dinner at the refuge so make sure you have money to buy a drink from the shop or have a bottle of water ready. Also make sure you have dirham change for the hike as you stop at various places to buy juices on the way to the refuge. They won't take big denominations of dirham. Also, its best to have EUROs or Dirhams. Not many places were happy with £ or USD.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

109,109,Stacey Abrams to Coach Hollywood Elites on How They Can Help Win Georgia,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Georgia is now ground zero for the battle for the balance of power in Washington, D.C., as control of the U.S. Senate now hinges on the outcome of the two Senate runoff races. With the Senate majority leadership just a couple seats away, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) recently declared, “Now we take Georgia, and then we change America.” And failed Georgia gubernatorial candidate and Democratic Party power player Stacey Abrams is more than willing to do her part to see that Schumer’s goal is realized.

Starting on Friday, Abrams will brief Hollywood agents, managers, publicists, and entertainment executives on how they can help elect Georgia U.S. Senate Democrat candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock ahead of the runoff elections in according to the Hollywood Reporter.

On January 5, Georgia will have its runoff elections between senator Kelly Loeffler (R) and candidate Raphael Warnockas (D), as well as senator David Perdue (R) and candidate Jon Ossoff (D).

Abrams’ organization Fair Fight is enlisting celebrities like Selena Gomez, Yara Shahidi, Issa Rae, Keke Palmer and Steph Curry for voting videos, as well as dumping millions of dollars to assist over a dozen organizations in their efforts ahead of the runoffs.

“I believe very much in the power of celebrity to cut through the noise of politics,” Abrams said last week.

Celebrities also now believe that they have a vested interest in the turning the state blue, as tax incentives have brought Hollywood productions from California to Georgia in recent years, bringing the celebrities and other staff to the traditionally red state.

“Being someone who worked in Georgia for two years while I shot [Netflix series] Insatiable, I’m really aware of how powerful and impactful the organizers are,” said actress and political activist Alyssa Milano.

New Georgia Project executive director Nse Ufot echoed those sentiments.

“We’ve been talking for quite a bit of time about how we are trying to change the culture of voting — what better way to do that than by partnering with culture workers, people who are literally responsible for helping us shift the narrative and tell better stories about ourselves,” said Ufot. “Our state is growing by leaps and bounds because of an influx of storytellers and people who support them. I think that that could be a secret weapon as we think about the new Georgia.”

LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of the Marxist political organization Black Voters Matter, echoed those sentiments as well, and claimed, “we’re not the headquarters for Southern white male racists” now that Hollywood has imposed itself.

“We’ve seen this transition — Georgia is the number one place for film productions, so this city has become more internationalized, I think one,” said Brown. “I think it’s been attractive to bringing diverse folks to the state.”

Barack Obama chastised Democratic political candidates for using “snappy” slogans like “defund the police” that he argued could turn voters away, in an interview released this week.

“You lost a big audience the minute you say it, which makes it a lot less likely that you’re actually going to get the changes you want done,” the former president told show host Peter Hamby in an interview with Good Luck America, a Snapchat political show.

Here's what interviewing voters taught me about the slogan 'defund the police' | Danny Barefoot Read more

“The key is deciding, do you want to actually get something done, or do you want to feel good among the people you already agree with?” Obama added.

However, Obama also defended the place of young progressives as important “new blood” in the Democratic party, singling out Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez – who has spoken out strongly on the phrase and the essence of defunding police departments to boost social spending.

Former Obama campaign operative Ben LaBolt shared part of the president’s interview with Hamby online on Tuesday before the full interview went live on Snapchat on Wednesday.

The remarks drew immediate backlash from notable, Black progressive Democrats – including the Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who stressed “defund the police” was not about mere words but a “demand for equitable investments and budgets for communities across the country”.

“We didn’t lose Breonna because of a ‘slogan’,” said Kentucky state representative Charles Booker, referencing Breonna Taylor, the Black, Louisville woman who was shot dead in her own apartment by police in March during a botched raid.

Booker broke barriers in 2018 when he became the youngest Black lawmaker elected to the Kentucky state legislature in nearly a century. And he ran a close contest for the Democratic nomination to challenge – ultimately unsuccessfully – the Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell’s seat in the November election.

Charles Booker (@Booker4KY) We didn’t lose Breonna because of a slogan.



Instead of conceding this narrative, let’s shape our own. It’s time we listen to the people, organize and build coalitions around our own message, and cast a vision that inspires us all to lead for change at the ballot box and beyond. https://t.co/mBg7wanaR6

Cori Bush, who made history last month by becoming the first Black woman elected to represent Missouri in Congress shot back at Obama that “Defund the Police” was “not a slogan. It’s a mandate for keeping [Black] people alive.”

“With all due respect, Mr President – let’s talk about losing people,” she said. “We lost Michael Brown Jr. We lost Breonna Taylor. We’re losing our loved ones to police violence.”

The Black Lives Matter movement member’s rise in politics stemmed from her work as a community activist during protests against the shooting death of Mike Brown in Ferguson in 2014.

Bush is also the only candidate to formally run on a platform of defunding the police – a point many analysts say make criticism of the movement unwarranted.

Defund the Police has been a widely used phrase and policy initiative that gained traction over the summer as racial justice and anti-policing protests erupted in response to the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police in May.

As a policy initiative, defunding police departments involves the reallocation of local and state resources away from law enforcement into public services, designed to address issues of poverty, inequality and mental health – factors that contribute to crime.

The former president’s comments echoed other moderate Democrats who have taken issue and consider the phrase polarizing, prompting criticism of a progressive movement led by what some have called radical messaging.

In South Carolina, where the Democratic base is largely composed of Black Americans who skew older and moderate, the Democratic incumbent Joe Cunningham lost his House seat to Republican Nancy Mace in the November election.

In the days following, the South Carolina congressman and House minority whip James Clyburn, who was regarded as instrumental in turning around Joe Biden’s flagging campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination when the moderate was behind leftist champion Bernie Sanders, told NBC News the slogan hurt some Democratic candidates.

“If you instead say ‘Let’s reform the police department so that everybody’s being treated fairly,’” Clyburn offered alternatively. “Not just in policing, but in sentencing, how can we divert young people from getting into crime?’”

While Obama took issue with progressive slogans, he also criticized moderate leadership for failing to recognize the increasingly powerful influence of young, progressives such as Ocasio-Cortez.

The former president chastised the Democratic National Committee for only briefly featuring such democratic socialists in their opening montage during their national convention in Milwaukee in August.

“She speaks to a broad section of young people who are interested in what she has to say, even if they don’t agree with everything she says. You give her a platform,” he said, adding that across political ideologies “new blood is always good” for the party.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

440,440,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Israel’s parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday’s vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz’s Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday’s bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country’s longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

“Netanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,” Gantz said. “Show me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country’s budget.”

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: “Netanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.”

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. “Now is not the time for elections,” Netanyahu said. “Now is the time for unity.”

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

“I was well aware of his track record as a ‘serial promise-breaker’, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn’t happen,” Gantz said on Tuesday.

“Netanyahu didn’t lie to me – he lied to all of you.”

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

“Netanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,” Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

“[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,” wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

“The prime minister’s ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
607,607,The Guardian view on Poland’s Catholics: losing faith in their church,[],"During the five years in which the Law and Justice (PiS) party has governed in Poland, the lines between politics and religion have become, to put it mildly, blurred. In a sermon last week, for example, the archbishop of Kraków, Marek Jędraszewski, offered episcopal backing for the government’s refusal to sign off on the European Union’s Covid recovery fund.

By linking the fund to a controversial “rule of law” clause, Archbishop Jędraszewski said, Brussels was seeking to impose a “neo-Marxist vision of a new order that rejects God’s kingdom”. The clause, he claimed, was a Trojan horse that would be used to impose abortion on demand, gender “ideology” in schools and other assorted liberal heresies. Bishops and prelates have also lined up alongside the government during its culture wars over Muslim refugees and LGBTQ+ rights. As clerics and ministers operate in authoritarian symbiosis, Poland has at times resembled a theocracy in the heart of the EU.

Ultra-conservatives such as Archbishop Jędraszewski have revelled in this proximity to secular power. But there are intriguing indications that the most influential church in Europe may have overplayed its hand. Increasing numbers of Poles, it seems, are growing tired of being bullied by bishops. A survey earlier this year found that only 35% now take a positive view of the church. Among young people that figure fell to 9%. The number of priests abandoning their vocations is among the highest in Europe.

October’s controversial abortion ruling by Poland’s constitutional court, which, if ratified, would amount to a near-total ban, has generated a huge backlash. The Polish bishops’ conference warned Catholics not to take part in the mass protests that followed the judgment. As some demonstrations targeted churches, PiS’s leader, Jarosław Kaczyński, called on Poles to “defend the church at any price”. But the strength of feeling is such that old taboos are losing their hold. Protests against the court ruling have taken place in small communities where the local church’s authority has seldom been challenged. In one town near Warsaw, the hands of a statue of Saint John Paul II were daubed with red paint.

Sexual abuse scandals highlighted in the Polish media have also significantly eroded trust. John Paul II’s judgment was criticised in last month’s Vatican report into abuse by the disgraced ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick. The former pope’s secretary, Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, has been accused of covering up abuse cases in the Polish church. Many Poles believe that the church’s steadfast support for the PiS government has ensured a hands-off approach by the government into allegations of abuse.

Under Mr Kaczyński, PiS has pioneered a politics that weaponises Christianity in the service of an illiberal nationalism that targets minorities and flouts European norms. Viktor Orbán’s Hungary borrows from the same playbook. In Italy, the leader of the rightwing League party, Matteo Salvini, is rarely seen these days without a rosary. Co-opting scripture for short-term political gain may make sense for opportunistic politicians, but for churches, going along with it is a dangerous game. Last month, a group of prominent priests and lay Catholics called on the Polish church to distance itself from PiS and to “abandon anything which, in the eyes of many, including Catholics, smacks of a throne-altar alliance”. Their statement denounced attempts to “exploit the church for the political interests of the ruling party”. If the country’s ecclesiastical hierarchy is wise, it will pay heed. According to one survey this year, a big majority of Poles still consider themselves religious. But they are rapidly losing faith in their bishops.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
641,641,Global sustainable fishing initiative agreed by 14 countries,[],"Governments responsible for 40% of the world’s coastlines have pledged to end overfishing, restore dwindling fish populations and stop the flow of plastic pollution into the seas in the next 10 years.

The leaders of the 14 countries set out a series of commitments on Wednesday that mark the world’s biggest ocean sustainability initiative, in the absence of a fully fledged UN treaty on marine life.

The countries – Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal – will end harmful subsidies that contribute to overfishing, a key demand of campaigners. They will also aim to eliminate illegal fishing through better enforcement and management, and to minimise bycatch and discards, as well as implementing national fisheries plans based on scientific advice.

Each of the countries, members of the High Level Panel for Sustainable Ocean Economy, has also pledged to ensure that all the areas of ocean within its own national jurisdiction – known as exclusive economic zones – are managed sustainably by 2025. That amounts to an area of ocean roughly the size of Africa.

Erna Solberg, the prime minister of Norway, said: “Humanity’s wellbeing is deeply intertwined with the health of the ocean. It sustains us, stabilises the climate and leads to greater prosperity. For too long, we have perceived a false choice between ocean protection and production. No longer. We understand the opportunities of action and the risks of inaction, and we know the solutions. Building a sustainable ocean economy is one of the greatest opportunities of our time.”

Scott Morrison, the prime minister of Australia, said: “Australians have always had a deep connection to the ocean. It is an integral part of who we are: our culture, lives and livelihoods … When I speak to children in schools in Australia, pollution destroying our oceans is what they talk to me about. Along with the Ocean Panel Leaders, we are committing to sustainably manage 100% of our ocean areas by 2025 and we encourage other world leaders to join us.”

Research has found that if oceans were sustainably managed, they could provide six times more food than today, when many species are fished up to and beyond their recovery limits. Economists also calculate that for every $1 invested in sustainable oceans, there is about $5 return in economic, social, environmental and health benefits, and that sustainably managing the world’s oceans would create about 12m new jobs.

Jane Lubchenco, the administrator of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration under President Obama, told the Guardian the initiative was “a really big deal” and could restore the health of the world’s oceans, as well as benefiting the global economy and societies.

“What you have now is a hodgepodge [of ocean management], sector by sector, it’s not holistic. That does nothing to help recover the health of the underlying ecosystems, and we are seeing a loss of biodiversity, climate change running rampant – business as usual would just continue the decline of the oceans,” she said. “The oceans are in a very sorry state right now.”

With the more coordinated response envisaged by the High Level Panel, there was a chance that the destruction could be halted, she said. “We are beginning to understand that the ocean is really central to all our lives.”

The 14 world leaders want other countries to join the panel, to create a global sustainable ocean plan that they said could also have a major influence on the climate. One fifth of the reductions in emissions needed to meet the Paris agreement goal, of holding global heating to no more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, could come from the oceans, according to the panel, by improving the ability of the oceans to absorb carbon and by investing in technologies such as offshore wind.

Solberg said: “If we manage oceans sustainably it will be good for all our people. To have secure jobs, you will have to work with other countries.”

Their commitments also include: a global target to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, alongside setting out national plans by 2025 that would ensure local sustainability; to use technology to improve the monitoring of fishing; to eliminate the discarding of “ghost” fishing gear; to invest in sewage and waste management infrastructure in developing countries; to place national targets on decarbonising shipping transport; and to scale up environmentally responsible forms of fish farming.

Some of the work of restoring health to the oceans must also take place on land. In a report, the leaders set out the case for shifting to a “circular economy that would prevent plastic pollution from reaching the sea, and improving agricultural regulation on land to halt the spread of “dead zones” from fertiliser and manure runoff.

Henrik Österblom, the science director at the Stockholm Resilience Centre, said: “[This initiative] shows that politicians are listening to the science. Now they need to act. The ocean is not too big to fail. If we do not change course, key biophysical functions in the oceans could collapse. Yet just 2.6% of the ocean has the high level of protection it needs.”

The report found that more than 3 billion people rely on food from the oceans each day, and a healthy ocean contributes $1.5tn to the global economy, as well as absorbing a quarter of carbon dioxide emissions and producing half the world’s oxygen.

A spokesperson for the UK government said: “The UK is at the forefront of the global fight to protect our marine habitats, and is championing a global commitment to protect at least 30% of the global ocean by 2030. We will carefully consider the recommendations made by the High Level Panel, to ensure we continue to work globally to raise the bar for marine protection.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1022,1022,'It can be uncomfortable': how a New York farmhouse is facing its racist past,[],"When people think of buildings in Manhattan, chances are they think big and brash, cloud-piercing skyscrapers for tourists to marvel at.

But the borough is also home to the far more modest Dyckman Farmhouse, a white clapboard home built in 1765. It’s the oldest farmhouse in the city, and just off 204th Street in Inwood, once home to the Dutch farmer William Dyckman, his family and their slaves.

It’s now known as the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum and this fall until next, it’s honoring an overlooked history in an exhibition called Unspoken Voices: Honoring the Legacy of Black America.

It features the artworks of three local artists, all women, who respond to the legacy of the farm and its past with slavery. It’s a way to tell untold stories, says Meredith Horsford, the museum’s executive director.

“Even though we are a historic site, we relate the history to our present day, and that connection is imperative to talk about race,” said Horsford. “It can be uncomfortable, but it still needs to happen.”

Slavery, says Horsford, is a topic that museum visitors are curious about, but cautious. “They think, oh we’re in the north, that wasn’t an issue here,” she says. “From my perspective, working with artists around this is a conversation starter, it’s a topic that is usually difficult to talk about.”

The exhibition, partially funded through the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, all started when Horsford put out a call for artists. Each artist then decided to take a different approach to the theme of slavery, peeling back the layers of history. “People who have been enslaved have been portrayed just as that, but they don’t say much more,” she said.

On the Dyckman Farmhouse, there were roughly seven enslaved people living at the house, shortly after it was built. Records show that Francis Cudjoe was an enslaved man who would later be freed in 1809, and others known only by their first names; Will, Gilbert, Harey and Blossum. A free black woman named Hannah, who was a freed descendant of slaves, worked as a cook for the household.

There was also a burial ground for slaves nearby, known as the Inwood Slave Burial Ground, which contained over 30 slave families (today, it’s a parking lot for a school on 212th Street).

“We wanted to give voice to people and make sure it came across that we’re talking about multi-faceted individuals, people who have their own lives and families when they were put into these horrible situations,” adds Horsford. “We never want to say: ‘these people were just slaves,’ because there’s so much to the story than just that.”

My Soul Sings of Freedom by Gwendolyn Black Photograph: Juan Brizuela

In the exhibition, artist Gwendolyn Black has created life-size figures, which represent some of the farm’s former inhabitants. One represents Hannah, the cook, who stands in the family kitchen as a way to celebrate the legacy and roots of African American cuisine.

“I wanted 3D figures, so people can feel and see them, and we, today’s generations, are human,” said Black. “That’s something that was not felt before. Each of them has fantastic stories to share, so I wanted to be sure that their history will be remembered.”

Black created these figures from mannequins who stand at 5ft 3in tall, masks inspired by African mask-making and each wearing period clothing designed by Wilma Ann Sealy, who used vintage gingham, calico, lace and period-era buttons for each outfit.In the background, the song Like Leaves hums throughout the farmhouse, co-written by Emme Kemp and Milton Polsky, dedicated to former slave Henry Box Brown, and is performed here by Black and Kemp.

“We must learn from history; the good, bad and the ugly, so that we as a society can keep making strides to eradicate systemic racism to ensure everyone can feel free, be free to enjoy life,” said Black. “Not just select people.”

Meanwhile, artist Rachel Sydlowski uses the first floor of the house for an art installation that lets visitors look back through history through UV light. Her artworks are sprawled across the fireplace in the “front parlor”, a leisure room where slaves were forbidden entry. Screen-printed foliage on paper continues behind the desk and before a grandfather clock.

The room is lit by a UV light and features two UV-reactive ersatz candles, which visitors can use as a light source to search for hidden images through the foliage. It lights up information “relating to the lives of the slaves hidden throughout the room”, said Sydlowski. “These images are not visible under the conditions of normal lighting, and this unveiling of information is similar to the act of researching lost histories.”

Sydlowski’s work is accompanied by ceremonial clothing made by Marquise Foster, “created specifically for those who were enslaved”, she said. “The parlor is transformed into a space for recognizing their lives and contributions; I selected this room because it felt like the most powerful one in the farmhouse, a place for ceremony, and reckoning.”

It captures an ongoing battle. “New York City was divided, in regard to slavery, and it was tied to capitalism and the building of wealth in this county,” said Sydlowski. “My installation engages with the difficult truths about the history of slavery at the Dyckman Farmhouse, the city, the country and the lasting effects we are still dealing with today.”

A series of expressive paintings, mixed-media portraits and a video installation are found throughout the farmhouse, created by artist Sheila Prevost, whose work responds to the African Burial Ground national monument in lower Manhattan.

“Highlighting these burial sites increases awareness and understanding of the enslaved history of Africans through institutionalized racism all the way to current times,” said Prevost.

“Today, we are repeatedly confronted with brutality and killing of unarmed black men by law enforcement, and it is essential to recognize the common thread within the narrative of our past and present ideas, behavior and leadership with regards to race and equality,” she adds.

“Following our recent election, we’ve learned how divided the country remains regarding race and equality; many who claim to be extreme pro-life still do not acknowledge that black lives matter.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
702,702,Wisconsin and Arizona certify Biden wins in yet another blow to Trump,[],"Joe Biden’s victories in the US presidential election battlegrounds of Arizona and Wisconsin were officially recognised on Monday, handing Donald Trump six defeats out of six in his bid to stop states certifying their results.

The finalised vote counts took Biden a step closer to the White House and dealt yet another blow to Trump’s longshot efforts to undermine the outcome.

The certification in Wisconsin followed a partial recount that only added to Biden’s nearly 20,700-vote margin over Trump, who has promised to file a lawsuit seeking to undo the results.

“Today I carried out my duty to certify the November 3rd election,” Wisconsin’s governor, Tony Evers, said in a statement. “I want to thank our clerks, election administrators, and poll workers across our state for working tirelessly to ensure we had a safe, fair, and efficient election. Thank you for all your good work.”

Trump is mounting a desperate campaign to overturn the results by disqualifying as many as 238,000 ballots in the state, and his attorneys have alleged without evidence that there was widespread fraud and illegal activity.

Trump paid $3m for recounts in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the two largest Democratic counties in Wisconsin, but the recount ended up increasing Biden’s lead by 74 votes.

Wisconsin’s Democratic attorney general, Josh Kaul, said in a statement on Monday: “There’s no basis at all for any assertion that there was widespread fraud that would have affected the results.”

Kaul noted that Trump’s recount targeted only the state’s two most populous counties, where the majority of Black people live. “I have every confidence that this disgraceful Jim Crow strategy for mass disenfranchisement of voters will fail. An election isn’t a game of gotcha.”

And even if Trump were successful in Wisconsin, where he beat Hillary Clinton four years ago, the state’s 10 electoral college votes would not be enough to undo Biden’s overall victory, as states around the country certify results declaring him the winner.

Trump’s legal challenges have also failed in other battleground states, including Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania. States are required to certify their results before the electoral college meets on 14 December.

Earlier on Monday, Arizona officials certified Biden’s narrow victory in that state. Biden won by about 11,000 votes, a slim margin, although a significant victory nonetheless as in past election cycles Arizona has trended reliably toward Republicans.

The 2020 election is over again, with certifications today in Arizona and Wisconsin. After last week's certifications in Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada. all of the states where Trump has launched spurious claims against the outcome have now certified Biden's victory. — Susan Glasser (@sbg1) November 30, 2020

Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, and Republican governor, Doug Ducey, both vouched for the integrity of the election before signing off on the results.

“We do elections well here in Arizona. The system is strong,” Ducey said.

Hobbs said Arizona voters should know that the election “was conducted with transparency, accuracy and fairness in accordance with Arizona’s laws and election procedures, despite numerous unfounded claims to the contrary”.

Biden is only the second Democrat in 70 years to win Arizona. In the final tally, he beat Trump by 10,457 votes, or 0.3% of the nearly 3.4m ballots cast.

Even as Hobbs, Ducey, the state attorney general and chief justice of the state supreme court certified the election results, Trump’s lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis met in a Phoenix hotel ballroom a few miles away to lay out claims of irregularities in the vote count in Arizona and elsewhere. But they did not provide evidence of widespread fraud.

Trump phoned into the meeting and described the election the “greatest scam ever perpetrated against our country”. When he mentioned Ducey’s name, the crowd booed. He accused the governor of “rushing to sign” papers certifying Democratic wins, adding: “Arizona won’t forget what Ducey just did.”

Trump also berated Ducey on Twitter, asking: “Why is he rushing to put a Democrat in office, especially when so many horrible things concerning voter fraud are being revealed at the hearing going on right now.”

For his part, Ducey, who has previously said his phone’s ringtone for calls from the White House is “Hail to the Chief”, was seen in a viral video clip receiving a call with that ringtone but rejecting it without answering.

Trump’s denials of political reality have left him increasingly isolated as a growing number of Republicans acknowledge the transition and Biden moves ahead with naming appointments to his administration.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In fact, election officials from both political parties have stated publicly that the election went well and international observers confirmed there were no serious irregularities.

Chris Krebs, former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS’s 60 Minutes programme on Sunday: “There is no foreign power that is flipping votes. There’s no domestic actor flipping votes. I did it right. We did it right. This was a secure election.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
443,443,No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs,[],"No horses or peacocks: US limits service animals on planes to dogs

The government has decided that when it comes to air travel, only dogs can be service animals, and non-human companions used for emotional support don’t count.

The transportation department issued a final rule Wednesday that aims to settle years of tension between airlines and passengers who bring their pets on board for free by saying they need them for emotional support.

Not gonna fly: 'emotional support peacock' turned away by airline Read more

For years, the department required airlines to allow animals with passengers who had a doctor’s note saying they needed the animal for emotional support.

Airlines believed passengers abused the rule to bring a menagerie of animals on board including cats, turtles and pigs.

Still, airlines have turned away some animals in the past.

In one case in 2018, a passenger attempted to take her emotional support peacock on a cross-country flight, but the peacock was turned away. Later that year a woman was removed from a plane in Florida after she boarded with her emotional support squirrel.

Perhaps the most distressing case was that of a college student who flushed her emotional support dwarf hamster, Pebbles, down an airport toilet after being told she could not travel.

The transportation department said Wednesday that it was rewriting the rules partly because passengers carrying unusual animals on board “eroded the public trust in legitimate service animals”.

It also cited the increasing frequency of people “fraudulently representing their pets as service animals”, and a rise in misbehavior by emotional-support animals.

The rule will likely prevent Flirty, a miniature service horse, from flying in the passenger cabin in the future. The horse made waves in 2019 after its owner took it on board a flight leaving Chicago.

The new rule will force passengers with emotional-support animals to check them into the cargo hold, and pay a pet fee or leave them at home. The agency estimated airlines will gain up to $59.6m a year in pet fees.

Under the final rule, which takes effect in 30 days, a service animal is a dog trained to help a person with a physical or psychiatric disability.

Advocates for veterans and others had pushed for inclusion of psychiatric service dogs.

Airlines will be able to require owners to vouch for the dog’s health, behavior and training. Airlines can require people with a service dog to turn in paperwork up to 48 hours before a flight, but they can’t bar those travelers from checking in online like other passengers.

Airlines can require that service dogs to be leashed at all times, and they can bar dogs that show aggressive behavior. There have been incidents of emotional-support animals biting passengers.

The transportation department stood by an earlier decision to prohibit airlines from banning entire dog breeds.

That is a setback for Delta Air Lines, which banned “pit bull type dogs” in 2018, a move that was criticized by disability advocates.

Delta, however, is giving no indication of backing down. In a statement, a Delta spokeswoman said the airline is reviewing the new rule but, “At this time, there are no changes to Delta’s current service and support animal policies.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
179,179,No Twitter ‘Fact Check’ Warning on Chinese Official’s Fake Photo of Australian Soldier Beheading Child,['Simon Kent'],"Twitter on Tuesday rejected Canberra’s calls to remove a Beijing official’s gruesome tweet targeting Australian troops, choosing instead to stand with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

As Breitbart News reported, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has demanded Beijing apologize after a top CCP official posted an obviously contrived image on Twitter depicting an Australian soldier with his knife to a child’s throat, appearing to prepare to behead the victim.

Morrison described the post by the official Twitter account of Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian as an “outrageous and disgusting slur” at a virtual news conference in Canberra on Monday.

Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, &call for holding them accountable. pic.twitter.com/GYOaucoL5D — Lijian Zhao 赵立坚 (@zlj517) November 30, 2020

AFP reports Twitter said it had since marked the tweet as “sensitive,” but added comments on topical political issues or “foreign policy sabre-rattling” by official government accounts were generally not in violation of its rules.

Twitter is banned for most citizens in China and Beijing has for decades been accused of widespread human rights abuses.

Some Australian allies expressed concern over the tweet, including New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, with the support coming as Australia looks to strengthen its alliances in the Indo/Pacific region as a guard against Beijing’s increasingly strident diplomacy.

“In this case an image has been used that is not factually correct, that is not a genuine image, so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities,” she told reporters.

The French foreign affairs ministry said the post was “unworthy of the diplomatic standards we have the right to expect from a country like China”.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Canberra dismissed the criticism, instead accusing Australia of making too much of the incident.

“The rage and roar of some Australian politicians and media is nothing but misreading of and overreaction to Mr. Zhao’s tweet,” the spokesperson said.

﻿

The embassy suggested Australian officials were attempting to “deflect public attention from the horrible atrocities by certain Australian soldiers” and “stoke domestic nationalism.”

30,30,A $50m danger-filled restoration,[],"On 21 June 2017, Iraqi forces were nearing the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul. One of the Iraqi city’s most famous and iconic landmarks, the mosque had stood in this part of Mosul – the Old City – since Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zangi, a Turkic ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, oversaw its construction between 1172 and 1173. It was not only a place of worship, but a representation of the city’s rich diversity: of different religions, art, education and culture. The mosque stood strategically placed in the heart of the city, surrounded by a network of tangled walkways and medieval streets that converged towards the city gates.

In July 2014, this mosque was where Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi demanded allegiance in his first and only public appearance. Days earlier he’d declared his caliphate, giving birth to his “Islamic State”.

Three years later, at 21:50 on that June 2017 day – a blink of an eye in its more than 800 years of history – the mosque was destroyed by the jihadist group, yet more devastation in a devastated city. Iraqi forces were fighting to take the mosque in what would be a landmark victory and had reportedly advanced to within 50m of its walls when explosives were detonated from the inside.

The challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri – and with it part of Mosul’s identity – are far greater than a typical restoration

Around the world, news stations looked on as satellite imagery showed rubble strewn across the patch of land where the mosque once stood. “Daesh’s [Islamic State’s] bombing of the al-Hadba minaret and the al-Nuri mosque is a formal declaration of their defeat,” said the then-Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi at the time. But what was left in its place was destruction.

Daesh was forced from the city in July 2017 in what ended a period of warfare known as the battle for Mosul. Then, Mosul’s long recovery began.

The al-Nuri mosque remained in pieces until December 2019 when the campaign to rebuild it was launched, a $50.44m project financed by the United Arab Emirates. The project is one element of a wider Unesco initiative known as Revive the Spirit of Mosul. Launched in February 2018 through a partnership between the Prime Minister of Iraq Mustafa al-Kadhimi and the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the project aims to restore the urban, social and cultural fabric of the Old City, one where late Ottoman buildings stand alongside bustling bazaars and khans (traditional merchants’ dwellings). The Great Mosque of al-Nuri was at the spiritual heart of the Old City, a complex of prayer halls and buildings that spread out over roughly 11,050sq m.

At the mosque’s centre was the al Hadba minaret, a famed tower that looked out across the city. Throughout the years the minaret developed a natural, albeit precarious, lean to one side. This quirk not only gave the city of Mosul the unofficial nickname of “the hunchback” but its image is emblazoned on the 10,000 Iraqi Dinar bank note alongside a portrait of Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham, a Basrah-born mathematician and key figure of the Islamic Golden Age. From the 8th to the 13th Century, this revolutionary era of literature, science, medicine and astronomy made what is modern-day Iraq the intellectual centre of the world.

One of the people heading the Revive the Spirit of Mosul project is Paolo Fontani, who took up the role of Director and Representative of Unesco Iraq in 2019. “When I was asked to take this position, I remember thinking how I would be grateful if one day someone came to help me rebuild my own hometown,” he said. “All the monuments, the places that have marked my existence and constructed who I am. My identity...”

But the challenges of restoring the Great Mosque of al-Nuri – and with it part of Mosul’s identity – are far greater than a typical restoration. Fontani and his team have to contend with a building that is almost 850 years old, and also one that toppled in a warzone.

For work to begin, it was vital to assess what damage had been done. Normally, surveyors would inspect the building and note what needed to be fixed, but there was a problem: the site was far too dangerous for any human to enter. So in the place of humans came drones. These drones, explained Maria Rita Acetoso, senior project officer on the al-Nuri mosque project, surveyed both horizontal surfaces like the roofs of single buildings and vertical ones like a minaret. As they did, a number of geo-referenced photos were taken and pieced together to create a 3D model. This allowed them to effectively fly throughout the wreckage to map every fallen ceiling, and to photograph the 45m-tall minaret in high definition with ease.

After that came stabilising the area, which meant approaching the rubble as a booby-trapped site. Hidden amidst the wreckage, a large arsenal of mines and unexploded devices littered the area. “There were around 300 or 400 cases of TNT under there,” said Acetoso . “There were even IEDs hidden in the walls.”

Securing the site was overseen by the Iraqi authorities, who disarmed each explosive device individually. For Acetoso, this posed the greatest challenge. “The reconstruction of historical landmarks is always challenging, but the de-mining came with an unknown threat,” she said. In collaboration with the Iraqi Ministry of Culture and the State Board of Antiquities, a team of eight archaeologists were able to salvage artworks and artefacts from amongst the rubble that had miraculously survived the blast. In total, 44,000 bricks and 1,100 fragments of marble were recovered from the mosque and its minaret, all of which were catalogued and will eventually decorate the place of worship once again.

Considerable time was spent deciding whether the minaret would be re-erected in its original form – that is, how it looked 850 years ago, or with a tilt, as it was when it was destroyed. The minaret will keep its lean, but the task of rebuilding this plinth is much more difficult than deciding on its aesthetic.

The biggest concern is around the fact that the minaret is the most fragile element of the entire build. When the mosque was destroyed, the explosion caused a partial collapse of the upper base of the minaret’s eastern side, causing the structure to rotate significantly as it fell.

The starting point in salvaging this landmark is by assessing the current strength and stability of what is left, determining what can be saved and what has been lost. This begins by retrieving samples from the existing masonry through endoscopic investigation, where small holes are drilled into the masonry, which are then inspected with a camera. This technique helps inform on everything from the chemical-physical composition of the original materials used and the strength of the bricks themselves, to the exact constructive processes used in the 12th Century or in past renovation attempts. This, says Acetoso, will allow them to rebuild the mosque to near its original form.

The process has been long and arduous. The Covid pandemic has delayed work for most of 2020, and construction won’t fully conclude until 2023. The rebuilding of Mosul doesn’t begin and end with Unesco, however. More than 5,000 buildings were damaged in the Old City alone, while across Mosul, according to original government estimates from 2018, at least $2bn in aid is needed for the city to recover. Mosul itself still suffers with a lack of electricity, internet or provisions.

The site was far too dangerous for any human to enter

“Many families returned to Mosul and saw their own houses, churches, mosques, libraries and museums all destroyed,” said Father Najeeb Michaeel, Christian Chaldean Archbishop of Mosul, who is in the process of rebuilding his St Paul’s church on Mosul’s east side, which remains heavily damaged from the war. “That's why we’re working hand in hand, shoulder by shoulder to clean and rebuild Mosul. Not just in stone, but in spirit.”

The road will be long and difficult, but Mosul’s recovery is not achieved solely through bricks and mortar. It’s achieved in the return of culture to Mosul – of music, arts, education and literature – which is what built the city in the beginning and which is how its future will be drawn.

“They discovered the art of writing and reading here. This is our life. The origin of humanity,” said Father Najeeb. “This is our culture.”

309,309,Fauci Slammed For Finally Admitting Schools Should Be Open,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

Lockdown zealot Dr. Anthony Fauci was slammed this week for finally admitting that schools should have been open despite coronavirus restrictions, with critics charging that children have been subjected to eight months of hell for no good reason.

During a Sunday appearance on ABC’s “This Week”, Fauci stated that “The default position should be to try as best as possible, within reason, to keep the children in school, to get them back to school.”

“Close the bars and keep the schools open,” Dr. Anthony Fauci says, adding that while there is no solution that is “one size fits all,” the “best way to ensure the safety of the children in school is to get the community level of the spread low.” https://t.co/th9oAKhHYa pic.twitter.com/pDuTdQ0Vfp — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 29, 2020

“If you look at the data, the spread among children and from children is not very big at all, not like one would have suspected. So let’s try to get the kids back,” Fauci said.

Senator Rand Paul, who has been consistently pushing for an explanation as to why schools were closed without any scientific backing said that Fauci “owes [an apology] to every single parent and school-age child in America.”

Referring to Fauci’s admission, Paul said “I told him this multiple times this summer.”

Tucker Carlson took Fauci to task Monday, noting that “the country’s public health establishment has tortured your children for eight months for no apparent reason.”

“The authorities have admitted it,” Carlson urged, adding that “the most amazing part — and this really is the headline of the story — is that they knew they were wrong when they did it. But they kept lying about it even as American children began to kill themselves.”

“Why is this just now occurring to Tony Fauci?” Tucker asked, adding “Isn’t this Fauci’s entire job to, quote, ‘look at the data?’ Yes, it is. And, yet, somehow he never thought to do that.”",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the rules of England’s second lockdown, the majority of marriage and civil partnership ceremonies are prohibited. The only weddings allowed to take place are those where one of the couple is seriously ill.

After its 17-day ‘firebreak’ lockdown, weddings in Wales can now go ahead, but the number of ceremony attendees depends on the venue capacity, and receptions are limited to 15 people.

Up to 25 people can attend a wedding ceremony in Northern Ireland, but receptions are banned.

In Scotland, where regions of the country are either in level 1, 2 or 3, no more than 20 people can attend a marriage ceremony or civil partnership.

980,980,BBC turns down Tyson Fury's request to be removed from Spoty shortlist,[],"The BBC Sports Personality of the Year award descended into confusion and then farce on Wednesday after the corporation rejected a demand from the world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury to be the first ever athlete to be taken off its shortlist.

The BBC’s decision came after the controversial fighter took to social media to claim that he didn’t need any “verification” from awards before imploring his supporters not to vote for him. But after several hours of crisis talks the BBC insisted that Fury, who is the third favourite for the award behind the Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and the snooker star Ronnie O’Sullivan, would remain on its six-strong shortlist.

“The shortlist is decided by an independent expert panel who choose contenders based on their sporting achievement in a given year,” a BBC spokesperson said. “On this basis Tyson Fury will remain on the list for SPOTY 2020. As always the winner will be decided by the public voting during the live show and it is of course up to Tyson if he chooses to participate in the show.”

Fury, who was also joined on the shortlist by Stuart Broad, Jordan Henderson and Hollie Doyle, started the controversy earlier on Wednesday with a post on his Instagram account.

“This is a message for bbcsport and their SPOTY award - please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards,” he wrote. “I know who I am and what I’ve done in the sport. I have the love of the people which means more to me than all the awards in the world. To anyone who supports me, don’t vote.”

Fury’s initial inclusion had sparked controversy given he has previously served a two-year doping ban and is under active investigation by the UK Anti-Doping Agency following allegations that a member of Tyson Fury’s team offered a farmer £25,000 to provide a false defence after the heavyweight champion failed a drugs test in 2015.

Hi this is Tyson fury the gypsy king, this is a message for the @bbcsport and there spoty award, please take me off your list as I’m the people’s champion and have no need for verification or any awards. I know who I am & what iv done in sport. I have the love of the people... pic.twitter.com/iwNYblTZG4 — TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 2, 2020

Fury and his cousin Hughie, both blamed their positive tests for nandrolone on eating uncastrated wild boar or ingesting contaminated supplements – citing two statements from the Preston farmer Martin Carefoot saying he had given them the meat in their defence.

However, in March Carefoot changed his story, telling the Mail on Sunday that he provided two false statements after being offered a financial inducement by a member of Fury’s team to lie. Fury’s subsequent promoter, Frank Warren, described the allegations as “total bullshit”.

This is only the second time in the history of the awards that a shortlisted athlete has asked to be removed from the shortlist. In 2015 the Olympic long jump champion Greg Rutherford wrote a private letter to the BBC because he felt uncomfortable being part of the ceremony with Fury – who earlier that year had claimed that “there are only three things that need to be accomplished before Devil comes home. One of them is homosexuality being legal in countries, one of them is abortion and the other is paedophilia.”

Rutherford, whose sister is gay, was eventually persuaded to take part in the ceremony after his letter was leaked. But in his autobiography he admitted he wished he hadn’t changed his mind. “I didn’t enjoy it one bit,” he wrote. “I turned up late and left as soon as I possibly could.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
722,722,Covid has shown me what lies beyond boredom: post-boredom,[],"I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. “Good, thanks. You?” I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. “What did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn’t it?”

At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. “Let’s see, umm … got really into jigsaws for a bit. Rearranged the spare room into an office. Learned to make this one really good curry recipe from the BBC website. Uh … got 11 solo wins and about 24 duo wins on Fortnite.” Is that good?, they’ll ask, and I’ll have to admit that no, not particularly. “It’s a game for 12-year-olds that I play compulsively,” I’ll explain. “Every day I log in and let adolescents embarrass me in an online world that allows them to dance joyously on the remains of my corpse.” Oh, they’ll say. I think there’s something – I think there’s something happening in the other room. I really ought to…

I think it’s important to address the fact that I am bored. I am, to my bones, bored of this. I know that in the current climate, being bored is a high luxury, but it doesn’t make it any more thrilling. In fact, I am so deep into boredom that I have burrowed beneath the previously accepted boundaries of the concept, and have now emerged, apathetically, into post-boredom.

I never thought this would happen: if you had offered me, at the start of the year, the chance to sit inside for eight months chain-watching Netflix and not really going out or doing anything, and told me that being glued to my sofa would be reframed from a “sign of a life falling apart” to something I was doing “for the moral good of the country and the world as a whole”, I would have bitten your hand off for it.

I excel in inactivity. A squalid little part of me always imagined that I’d thrive in the ambient boredom of prison – not the gangs part of prison, or the crapping in a room with someone watching you part, or the shanking someone for some cigarette bit, or getting a pool cue cracked over me, but I really think I’d get some good letter-writing done. Lockdown has offered all the perks of prison (time) and none of the cons (prison), and yet what have I done with it? Watched part, but somehow still not all, of The Sopranos. That’s not really good enough.

This boredom is dangerous, because I’m not the only one experiencing it. Humans can only live in fear for so long, and I think, for a lot of us, being high-key scared of coronavirus wore off some time around June. Second lockdown has been a poor impersonation of the first one – no clapping, no supermarket queues, no Houseparty, The Undoing – but we wore through our boredom reserves and gnawed at the core of the human condition.

Though I think it’s psychologically ungreat for the biggest health threat of my lifetime to be reduced to a background hum of danger, an unseen force that just makes me swerve people in the corridors of my block of flats as I go downstairs for the post and not much else, it’s possibly even worse that we’ve worn boredom down to the bone. If we’ve worked through fear, and worked our way through boredom, what, really, is there left? Speaking only for myself – someone who mildly considered buying prescription orange-tinted glasses this week just to feel something – the answer can only be “chaos”.

Christmas is coming, and once that is done we might well be facing a threat of Lockdown 3.0. A third lockdown in the most miserable month of the year won’t be difficult for those of us who have adapted to the beige rigours of not really doing very much – stay indoors, pick yet another box set, even if the prospect of yet another minute-and-a-half-long opening sequence fills you with dread.

But, beyond that, it’s hard to know where the bored-of-boredom will end. We’re all tiptoeing around the idea that “normal” doesn’t exist any more, and whatever tattered social landscape greets us once this entire pandemic is lifted will be practically unrecognisable (and far, far worse) than what we were used to in the old days. But what will we do in a post-boredom economy? What will we do when traditional acts of rest and relaxation inspire juddering flashbacks to lockdown? It’s hard to know what anything in the world will look like come 2021, but I’m certain that boredom will look different to us for the rest of our natural lives.

1114,1114,Hurry Up! The First 100 OGE Attendees To Stop By The Nintendo Booth Today Will Get A Free Sample Of What Pikmin Taste Like,[],"With thousands flocking through the doors at the Zweibel Convention Center to attend our first-ever Onion Gamer Expo, some of the best swag is going and going fast. But we’re about to give you an inside scoop on one of the coolest offers of the whole conference: The first 100 OGE attendees to stop by the Nintendo Booth today will get a free sample of what Pikmin really taste like!

Hurry up! This is a deal that’s too good to miss!

We’re talking Red, Yellow, Blue, Purple, White, Rock and Flying Pikmin, sliced up and ready for your enjoyment! So drop whatever you’re doing and come on by the Nintendo Gaming Experience to get an absolutely free, no-questions-asked sample. And if you’re worried about trying such an exotic cut of meat, don’t worry! These are flame-grilled, beautifully seasoned, and butchered into perfectly bite-sized cubes, so you won’t even imagine a Pikmin’s cute little face while you’re chowing down.

Admittedly, there’s a certain crunch to the Pikmin meat that might be a bit unnerving if this is your first time. That’s from their tiny bones and inner tendons, which aren’t removed in most traditional preparations. After you understand that, you’ll realize those crunchier and chewier components actually lend a nice textural component. And the meat’s flavor? It has this sweet and savory mix that you’ve got to experience for yourself to believe.

If you want to get really adventurous, there are also a few Bulbmin samples, too. But watch out! One out of every hundred preparations is supposed to be poisonous.

As an added incentive, the Nintendo employees are also providing wine pairings for the first 50 attendees. That really helps wash down the gamier taste of these half-plant, half-animal bites. They’re also offering complimentary silk cloth s to cover your face if you want to avoid offending G od with this culinary trespass against the laws of nature. Just remember, they’re flying off the sample tray, so get on over here for your own bite of these little critters as soon as you can!",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
353,353,The Blue Danube River Cruise - MS Robert Burns,[],"Day

6

For many, today’s visit to Vienna will be one of the highlights of the cruise. The city’s very name provokes images of elegance, fine music, wide boulevards, Baroque architecture and a rich tapestry of peoples who were drawn here from all corners of Europe. For 200 years until the First World War, Vienna was the cultural centre of Europe and many of the showpiece buildings, galleries, aristocratic palaces and magnificent churches you see today were built to reflect its imperial status. The city’s most iconic monument is the breathtaking Saint Stephen’s Cathedral, whose striking multi-coloured roof and huge Gothic South Tower dominate the skyline. There’s also the colossal Hofburg, the former royal court that is now home to a collection of museums, the Crown Jewels and the Spanish Riding School, and where the Vienna Boys’ Choir performs. Then there are the lavish Imperial Apartments and an outstanding collection of relics of the Holy Roman Empire, including, allegedly, the sabre of Charlemagne himself. The Kunsthistorisches Museum, which contains the world’s fourth largest collection of paintings, is just across the road. This morning we have a tour with a local guide offering insights into why Vienna is one of Europe’s great capitals – the seat of the Habsburg emperors and home to some of the world’s finest classical composers, including Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart and, of course, a whole family of Strausses. During the afternoon you’re free to explore as you wish. Take a stroll in the Prater, notable for the huge Ferris wheel that features in several Cold War spy thrillers. Or, for something quite different, visit the Schönbrunn Palace, a former royal residence now housing a range of world-class museums and galleries. Perhaps, though, just take a stroll through Vienna’s atmospheric side streets, or enjoy a coffee and a slice of delicious Sachertorte in one of the lovely coffee houses. This evening we’ve arranged truly the ‘icing on the cake’: no visit to Vienna is complete without a live musical experience, so after dinner we have a classical recital on board. To hear this exquisite music played in the city of its creation makes a wonderful finale to the day.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

649,649,‘The holy grail of packaging recycling’: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there’s one thing the British public likes to complain about, it’s recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn’t, where it ends up and who’s paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn’t always straightforward. “Sometimes it’s really hard to identify what kind of material it is,” says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. “If the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it’s covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,” he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it’s vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies – essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‘The objective is to increase farmer incomes’: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer’s bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. “This means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,” says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it’s a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. “It makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today’s problems in sorting and recycling packaging,” says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. “[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.”

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product’s website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. “Maybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],” he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. “We are in a very early pioneering phase,” he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. “Even with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,” she says. “The results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.”

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold’s mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. “It brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,” he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. “This means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.”

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. “One of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,” she says. “The HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it’s time to take this testing to the next level.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

629,629,Israel moves towards fourth election with dissolution vote,[],"Parliament passes preliminary bill to dissolve itself in move seen as gambit by Benny Gantz to pass budget

Israel’s parliament has passed a preliminary bill to dissolve itself, a move that threatens to break apart an already fractured coalition government and trigger a fourth election in less than two years.

Wednesday’s vote, which is not final and requires further readings, was largely seen as a gambit by Benny Gantz, the former head of the opposition who reluctantly joined Benjamin Netanyahu’s coalition this year to assert his authority.

The bill passed 61 to 54, with the potential for further legislation to formally dissolve the house as soon as next week, which would lead to an election in the spring. Gantz’s Blue and White party pushed through Wednesday’s bill with support from smaller opposition parties.

In a televised speech on Tuesday night, Gantz, who serves as defence minister, accused the country’s longest-serving leader of lying and sidelining his demands, in particular, a proposed budget.

“Netanyahu likes to compare us to the most progressive and successful countries in the world,” Gantz said. “Show me one other country where a prime minister sabotages his own country’s budget.”

However, he added elections could be avoided if the prime minister agreed to the budget. He said: “Netanyahu, the burden of proof is on you.”

Shortly before Gantz spoke, Netanyahu released a video on Twitter speaking out against the move. “Now is not the time for elections,” Netanyahu said. “Now is the time for unity.”

Negotiations between Blue and White and Netanyahu’s ruling Likud party are expected to continue in the coming days in the hopes of avoiding a costly election.

Under the terms of the coalition government formed in May, Netanyahu serves as prime minister for the first 18 months, after which Gantz will take the leadership role for the remainder of a three-year term.

By agreeing to that deal, Gantz, who entered politics primarily on the promise to oust Netanyahu, disappointed his voters and his own party, which broke apart into factions. Gantz said he acted to end a political crisis during a pandemic after three back-to-back elections failed to produce a clear winner, and that he intended to work with Netanyahu.

“I was well aware of his track record as a ‘serial promise-breaker’, but I thought that the people of Israel are more important than one leader, and that Netanyahu would rise to the occasion. Much to my dismay, that didn’t happen,” Gantz said on Tuesday.

“Netanyahu didn’t lie to me – he lied to all of you.”

For Netanyahu, the unity deal was largely seen as a career-saver, and possibly a chance for him to skirt his legal woes. The 71-year-old politician is a deeply divisive figure and faces three damning criminal corruption cases on charges he denies.

“Netanyahu is on a path of personal survival. The only index for his decision-making is relevance to his ability to evade trial, which is just around the corner,” Gantz said, in reference to hearings next year.

Opposition voices in Israel have said Netanyahu never intended to rotate the prime minister position to Gantz, and prefers to fight another round of elections that could give him a more stable government.

“[Blue and White] was the victim of the most sophisticated political sting operation ever, managed by a first-class, master swindler,” wrote Yossi Verter in Haaretz, a paper deeply critical of the prime minister.

“The prime minister’s ultimate goal is to evade trial. Either by legislation, or by appointing an attorney general who will delay the proceedings, or by any other way his partners in the next coalition will make available.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

640,640,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‘one of the greatest challenges of our time’ and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called “one of the greatest challenges of our time”.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised “the devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire”.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the “alarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity” including the decline in New Zealand’s indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and Māori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must “act with urgency”.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

“This declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,” she said.

“It is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.”

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service’s buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the “significant progress on meeting the challenge” by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation – which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 – made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was “embarrassing” and had become “untenable”, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. “The irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.”

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

New Zealand experiences warmest winter on record Read more

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: “[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.”

Wednesday’s declaration also said the government will “demonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government’s own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025”.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it “virtue signalling”.

“We think it’s all very well to declare an emergency but there’s no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,” Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government’s fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation’s biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand’s pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
116,116,Fitton: Election Update,['Tom Fitton'],"If you want to effectively express your beliefs about this deliberately chaotic election, I urge you to contact your representatives in your state legislature and Congress. Especially if you live in Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Nevada, and Arizona – cesspools of fraud and lawlessness all.

I described what we’re witnessing in an interview with Stephanie Hamill on One America News Network:

Americans see an election that’s been questioned because of substantial allegations of maladministration of the election – that’s a charitable interpretation of it. And they know there’s an air of violence and censorship and suppression if they dare raise questions about it or support the president. We who are defending the rule of law are being lectured about the peaceful transfer of power by the likes of President Obama, who during his transition was actually conspiring against President Trump and spying on his team illicitly.

In her Newsmax television show Sovereign Nation, Michelle Malkin complimented Judicial Watch for our work on elections and suggested that we have earned the right to say, “I told you so.” I take no comfort in that because we have unprecedented fraud occurring across the country.

Michelle asked me what Judicial Watch doing about it. My response:

Our litigators and investigators are figuring out where we can make a stand to preserve the lawful election result. U.S. Code designates this past Tuesday as Election Day. That’s when we’re supposed to select the president. Any votes being counted that arrive after that day should be subject to challenge. And any vote counting that occurs after Election Day should be subject to challenge. When you have a pause in counting, that indicates that fraud has taken place.

This is what I said to my Twitter followers about our activity:

Americans should demand courts and state legislatures and Congress protect free and fair elections! Judicial Watch is conducting independent investigations in PA, GA, AZ, NV, MI, WI!

We don’t know how all of this will play out. The election may well end up in Congress, as I explain in this video:

The electors vote as part of the Electoral College process in the middle of December. Then on January 6, the new Congress is supposed to meet and count the votes and essentially confirm and ratify the Electoral College selection of the president and vice president. Now, if there’s a challenge, you could get a situation where the House, for instance, wants to bless the Biden electors out of Pennsylvania and the Senate wants to reject them. Frankly, I’m not sure what happens next.

We have observed and researched and litigated elections for decades, and, as you might imagine, we are following this one extremely closely. We will be deploying our weapon of choice, the Freedom of Information Act, to uncover the truth.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
104,104,VIDEO: Trump Supporters Rally Outside GA Secretary of State's Home,['Amy Furr'],"About 200 of President Donald Trump’s supporters rallied outside Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger’s (R) Atlanta home on Saturday to protest the election results.

“Trucks flying Trump and ‘Stop the Steal’ flags drove up and down the street outside of Secretary Brad Raffensperger’s property, honking their horns as they passed by,” Fox 5 reported.

Organizer Ursula Christie told the outlet she wanted Raffensperger to know “we are silent no more and we want him to know that we are watching and we are listening and we are aware of the actions being taken.”

Raffensperger, a Republican, said he voted for Trump but has received criticism for his handling of the election.

“On Thanksgiving Day, Trump called Georgia’s election was [sic] part of a ‘fraudulent system’ and said Raffensperger was an ‘enemy of the people,'” the Fox 5 report continued.

During an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on November 18, Raffensperger dismissed allegations of voter fraud in his state but acknowledged the possibility of clerical errors:

We have not seen any widespread voter fraud. The president has picked up some votes in a few of the counties that made some clerical errors. It wasn’t the machines. But at the end of the day, he started with 14,000. He’s about 12,000 now. But we’re finishing up, waiting for a few more counties to get back to us, large counties, but I don’t believe at the end of the day it will change the total results.

When asked if he believed former Vice President Joe Biden would win Georgia, Raffensperger said “Yes, I believe that’s the way it will turn out.”

However, in a Friday tweet, Trump said “Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous ‘80,000,000 votes’ were not fraudulently or illegally obtained.”

“When you see what happened in Detroit, Atlanta, Philadelphia & Milwaukee, massive voter fraud, he’s got a big unsolvable problem!” he concluded.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
269,269,Drug Company Counter-Sues COVID Vaccine Trial Volunteer for ‘Malicious’ Claim Injection Led to Health Issues,[],"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.

Keep up to date with our latest:

The Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has gone on the offensive after a participant in its coronavirus vaccine trial sued the firm, alleging he suffered serious side effects from the jab.

In a countersuit, SII has demanded Rs 100 crore ($13.5 million USD) from the volunteer for his “malicious and misconceived” allegation that Covishield, a version of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University Covid-19 jab, led to a medical episode.

In a statement, the company said it was “sympathetic with the volunteer’s medical condition” but that there is “absolutely no correlation with the vaccine trial and the medical condition of the volunteer.” The Pune-based drug manufacturer stressed that the volunteer was “specifically informed by the medical team that the complications he suffered were independent of the vaccine trial he underwent,” but the individual “still chose to go public and malign the reputation” of SII.

The volunteer, a 40-year-old man from Chennai, claims he suffered severe neurological damage after taking part in the phase three trial of Covishield. He sued SII for Rs 5 crore ($676,000 USD) and demanded SII, AstraZeneca and the Oxford Vaccine Group immediately halt vaccine trials, involving some 1,600 volunteers.

The man reportedly suffered from headaches and vomiting ten days after receiving the jab. He was taken to the hospital after displaying abnormal behavior.

The trial participant was later discharged at his own request. Hospital documents stated he was recovering from “acute encephalopathy,” was suffering from vitamin deficiencies and was suspected of having a “connective tissue disorder.”

A medical official cited by local media said that the man was “now alright” and did not incur any expenses for his time in the emergency ward. The man’s wife claims he has not fully recovered.

In September, SII halted its clinical trials of Covishield after a recipient of the AstraZeneca jab experienced adverse symptoms.

The lawsuit and countersuit come as SII prepares to apply for emergency authorization to distribute and administer Covishield around India.",InfoWars,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
719,719,"When it comes to politics, teenagers can teach the experts a thing or two",[],"It is widely thought that everything used to be better in our day, whoever “our” is and whenever that “day” might have been. This is generally rubbish, obviously. Take A-levels: even if maybe they were harder back in the day, so what? They are a lot more interesting now. I am especially envious of those studying politics at A-level. It sounds so fascinating, relevant and necessary. My daughter is one of them. One morning, I asked her what they would be looking at in class and she said: “Oh God, we’re doing anarchism at the moment – it’s so boring.” How can anarchism, of all things, be boring? Perhaps she had chanced on anarchism’s central flaw: all that abolishing-government carry-on is not as exciting as it sounds. Newsflash: anarchism is boring; there’s a T-shirt slogan there, I’m sure.

Generally, though, she is fascinated by the subject. I love that, because it has given me the opportunity to share with her all the political knowledge I have accumulated over the past half century. How deeply the child drinks from the fount of her father’s wisdom. Or perhaps not. Only this weekend, as we engaged in research, watching that historical drama The Crown, I posited the idea that Margaret Thatcher was not hung up about being lower middle class. “Of course she wasn’t,” my daughter eye-rolled in an everyone-knows-that kind of way. Just to take the evening’s source material even more highbrow than The Crown, I started her on The West Wing, from the very beginning.

Somewhat inspired by my daughter’s adventures in this field, we have started recruiting A-level politics students on to the politics show I do on BBC Radio 5 live. Each Thursday, on Question Time Extra Time, one of them comes on alongside the pundits and assorted clever clogs. Professionally, it has been one of the more rewarding experiences I have had this year. More than once, the grownups in the room have had to acknowledge that the student is putting us to shame.

I knew it would be good when our first one popped up to join us: Ryan from Barton Peveril sixth form college in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

“How are you doing, Ryan?”

“Living the dream,” he said happily. “Living the dream.”

I rejoice in the cheerful, cheeky confidence of youth. And the intelligence, curiosity and humility, too. Ryan told me he was a passionate socialist and advocate of social justice, so he knew what he believed in, but chose to study politics because he wanted to expose himself “to the differing views and ideologies of people my age who are politically active”. What? No echo chamber? There must be something wrong with the lad. Just so you know, I have a keen ear for BS: I know when someone is trotting out something they have worked out will sound good, and when they really mean it. This was the latter.

Interestingly, Ryan also spoke of a “misconception that young people are more liberal and more leftwing. There’s definitely a variety of views. Sometimes, I do find it hard to find reason within the ideologies; we’ve got a few Thatcherites in our class.”

Thatcherites? Good heavens! By my reckoning, his classmates weren’t born until 13 years after she was dethroned.

I was charmed, too, by the only student we have had on from a private school: Gen, from St Helen & St Katharine school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Why politics? “Well, it’s everything, isn’t it? I love it. My lessons are never, ever boring. Every week we talk not just about the syllabus, but about how it applies to the news that week.” Sounds good to me.

As for the political drift of her classmates at this £17,000-a-year establishment, she said: “There were a few hardcore Tories, but I like to think I’ve pulled them towards the Liberal Democrats at least, or even Green.” No mention of Labour here, you will note, but there you go. As for the obvious, arguably cheap-shot question of how she feels about the millions of students in state schools who had not had all the online tuition she had enjoyed so much this year, she just said: “I feel awful.” There is not a lot you can come back with there.

Ewan, from Pembrokeshire college in Haverfordwest, was another impressive character. He said his earliest memory of politics was Barack Obama’s inauguration speech in 2009. Wow, that’s quite a start. “Things have deteriorated quite significantly since then,” he said sadly.

He went on to praise his teacher: “It’s brilliant the way she brings in different views in the classroom. I think a lot of people would fear the teacher would disagree with them and see them differently, but it’s never like that.”

This rather flies in the face of fears that politics teachers may be imposing their views on students. I am sure that goes on, but I can’t bring myself to worry about it much. What we could choose to worry about instead is how the appreciation of the complexities of policy matters that A-level students gain will probably drain away as the chill wind of “real” politics blows through. Molly, from Woodhouse sixth-form college in Barnet, north London, said she found it “interesting to see how different people think and how different people believe in different policies. Everyone has an opinion that can be taken into consideration; everything is on the table.”

If only the real world were like that; as we all know, the only thing on the table tends to be your own view – or those of your tribe – and everyone else is either stupid or evil. Also on the same show as Molly was the political strategist Salma Shah, who confessed to a mere B grade in A-level politics. We had been talking earlier about the need for more clarity in government messaging. But then 17-year-old Molly said her A-level had taught her: “Nothing in global politics is black and white; everything is complicated.”

Salma and I had to break it to her, only partly in jest, that this kind of nuanced, non-binary thinking will get you nowhere in politics. Discuss. Now, there is a half-decent essay question.

942,942,Hungary's rightwing rulers downplay MEP 'gay orgy' scandal amid hypocrisy accusations,[],"Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, has condemned the behaviour of MEP József Szájer, from his rightwing Fidesz party, after Szájer’s participation in a “gay orgy” in Brussels prompted accusations of hypocrisy.

“What our representative, József Szájer, did has no place in the values of our political family. We will not forget nor repudiate his 30 years of work, but his deed is unacceptable and indefensible,” said Orbán on Wednesday evening. He said Szájer had left the party. He had already resigned as an MEP over the weekend.

Orbán’s government has enacted a range of legislation over the past decade infringing on LGBT rights, and Szájer boasted of personally rewriting Hungary’s constitution to define marriage as a heterosexual institution in 2011.

That made it all the more embarrassing when he was caught by Brussels police shinning down a drainpipe to escape a gay orgy last Friday. Police raided the gathering as it violated Belgium’s coronavirus regulations.

In a terse statement, the Fidesz grouping in the European parliament commended Szájer’s resignation. “He made the only right decision. We acknowledge his decision, just as we acknowledge that he has apologised to his family, his political community and to the voters,” it read.

Prior to Orbán’s intervention, Hungarian ministers were tight-lipped when questioned by a reporter from the outlet Telex on Wednesday morning as they arrived for a cabinet meeting at a government building.

“Mr Szájer made the only possible right decision, and all the rest is his personal matter,” said the justice minister, Judit Varga. Other ministers ignored questions. A police cordon was set up to prevent the journalist from questioning any further officials.

Szájer, who is married, resigned unexpectedly on Sunday, without giving any reason. He made a statement on Tuesday when media reports about the orgy began to circulate. According to the Brussels region’s deputy public prosecutor, he was arrested with bloodied hands after a passerby spotted him “fleeing along the gutter” to escape the raid.

Szájer admitted he had been at a “house party” but said the drugs the police found on him were planted. He apologised to his family, but made no reference to the nature of the party. One person who knew Szájer said while the politician never discussed his sexuality, it was considered an “open secret” among Fidesz circles.

David Manzheley, the organiser of the party, told Belgian newspaper HLN that Szájer had come to the party as the plus-one of another guest. “I always invite a few friends to my parties, who in turn bring some friends along, and then we make it fun together. We talk a bit, we drink something – just like in a cafe. The only difference is that in the meantime we also have sex with each other,” he said. He added that guests had been “completely naked” at the time of the raid.

Belgian police have opened a case against those present for violating lockdown rules, as well as against Szájer for possession of drugs. But the “gay orgy” element is the one receiving the most attention, mainly because Szájer has played a key role as part of a rightwing government that has enacted numerous pieces of anti-LGBT legislation.

In 2011, Szájer boasted that he had drafted Hungary’s new constitution on his iPad, including a clause that explicitly defined marriage as between a man and a woman. He dismissed a question from a journalist who asked how he could refer to it as “a 21st-century constitution” when it did not guarantee LGBT rights.

Szájer said: “It depends how we interpret the 21st century. I don’t think that the traditional concept of marriage has changed just because we came into another millennium.”

In the intervening decade, Orbán’s government has gone further in its “traditional values” drive. Last year, senior Fidesz figures called for a boycott of Coca-Cola after it used gay couples in a Hungarian advertising campaign, while the country announced late last year it would not participate in the Eurovision song contest, with sources saying the contest was deemed “too gay” for conservative government and public media bosses.

Last month, as Hungary struggled amid surging coronavirus cases, Orbán’s government introduced a new set of constitutional amendments to parliament, including one that stipulates that, in a parent-child relationship, “the mother is a woman and the father is a man”. It also said that only heterosexual married couples could adopt children, with even single people requiring special ministerial dispensation.

The government’s justification for the amendment explained that “new, modern ideologies in the western world raise doubt about the creation of the male and female sex, and endanger the right of children to have healthy development”.

Opposition parties seized on the scandal as evidence of Fidesz hypocrisy, but leading government figures appear to have decided the best policy is to remove Szájer from the political spotlight and hope the scandal blows over.

In a programme on the pro-government Pesti TV, host Zsolt Jeszenszky criticised liberals for making “a huge political deal out of a sex scandal” and praised Szájer’s statement of apology. He also insinuated, as did many other pro-government commentators, that the scandal or arrest could have been a setup by unnamed enemies of Hungary’s government.

644,644,Laura Davis: the 10 funniest things I have ever seen (on the internet),[],"Hello, I’m Laura Davis. I’m an Australian comedian who normally lives in London, but I’ve ended up unexpectedly trapped in New Zealand this year on my way back to Australia. Well, as much as you can be trapped in one of the safest places in the world.

I’ve spent most of 2020 walking around in the woods alone in the day, and scrolling through the internet to check the rest of the world is still there at night. It’s been nice but I am probably getting a bit of a Jack Torrance vibe.

London and New Zealand are great, don’t get me wrong, but I haven’t been home to Australia in years and by now I’m homesick enough that I’d probably fall to my knees at the mere waft of a sausage. In the spirit of patriotism, I’ve quarantined this list to the Aussie corner of the internet. (Full disclosure, these internet people are all my real-life friends, but at the moment this is the only way I get to see them too.)

1) This sketch from Mad as Hell that I wish was for a real show

‘This country is facing an existential crisis.’

Writing on Mad As Hell was one of the best jobs I’ve ever gotten to do and I miss working with the team and cast. I’ve really loved watching how they tackled 2020 restrictions and I’m extremely glad that they were allowed to keep producing the show this year. This was one of my favourites last season and I think it really shows off the ensemble so well.

2) This intro clip for MAGMA

Engineering numbers.

Speaking of Mad As Hell, Alasdair Tremblay-Birchall and Andy Matthews are two of the best sketch writers I’ve ever gotten to work with. This is the intro clip for their show MAGMA, which you can go and watch on demand here https://sospresents.com/ along with other incredible Australian comedians like Double Denim and Jude Perl.

3) This perfect gala set from Steph Tisdell (language warning!)

‘I will just warn you before I go any further ...’

As a comic it’s hard to sum yourself up in a four-minute gala set but Steph really nails it here. She’s just so good.

4) Steve Irwin being bitten by a snake three seconds after he says it won’t bite

‘The only reason I’m doing this is because this one’s a python ...’

The only not-stand-up clip that I’ve included. The snake has impressive comic timing considering it’s a snake. Steve Irwin is such a gentleman with beautiful manners. Take a moment to appreciate the dedication of the puppeteer and the host’s brave gaze. I don’t know what else you could want.

5) Danielle Walker’s joke about her grandad’s grave

‘He calls it his man grave.’

Probably one of the bits I try and retell badly to people the most. Sorry for butchering it at dinner parties, Danielle.

6) This clip from Kirsty Webeck

‘I had a little nibble.’

Kirsty has such a delightful energy. This clip was a nice surprise 2020 treat the other week when it came through my feed.

7) Alice Fraser

‘A bit testerical are we?’

Alice has a plethora of amazing comedy available online, but this is a great intro if you haven’t seen her work before. The punchline count in this four and a half minutes is genuinely incredible.

8) Jude Perl’s Hungry and Horny

‘Proudly brought to you by ...’

Jude is just plain talented. If I’m ever having a bad day I put on her albums for an instant boost.

9) Jack Druce – just Jack Druce in general

‘Say what you will about a single bed ...’

Jack is the most unique joke writer I can think of and I really love his work. It was pretty hard to select my favourite clip so I really recommend watching the full show on his channel. He’s also got a great newsletter that you can’t see on the internet unless you sign up for it here.

We’re feeling pretty annoyed right now because we just walked into the OGN offices after taking the weekend off and we were met with a nasty surprise: W e forgot to drain our new Xbox Series X over the weekend, and now all the game fluid leaked out.

Ugh, this sucks.

Obviously, the manual says to drain your Series X every six to eight hours with the included syringe, but we just completely neglected to head into work a few times to open up the excess valve and make sure the video game runoff didn’t gunk up the works. It really spilled everywhere— the whole outside of the console is green with congealed gaming fluid, the fluid valve has shattered from excess pressure, and it looks like a fair amount of the stuff even dripped down the table and seeped into the carpet.

This is a major drag, and it’s made all the worse by the fact that we have no one to blame but ourselves. We even remember thinking on Friday, “Hmm, it’s been a while since anyone drained the Xbox, and we’ve been going pretty hard on Demon’s Souls lately, so we probably need to soon.” On the other hand, it was the end of the day and we didn’t want to have to walk all the way to the bathroom to flush it down the toilet. Oh well, we suppose hindsight is 20/20.

Oh, crap. Now that we’ve been standing in here for a little while, it’s really clear that the distinctive bitter gaming fluid smell has seeped into most of the fabric, too. God, it’s really noxious. Maybe it would help if we open a window or something.

We guess this is just one of those things that happens to you once and then you learn your lesson. Suffice it to say, we won’t leave the office again without double-checking each and every one of our Xboxes to en sure the gaming fluid dial is at 50% or lower. Honestly, at this point, this whole thing has been such a headache, so we’re thinking about maybe even investing in one of those automatic fluid changers that they sell on Hammacher Schlemmer.

Okay, gamers, well we’re going to grab some Lysol and paper towels and try to dab out some of it out of the drapes, but honestly, we don’t know if it’s going to require a professional cleaning or what. Yuck. What a morning.",TheOnion,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,

859,859,Microsoft apologises for feature criticised as workplace surveillance,[],"Microsoft has apologised for enabling a feature, “productivity score”, which critics said was tantamount to workplace surveillance.

The company says it will now make changes to the service, which lets IT administrators “help their people get the most” from its products, in order to limit the amount of information about individual employees that is shared with managers.

“At Microsoft, we believe that data-driven insights are crucial to empowering people and organisations to achieve more,” Jared Spataro, the corporate vice president for Microsoft 365, said in a statement. “We also believe that privacy is a human right, and we’re deeply committed to the privacy of every person who uses our products.”

The core use-case of the productivity score service is at an organisational level: administrators can use it to see technical information about their network, and also to understand how employees are using features such as chatrooms and scheduling tools.

But that information could also be seen on a user-by-user basis, potentially allowing managers to identify individual employees who weren’t contributing enough, or using tools in the right way.

Now, Microsoft says, it will removing individual user names from the productivity score entirely. “Going forward, the communications, meetings, content collaboration, teamwork and mobility measures in productivity score will only aggregate data at the organisation level – providing a clear measure of organisation-level adoption of key features,” Spataro says. “No one in the organisation will be able to use productivity score to access data about how an individual user is using apps and services in Microsoft 365.”

The company is also changing its branding around the feature to make clear that the “productivity” that is being scored is that of organisations, not individuals. “Productivity score produces a score for the organisation and was never designed to score individual users,” Spataro adds.

Jeffrey Snover, a veteran Microsoft engineer and CTO of the company’s “modern workforce transformation” unit, praised the change and thanked Wolfie Christl, the Austrian privacy activist who first raised alarm about the feature, for the feedback.

“The thing I love most about Microsoft is that when we screw up, we acknowledge the error and fix it,” Snover tweeted. “10,000 thanks to Wolfie Christl and others for the feedback which led to this change!”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
654,654,The mental health MOT: how to check if your pandemic blues are a cause for concern,[],"It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she’d taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. “And then the next morning, I just went: ‘No, that’s it, I’m going out.’” She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. “It’s at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,” she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.

Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, A Sonic Hug. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself – making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.

“I started to get those feelings last week,” she says. “There’s a terrible uneasiness. There’s this nervous energy, your thoughts are darting about considerably and you can’t concentrate on one thing. I get extremely irritable and overwhelmed by everything and there’s a feeling of complete hopelessness.” There are physical sensations, too – her heart races, and she feels hot. “And just a detachment from reality, and becoming quite paranoid about things.” Although it’s tough to experience, it is, she says, “a godsend that I know what’s happening now”.

For those of us not so in tune with signals that our mental health is suffering, it can be hard at the moment to know if something is becoming a problem. In this pandemic year, says Ann Robinson, a GP and writer, “the usual signs of depression and anxiety are muddled and difficult to tease out”. Symptoms are different because of the effect the pandemic is having on our daily lives. Many of us are experiencing signs of depression or anxiety to some extent, but, Robinson points out, “we’re not all necessarily clinically depressed or anxious”.

Experts have predicted a mental health crisis this winter, and the Centre for Mental Health, an independent UK charity, predicts that in England up to 10 million people will need support as a result of the Covid crisis. Although we should be wary of diagnosing ourselves or others with mental health disorders, we can watch out for signs. The problem is it can be difficult when we’re not around the people who might spot something is off – our family, friends or colleagues – and it can be hard to know what is a cause for concern, and what is an entirely understandable response to unprecedented times.

“For instance, if you are feeling very sad,” says Robinson, “you would normally measure that by saying you have no plans, that you’re not looking forward to anything in the future. That’s quite rational at the moment. In fact, you could say it was irrational to be making too many plans.” Instead, says Robinson, “ask yourself whether the things that usually lift your spirits, like a walk in the park, or chucking a stick for your dog, are failing to”.

Another sign of depression may be feeling confused or being unable to concentrate. “Normally, you might judge that by asking yourself if you can focus at work,” she says. “But everyone’s finding it hard to focus on Zoom now. So perhaps a better measure now is: can you stick with the plot of a book? Can you follow a TV drama? Or do you find that you just can’t concentrate because of the intrusive and negative thoughts?”

Excessive fear or worry is a sign of an anxiety issue, but again, says Robinson, we’re living with scary news and who is to say what is excessive? “So ask yourself: is it becoming overwhelming, is it constant and is it a greater fear level than other people seem to be experiencing?” Another sign of depression and anxiety is a withdrawal from friends and activities; hard to judge when large groups are banned and there are ongoing restrictions on contact. “So the question to ask yourself is: once the opportunity does present itself – and in a limited, more muted way than previously – am I still able to motivate myself to see people?”

Another telling sign during pre-Covid times is feeling excessively tired and having problems sleeping. “Again, a lot of us have found that our energy levels, enthusiasm for life and ability to sleep well have been impacted on by the current crisis, and that’s a normal reaction to a very abnormal situation,” says Robinson. “But if it is affecting your life to the extent that you can’t get things done that need to get done, you can’t get the shopping in, you can’t bring yourself to eat or you’re overwhelmingly tired during the day so that you can’t function, these would be warning signs to seek help.”

Is not wanting to go out, or use public transport, a sign that you’re being sensible and following advice, or related to a deeper anxiety issue? The test, says Robinson, is when things start approaching something more normal and “whether people find that they’re excessively fearful of outside contact. Just being wary about public transport doesn’t mean you’ve got a mental health disorder. Nobody should be worried if they remain wary about things like public transport or crowded spaces for some time to come. That’s a highly likely and very normal adaptive response.”

The line we should draw, says Robinson, is about how we are functioning and the impact on our wellbeing. “We’re all living a lesser, quieter, more muted existence but there’s a difference between that and tipping into a clinical depression and anxiety, and the difference is to do with functioning.”

Chi-Chi Obuaya, a consultant psychiatrist, talks about “thriving and languishing. When one is thriving, there’s that ability to be outward-focused, optimistic, to pay good attention to sleep, nutrition and exercise levels. Generally, your mood is going to be on the brighter side; anxiety may come but the levels feel manageable. Conversely, when one is languishing, sleep is impaired, mood may fluctuate and anxiety levels are persistently high. There’s more of a ruminative thinking pattern, so constantly worrying about specific themes. And there’s an inward focus. Those things may indicate that someone needs additional support.”

The core symptoms of depression, he says, “are a low mood, a lack of energy and an inability to enjoy previously pleasurable activities. Alongside that, there may be disruption in sleep, appetite, concentration, and thoughts of not wanting to be alive or thinking very pessimistically. Whereas for anxiety disorders, I would want to emphasise that anxiety is a normal phenomenon, and the presence of anxiety doesn’t necessarily indicate that there’s definitely a mental health condition.” It’s when it becomes pervasive and has an “impact on our day-to-day functioning. So being able to attend to our personal hygiene, to cook, clean and to manage our finances, and our relationships as well. If we’re becoming very withdrawn, this also indicates a level of severity that probably warrants some input.” However, he points out, “everybody is different. Some people are more introverted, others are more extroverted, but the key baseline is what’s normal for you?”

Sarah Benjamin, whose health problems forced her to retire from her career as a consultant neonatologist, which led to depression, recognises the signs that her mental health is declining. A voracious reader, she notices that, during low periods, “I found that suddenly I wasn’t reading and I thought: ‘This is very odd. Why am I not doing what I always do?’ I’d start and I couldn’t concentrate. Sometimes, I couldn’t even pick up a book.” A few years ago, she started to learn to play the guitar and not wanting to play is another sign. “I haven’t played the guitar since lockdown. It’s something that I really enjoy, but I can’t kind of get around to doing it.” During low periods, “I tend to hide away a bit and not seek out friends I would normally see, I’ll find excuses why I can’t see them. So I know that I’ve got to force myself to do something.” Her amateur dramatics group has been incredibly important, giving her the opportunity to meet people “and just be silly”, but obviously it hasn’t been running this year. Keeping in touch with friends online has helped, says Benjamin, but it’s not the same.

Rifai, who experiences social anxiety, has actually enjoyed aspects of a quieter, less social year. It was taking on that job that created stress and anxiety. She knows that exercise – particularly walking – works for her, “and cutting down things like alcohol, and keeping really hydrated. Hydration was one that I realised, just from experimentation, is key for me. I recognise now that I have dips and I try not to let that overwhelm me. I try not to punish myself and say: ‘You’ve failed again, you’re going back to where you were.’ It’s just like: ‘No, this is just one of those days and you just have to work through this.’ And it’s on an hour-by-hour basis at that point.” She would seek help, she says, “if it got to the point that I wouldn’t be able to manage it myself”.

Contact your GP or NHS 111, says Robinson. “The charity Mind has an excellent website and you can access online tools through them,” she says. “You should be wary of just randomly Googling mental health apps because some are better than others.” There are other places to get support, such as Samaritans. “I would emphasise that it’s been an unprecedented year, which has presented challenges in all sorts of ways,” says Obuaya. “Therefore we shouldn’t make the assumption that because somebody is experiencing difficulty, or a degree of adversity, it necessarily indicates they’ve got a major mental health problem.” But, he stresses, there is “a range of help. I would encourage people to reach out.”

938,938,"Brexit: UK has lowered demands on fish catches, says EU",[],"Boris Johnson has lowered his Brexit demands by asking EU fishing fleets to hand over up to 60% of the value of stocks it takes from British waters, but the gap with Brussels remains wide, Michel Barnier has said ahead of what he described as a crucial 36 hours.

In briefings to EU ambassadors and MEPs in Brussels, the bloc’s chief negotiator said Downing Street had revised its demand down from 80%, but that it was unclear whether the divide could be bridged in the time remaining, prompting member states to caution against rushing into a deal.

The EU has so far offered the repatriation of 15%-18% of the value of stocks caught in the Channel, Irish Sea and north-east Atlantic, a proposal dismissed as “derisory” by Downing Street.

On the “level playing field” provisions, Barnier said common ground was slowly being found, with the UK offering greater flexibility in recent days over a mechanism to ensure that neither side can gain a competitive advantage by deregulating over time.

Speaking in front of EU representatives via videoconference from London, Barnier said some progress was also being made in giving Brussels assurances that future domestic subsidies by the UK government, known as state aid, would not distort trade once the transition period ends on 31 December

But there remain issues over whether a domestic regulator will give prior approval for subsidies and what unilateral remedies will be available in the event of a dispute.

“Barnier said the coming hours were going to be decisive to which the response was, ‘What’s the rush?’” said one senior EU diplomat. “Ambassadors for every country bordering the UK – 11 all in all – raised concerns on the level playing field and suggested that he was at the edge of his negotiating mandate.”

The EU ambassadors also urged Barnier not to allow fishing to become the last issue on the table for fear of pressure at the last moment, enabling the UK to run away with a deal damaging to the European fishing industry.

Barnier said the UK demand for annual negotiations on catches could be conceded, but that there would have to be a means to put tariffs on certain stocks if access was denied to EU boats.

Negotiators were also looking at including a review clause for the whole deal so that terms could be renegotiated in time, but a number of ambassadors spoke out against the proposal. “The EU wants a stable deal, not something that is going to be rewritten in a few years,” a source said.

Barnier told the ambassadors he would return to brief them on Friday, and emphasised the importance of progress during the talks in London in the next two days.

Timeline From Brefusal to Brexit: a history of Britain in the EU Show Hide After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially divorced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours. Brefusal The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project. Brentry With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.

Referendum The UK decides to stay in the common market after 67% voted ""yes"". Margaret Thatcher, later to be leader of the Conservative party, campaigned to remain. 'Give us our money back' Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the ""iron lady"" marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community. It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party. The Bruges speech Thatcher served notice on the EU community in a defining moment in EU politics in which she questioned the expansionist plans of Jacques Delors, who had remarked that 80% of all decisions on economic and social policy would be made by the European Community within 10 years with a European government in “embryo”. That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU. 'No, no, no' Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page. Black Wednesday A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The single market On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people"". Maastricht treaty Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union. John Major won the vote the following day in a pyrrhic victory. Repairing the relationship Tony Blair patches up the relationship. Signs up to social charter and workers' rights. Ukip Nigel Farage elected an MEP and immediately goes on the offensive in Brussels. “Our interests are best served by not being a member of this club,” he said in his maiden speech. “The level playing field is about as level as the decks of the Titanic after it hit an iceberg.” The euro Chancellor Gordon Brown decides the UK will not join the euro. EU enlarges to to include eight countries of the former eastern bloc including Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. EU expands again, allowing Romania and Bulgaria into the club. Migrant crisis Anti-immigration hysteria seems to take hold with references to “cockroches” by Katie Hopkins in the Sun and tabloid headlines such as “How many more can we take?” and “Calais crisis: send in the dogs”. David Cameron returns from Brussels with an EU reform package - but it isn't enough to appease the Eurosceptic wing of his own party Brexit referendum The UK votes to leave the European Union, triggering David Cameron's resignation and paving the way for Theresa May to become prime minister Britain leaves the EU After years of parliamentary impasse during Theresa May's attempt to get a deal agreed, the UK leaves the EU.

An EU diplomat said: “We are quickly approaching a make-or-break moment in the Brexit talks. Intensive negotiations are continuing in in London. As of this morning it is still unclear whether negotiators can bridge the gaps on issues like level playing, governance and fisheries.

“As we are entering the endgame of the Brexit negotiations, some member states are becoming a bit jittery. So this was mostly an exercise to calm nerves in Paris and elsewhere, and to reassure member states that team Barnier will continue to defend core EU interests, including on fisheries.”

A number of member states, including France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, has repeatedly stressed the importance of protecting Europe’s coastal communities, told Barnier they would prefer to restart the negotiations in 2021 than rush into a suboptimal agreement.

A source said: “Fish is getting down to nitty-gritty of species-by-species discussions. Barnier defended questions of whether the UK had moved enough on this issue, but they need to find a compromise Macron can back to find a deal.”

David McAllister, the German MEP who leads the European parliament’s Brexit steering committee, said a deal needed to be agreed urgently for the European parliament to give its consent by the end of the year.

He tweeted: “We are very much aware that the work on level playing field and state aid has entered the final phase. This is the critical moment where principles need to be translated into rules and, more importantly, rules need to be guaranteed by a robust enforcement framework.

“Swift progress is of the essence. An agreement needs to be reached within very few days if council and parliament are to complete their respective procedures before the end of the transition period. Democratic scrutiny is not negotiable.”

EU leaders are meeting next Thursday, but Brexit is yet to be put on the agenda, with sources suggesting that a deal or no-deal outcome is likely to be evident ahead of the summit.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1005,1005,The Queen's found a Caravaggio in her loft! Masterpieces from Buckingham Palace – review,[],"Some of the greatest paintings in Britain – and I mean works by the likes of Rembrandt, Vermeer and Rubens – all hang in a single room, namely the Picture Gallery of Buckingham Palace. It must be quite something to visit, the kind of royal sanctum many of us only see via The Crown on Netflix. Except we don’t – because, obviously, they weren’t allowed to film there. (Everyone notices their own clangers on the show: I stopped watching when Anthony Blunt, surveyor of the Queen’s pictures and a Soviet spy, explained art – and this collection – to HM using the term “early modern”. This old school art snob would no more have said “early modern” than he’d have said “taken to Twitter”. He’d have said “renaissance” or “baroque”.)

The Picture Gallery is having works done so its paintings are being shown at the Queen’s Gallery next door. So here they are, those early modern masterpieces, in a stunning revelation of the Royal Collection’s finest canvases. There is an entire wall of Rembrandts, each astonishing, some rarely seen out and about. I’ve never before looked into the eyes of Rembrandt’s rabbi. Always curious about his Jewish neighbours when he lived on Amsterdam’s Breestraat, the artist homes in on an old scholar’s anxious expression.

In another painting, overflowing with life, he depicts Jan Rijcksen, a shipbuilder, and his wife, Griet Jans. He is turning from his desk, where he’s studying ship designs, as she lunges in with a message. They’re consciously posing, playing themselves in a little drama of their lives together. Griet seems about to burst out laughing. But far from undermining the seriousness of the painting, this overt self-consciousness adds to its reality and depth by making us part of the game, and therefore part of a conversation with these people.

Consciously posing … Rembrandt’s Portrait of Jan Rijcksen and his Wife, Griet Jans, 1633. Photograph: Royal Collection Trust / © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2020

The most imposing of all is his portrait of Agatha Bas. This long-dead woman moves towards you, her gilded fan seeming to escape the canvas over a painted frame, her pale gaze formidable. If the Queen is ever in her Picture Gallery alone at night, I’ll bet this revenant spooks her. It spooked me.

The Rembrandts alone would make this an unmissable event. But he has rivals. It’s hard to be sure about Anthony van Dyck. Was he a great artist or just a very talented one? Here’s the answer. Right by the Rembrandts hangs his portrait of Thomas Killigrew, flaccidly resting his head on his hand beside a broken column as he slumps in grief. He’d recently lost his wife. A friend – thought to be William, Lord Crofts – is gently trying to distract him with work. The emotional punch and plain truth of this painting proves Van Dyck’s mettle. Then again, it is his very greatest work.

If portraits are not your thing, try Vermeer’s surreal frozen cinema. Light and shadow form an immense wall in the left part of A Lady at the Virginals with a Gentleman, which was formerly called The Music Lesson. She stands at her baroque keyboard, with her back to us, face caught in a high mirror along with other objects in the room. A man gazes intently at her but probably not to supervise her playing. Colour seems to immerse and embrace them, as if the big room they’re in were a bath of luminescent fluid.

It goes on. Rubens, like Van Dyck, knew and worked for the greatest British royal art collector, Charles I. His Milkmaids with Cattle in a Landscape glistens as if painted yesterday, bulges with roly-poly life as Rubens tries to distil all the forces and freedom of nature into a carnival of breezy colour. The same appetite for life spills out of his Portrait of a Woman, whose bulging bosom is swathed in translucent lace that rises up to form her ruff collar. It’s either an insight into baroque fashion or Rubens’s personal fetish. What stops you, though, is the creamy iridescent colour.

One of the strengths of rambling old art collections is that they can hold onto forgotten works that later get recognised as masterpieces. There’s a terrific painting here by Paulus Potter of cows: their knobbly bodies, in a Dutch meadow, are like tree roots or turds. The Royal Collection has lent Artemisia Gentileschi’s Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting to her sensational National Gallery show – she painted it for Charles I – and the Queen even found a Caravaggio up in the loft a while ago.

So I say this with respect for the Royal Collection’s virtues: this exhibition is disastrously brilliant. While I’m grateful that some of the royal family’s treasures are being revealed for a limited time, I object to them then going back to being decorations for state visits and royal audiences. The universality of this magnificent art should not serve as a prop in the royal pageant. It’s hard to believe the 21st-century monarchy really depends on owning all these Rembrandts.

After getting off the phone with a representative at DuPont, it turns out that 9.8 pounds of silicon and plastic is way more affordable than we assumed, meaning you can own the quantity of materials that make up an Xbox Series X for a mere $8.27!

Looks like Christmas came early for any gamers looking to buy the constituent components making up the hottest ticket of this holiday system!



Sure, Microsoft’s latest and greatest console might be backordered at every electronics store in the country, but that’s no excuse for not owning the basic materials that form its semiconductors and casing—and at a fraction of the cost! In fact, if you buy it wholesale at scale—we’re talking 200 to 300 pounds of silicon—you can get it for even cheaper. Of course, owning five palettes of industrial-grade silicon might be a bit much for the average gamer, but for the right person, it would mean having the equivalent of 30 Xbox Series Xs. Think about that!

Just imagine the look your friends will have when you invite them over to check out your new Xbox and you point out the pallet of chemical materials sitting on your entertainment center. Heck, you could even take a welding class for only an additional $125 or so at the local adult education center, and then you’re almost all the way to owning this face-melting graphical powerhouse. Assuming you get some sort of engineering degree, you could even melt the plastic down in an industrial furnace, form it into a shape approximating the real thing, and paint it matte black. Pretty cool, huh?

It’s enough to put a smile on any Microsoft fanboy or fangirl’s face!

Plus, Halo Infinite might not even be out yet, but the polycarbonate that its 4K Blu-Ray is made out of only costs $1.90 per pound. Picture the jealousy in your best bud’s eyes when you pull out a handful of that, point to it, and say, “T his could be Master Chief’s next adventure and it’s all mine! ” Really, all you’d have to do is carve the polycarbonate into 0.6 MM layers, then use a laser to inscribe it in just the right way and you’d be well on your way to getting the first-ever playable copy of 343 Industry’s next sci-fi epic in the whole world!

But jump on this deal quick, gamers! Once people catch wind that they could be getting their hands on a real-life approximation of the Series X for pennies on the dollar, they’re going to be standing in line outside every raw material supplier’s warehouse in the country.

411,411,Muhammad Ali flattens Cleveland Williams: Neil Leifer's best photograph,[],"Everyone assumes the picture I took of Ali v Liston in 1965 is my favourite – it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It’s the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I’ve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I’ve never taken a better photograph than this.

I shot 35 of Ali’s fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis’ days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.

When the Houston Astrodome was built it was the first of its kind. It had 50,000 seats and the lighting fixture was 80ft across and had to be elevated 80ft above the ring in order to avoid blocking anyone’s view in the seats high up. They could bring this rig right down to the floor so it was easy to fasten a camera to it. I realised I could use a normal lens and get the full ring with the symmetry of the press rows around it.

I always go into my jobs prepared. If the fight is 10pm on Saturday I wouldn’t show up at 7pm and have a beer with my buddies first. I’d show up on Wednesday, four days before, to deal with fight publicists and arena electricians to set up strobe lights and my remote camera. I remember getting a test roll developed before the fight to make sure my exposure and focus was right.

I gambled that there would be a good knockout. Sometimes a fighter crumples on their chest or falls into the ropes, but Williams landed flat on his back. I knew it happened in a good spot but I didn’t have a clue how it would turn out until the film was developed.

Ali was always whispering an exclusive to a journalist – but it was the same exclusive he’d just given to three others!

I was always a little crazy – most photographers don’t hang around the magazine’s photo labs, but I would go to make sure they didn’t mess up my film. I remember seeing this photo come out like it was yesterday. It was still wet, heading for the drying machine, but even then I knew it was special. Today, fighters come into the ring looking like wrestlers. But back in 1966 it was the old tradition: the champion in white trunks, the challenger in black, no logos or sponsors on the ring apron. The symmetry was perfect.

Look closely at the picture and you can see two television microphones hanging down, one near Ali’s head and one near Williams. All Ali had to do was be one foot forward, or Williams could have fallen a yard to his right, and it would have been a lousy shot.

The picture did not get much acclaim straight away; it ran small in Sports Illustrated. But photographers saw it. Ali’s next fight against Ernie Terrell was in the same venue and to my great satisfaction there were three or four photographers all vying to get that same spot on the lighting rig!

Ali was just one of the sweetest human beings you’d ever meet. Ali used to stop at a Jewish nursing home on his way back to Kennedy airport and chat with the old residents there – I went with him once. They’d wind him up saying: ‘You’re not that good, you know, Joe Louis would have knocked you on your ass!” He’d reply: “No way, I’d have had him in two rounds!”

I can count on one hand the athletes I’ve photographed that became social friends, but Muhammad Ali is one of them. We were friends until he died, his wife is still a friend of mine. Even when the Parkinson’s disease was so debilitating he was always available. He had great difficulty carrying on a conversation by the end, but he always liked having friendly faces around.

Did he ever comment on this shot? A couple of times. Whenever anyone asked him about this or the Liston picture, he would say: “Oh, that’s the greatest picture!” But when Howard Bingham showed him his pictures Ali would say, too, “that’s the greatest picture!” He was always whispering an exclusive in a journalist’s ear – but it was the same exclusive he’d just given to three other writers! He loved the camera and he loved every microphone. We’d do a studio shot and he’d say “I’ll give you 20 minutes” – then an hour later he’d still be suggesting poses.

When you get a great picture, over time you start to see tiny things that could make it better – maybe if I came in a little bit tighter, you know? But this picture is nearly 55 years old and, to this day, I’ve never found anything I could have done to make it better. I hit a grand slam home run.

736,736,LeBron James' $88m contract extension opens possibility of playing alongside son,[],"LeBron James, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to their first NBA title in a decade earlier this year, has agreed a two-year contract extension worth $88m, opening the possibility of him playing in the league at the same time as his son.

James’s agent, Rich Paul, confirmed the agreement to multiple outlets on Wednesday. James’s contract with the Lakers had been due to expire at the end of the 2021-22 season but the new deal gives him a slight raise to $41m in that season before he earns $44.5m in 2022-23. He will then become a free agent at the age of 38 in 2023, the same year as his eldest son, Bronny, graduates high school. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has said high school players will be able to go straight to the league in the near future, rather than playing in college, and Bronny is considered an elite talent.

James was named the MVP of this year’s NBA finals and also became the first player to win the title with three different teams. The 16-time All Star has also won championships with the Miami Heat and his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers.

The contract extension, once it is made official, will guarantee James career earnings of $429m.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
968,968,The Guardian view on a vaccination programme: keep politics out of it,[],"When the history of the pandemic is written, the tragic cost will be balanced with stories of human ingenuity and resilience. The speed with which effective vaccines have been developed will feature prominently on that side of the ledger.

No remedy existed when the threat first became apparent a year ago. It was not certain that vaccination would ever be possible. But the highest priority cases in the UK will start receiving doses of an approved vaccine in the coming weeks. The practical impact on infection rates will be modest for a while. But as a signal of what might one day be achieved, and a tonic to anyone whose spirit was flagging at prolonged social and economic restriction, Wednesday’s news is tremendous.

It represents, above all, an accomplishment of science, pursued by experts working at the frontiers of knowledge. It is a great moment for humanity, and should be celebrated in those terms. It should not be a time for political point-scoring, although it would take a government of unusual integrity to resist the temptation of grandstanding. Boris Johnson’s administration is not such a government.

Britain has approved the vaccine ahead of its European neighbours – a point advertised by ministers as the benefit of regulatory autonomy from the EU. That isn’t really true. The UK regulator may well have acted with great alacrity, but the regulatory process itself was facilitated by the continuity of data-sharing arrangements still in place by virtue of a transition period that retains terms of EU membership. And nothing in those terms legally prohibited the UK from acting as it has now done. The Brexit liberation boast is, as usual, a myth.

As for the development stage of the vaccine, like most modern scientific research, it has been a multicultural, international enterprise. Its success testifies more to the benefits that accrue in eliminating borders between nations than any effort to resurrect them.

If there is a lap of honour to be run, the government’s proper role is to applaud from the sidelines. Besides, ministers would do well to postpone glory-seeking until they have proved themselves capable of organising a national vaccination programme on an unprecedented scale. That will require a rigorous command of logistics, coordination between national and local government, clear and effective communication with the public and a sustained culture of transparency and professionalism. The record of the past year is hardly encouraging on any of those points.

There must not be a repeat of the mismanagement that has beset the national test-and-trace programme, or the dire messaging that confused people over regional lockdown rules. There is already enough public wariness of vaccinations without ministers stoking suspicion with incompetence and dishonest promises. One recent opinion poll found that about two-thirds of Britons would be prepared to have the vaccine. Around a quarter are not, with the remainder uncertain. There is much work of reassurance ahead, to which end party politics must be kept as far as possible from the whole business. Thankfully there is recognition of that imperative across the floor of the House of Commons, although the bipartisan spirit is often more vigorous in expression than application.

This process is still a long haul in the battle against Covid-19. The vaccine does not mark the end. There are countless complexities ahead. But it is a pivotal moment in the saga, and one for which everyone – regardless of nationality or political affiliation – is entitled to a moment of uncomplicated gratitude.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

208,208,UT San Antonio Sorority Kicks Student Out over Pro-Trump TikTok,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"A University of Texas-San Antonio (UTSA) student was kicked out of her sorority over a pro-Trump TikTok post featuring a sign reading “All Lives Matter.” Sorority leadership at the school told the student that language suggesting “all lives matter” is “extremely hurtful” and “unsisterly.”

UTSA student Jaycie Barton, a member of the Zeta Tau Alpha (ZTA) sorority as well as president of the school’s Turning Point USA (TPUSA) chapter, posted a video supporting President Donald Trump to her TikTok account in August.

The video, an eight-second clip featuring demonstrators holding an American flag and signs reading “Trump 2020,” “All Lives Matter,” and “Back the Blue,” subsequently got the student kicked out of her sorority.

On September 19, Barton received an email from UTSA ZTA’s judicial chairman, informing her that she had been charged with failing to “cooperate in the best interest of the Fraternity,” and for conducting herself “in a manner detrimental to her chapter and/or members of the Fraternity,” among other things.

The email went on to clarify that the charges were specifically for: “the statement ‘All Lives Matter’ is extremely hurtful to our sisters and is very unsisterly,” adding, “ZTA stands for Black Lives Matter and the statement ‘All Lives Matter’ goes against ZTA’s belief.”

“We have what’s called judicial board, where you get called up when you’ve done something wrong in the sorority,” explained Barton to Breitbart News, adding that a disciplinary hearing regarding her TikTok post was later held via Zoom.

During the sorority’s disciplinary hearing on September 21, one member argued that “Zeta is trying to be more inclusive, and saying ‘all lives matter’ is not being very inclusive.”

“It’s very unsisterly and very hurtful to a lot of people,” the member added.

Barton, however, told Breitbart News that she does support black lives.

“It’s pretty clear that I do support black lives,” said Barton. “And I don’t understand how the sorority cannot see that the word ‘all’ includes everyone.”

The student added that when she initially joined the sorority, no one had made her aware that she would have to support the Marxist political organization Black Lives Matter in order to retain her membership.

“I wasn’t joining the sorority to be a supporter of BLM,” said Barton. “I joined for philanthropy, which was breast cancer education and awareness, and to work alongside our sisters that would be open to all members, regardless of their political opinions and beliefs.”

Following the sorority’s disciplinary hearing, ZTA informed Barton that she had been removed from her leadership position as Risk Reduction and Education chair and that she was required “to complete a sensitivity training that involves inclusion and diversity.”

Barton said that she was later removed from the sorority completely, following another hearing regarding her TikTok post. The student added that she had requested to contact someone from the sorority’s national office regarding the matter, but that ZTA members would not allow it.

Barton told Breitbart News that as a result, she was bullied and smeared by sorority members, which she said runs counterintuitive to what ZTA claims to stand for.

“The sorority advocates for mental health, yet they allowed all these girls in the sorority to call me racist, flat out bullying me,” she said.

487,487,Aftermath of Moria refugee camp fire – photo essay,[],"During the night of 8 September, the Moria refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burst into flames. According to a Red Cross report the camp, the biggest of its kind in Europe, was at more than four times capacity. Nearly 11,000 people had to flee. Many left in panic, grabbing their children and leaving behind their few possessions. The Greek prime minister announced a four-month state of emergency on the island.

It is estimated that about 40% of Moria’s 13,000 residents were children, with seven out of 10 under the age of 12. Some were born in Moria and did not know life outside the camp

Many settled on a one-and-a-half kilometre stretch of coastal road, close to Mytilene, the small capital of Lesbos. People slept on the pavement and used trees and foliage to erect makeshift shelters to protect themselves from the sun. It seemed unthinkable, but life had just become even worse than in Moria.

Card games were particularly popular among the Afghan community

Photographer Vincent Haiges recalls the scene: “Walking through the remains of Europe’s biggest refugee camp, home for around 13.000 people in its last days, felt unreal. Though this feeling of estrangement was not caused by the overwhelming presence of destruction but rather the absence of sound. The chattering of voices, the clattering of dishes. All gone. Now you could only hear the birds and the rustling of cats strolling through the remains of the camp.”

A Valentine’s Day mug. Valentine’s Day is a popular celebration in Afghanistan

“Between the rubbles we found different objects, still witnesses of a former life. Toys, clothes or dishes. It felt as if those objects wanted to say: yes once there were people living here too. Some objects are witnesses of violence. Diazepam and Ibuprofen, means to bear what is unbearable. A lock used to protect someone’s home and family from mugging. Others are witnesses of resilience. A French copy of the New Testament. Maybe belonging to the Congolese community, who so vividly hold their services between the olive trees? The charred kitchen grater used for cooking. For many cooking was a way of keeping the memories of the place they left behind alive.”

Top row: a sim card and phone case. Network quality in Moria was low and there was only one wifi spot, which was often overstrained. For many, however, using their phone was the main activity, either to keep in contact with friends and family back home or simply to kill time. Bottom row: a French copy of the New Testament. There were 12 different African Christian communities in Moria. They used to pray in the fields surrounding the camp

“The owners of those objects are now inside the new camp. Not much is coming out of there, since access for press is prohibited. It is yet another attempt of the European Union to render the situation on the Aegean islands invisible.”

A food distribution card from the non-governmental organisation Refugee4Refugees. Basic services relied on the support of NGOs, whose role became controversial to the extent that some critics maintained their work enabled the continued existence of camps such as Moria

“This is why it is so important to keep the situation of the people seeking asylum alive, even though we only see the object they left behind.”

According to the UNHCR UN high commissioner for refugees, there are approximately 121,100 asylum seekers and migrants in Greece, including 4,200 children who arrived unaccompanied, or were separated from their families on the way.

Overcrowding is widespread on the Aegean islands and by the end of September about 21,400 people were crammed into spaces with an estimated combined capacity of 6,200.

Top row: cooking their own food was for many a way of preserving their cultural identity. Bottom right: a padlock used to secure homes against thieves. During the night, the camp often turned into a place of violent confrontation. Robbery, the harassment of women, brawls or knife attacks were quite frequent

The UNHCR has warned for some time of the urgent need to address the situation and conditions for asylum seekers on the Aegean islands, where many must cope with dire living conditions and are exposed to security risks including sexual and gender-based violence.

A child’s shoe. Children in the camp were particularly vulnerable. Many experienced mental health issues including self-harm and attempted suicide

Since the fire, large-scale transfers out of Lesbos to the mainland have helped reduce the number of people whose lives have been blighted. By the beginning of November, about 2,800 people had left the island.

More than 7,000 people remain in the emergency site at Mavrovouni, established to accommodate those rendered homeless by the fire.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
795,795,Tier 2 lockdown rules in England: the latest Covid restrictions explained,[],"The new system came into force in England on 2 December, replacing the national lockdown

England’s new three-tier system came into effect on 2 December after the national lockdown was lifted.

Non-essential shops in all areas can reopen, as can gyms, hairdressers and other personal care businesses, with the formal instruction to stay at home coming to an end. The “rule of six” will again apply for outdoor gatherings in all areas.

Places of worship will be able to open and weddings will be allowed within local restrictions.

What are the rules in tier 2?

Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close.

As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors.

Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000.

Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, can open, but must close at 11pm.

Everyone who can work from home should do so.

The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found here.

When will the tiers be reviewed?

The tiers will be reviewed on 16 December, any changes to the tiers will be announced on 17 December, and changes will come into force on 19 December.

For five days over Christmas – from 23 December to 27 December – there will be a UK-wide relaxation of rules to let up to three households form a bubble so they can mix socially indoors and stay overnight to enjoy the festive period together.

In Scotland, a maximum of eight people will be allowed but that does not include under-12s. In Northern Ireland, the window has been extended to 22-28 December to allow for additional travel time between countries.

849,849,Manchester City hit back at Porto after criticism of Pep Guardiola and players,[],"Manchester City have dismissed “ill-judged criticism” from Porto after the Portuguese club took aim at Fernandinho, Pep Guardiola and Bernardo Silva, who was incorrectly described as having been “convicted of racism”.

Porto’s move came after City drew 0-0 at the Estádio do Dragão in the Champions League on Tuesday and is the latest flare-up involving the clubs. In an official newsletter Porto referred to Silva, a Portugal international, as “an opponent of ours who is known internationally for having been convicted of racism”.

Silva was banned last year for one match after tweeting an image of his City teammate Benjamin Mendy next to the controversial logo of the Spanish confectionery brand Conguitos, but the Football Association independent commission wrote: “His tweet was not intended by him to be either racist or offensive in any way.”

After the reverse fixture in October, which City won, Porto’s coach Sergio Conceição accused Guardiola and his staff of haranguing the match officials, which Guardiola rejected. Before the match on Tuesday Conceição described Silva as “childish” for a tweet that followed City’s victory in which the midfielder wrote: “This one felt so good!”

Porto’s newsletter claimed Guardiola had a “bad disposition after the meeting” on Tuesday and quoted Conceição as saying: “I would also be upset if I couldn’t win with the team he has and the budget he has.”

Regarding Fernandinho, the letter said: “Despite being 35 [he] is a clear example that football money counts a lot, but it doesn’t buy class or notion.” In response a City spokesperson said: “This is not the first time Porto have reacted badly in circumstances like this. On this occasion it is the ill-judged and targeted criticism of some of our players and indeed our manager, which we wholly reject.

“In 2012, the last season we encountered them, it was the denial by the club of the clear racist behaviour of their fans for which they were investigated and fined. In this context the latest outburst is almost as surprising as it is disappointing.”

The incident referred to came at the Dragão in February 2012, when the City forward Mario Balotelli was found by Uefa to have been racially abused by Porto supporters.

Joleon Lescott, who was in City’s XI then and was a BT pundit for the game on Tuesday, tweeted: “Strange reading the statement from Porto the game looked comfortable to me. Annoying part is the racism claim. No racism should be ignored and trying to deflect isn’t going to work. Clearly selective memory, I’m sure them receiving a fine for targeting Mario in 2012 just a memory.”

The stark message from António Guterres follows a year of global upheaval, with the coronavirus pandemic causing governments to shut down whole countries for months at a time, while wildfires, hurricanes and powerful storms have scarred the globe.

Guterres said: “Humanity is waging war on nature. This is suicidal. Nature always strikes back – and it is already doing so with growing force and fury. Biodiversity is collapsing. One million species are at risk of extinction. Ecosystems are disappearing before our eyes … Human activities are at the root of our descent toward chaos. But that means human action can help to solve it.”

Great Barrier Reef outlook 'critical' as climate change called number one threat to world heritage Read more

He listed the human-inflicted wounds on the natural world: the spread of deserts; wetlands lost; forests cut down; oceans overfished and choked with plastic; dying coral reefs; air pollution killing 9 million people a year, more than the current pandemic; and the fact that 75% of new and emerging human infectious diseases have, like Covid-19, come from animals.

Q&A What is the Paris climate agreement? Show Hide The 2015 Paris climate agreement is the first truly global deal to tackle climate change. It commits governments to limit temperature rises to no more than 2C (3.6F) – which scientists say is the threshold of safety, beyond which the effects of global warming are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible – and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C. It has been signed by 197 countries. The US is on course to become the only country outside the agreement if it follows through on Donald Trump’s vow to leave.

Though Guterres, like his two predecessors, has frequently spoken on the dangers of the climate crisis, this was his strongest language yet. The UN was founded 75 years ago at the end of the second world war to try to promote world peace after two devastating global conflicts. Guterres made a deliberate invocation of that original mission, applying it to the climate and biodiversity crises.

“Making peace with nature is the defining task of the 21st century,” he said, in a virtual address entitled The State of the Planet, at Columbia University in New York. “It must be the top, top priority for everyone, everywhere.”

He said future generations would face ruin from our actions today. “This is an epic policy test. But ultimately this is a moral test … We cannot use [our] resources to lock in policies that burden [future generations] with a mountain of debt on a broken planet.”

He also put inequality firmly at the heart of the problem, warning that the poorest and most vulnerable – even in rich countries – were facing the brunt of the attack.

Guterres said greenhouse gas emissions were 62% higher than when international climate negotiations began in 1990. A report from the World Meteorological Organisation, also published on Wednesday, found 2020 was on track to be one of the three warmest years on record globally, despite the cooling effects of the La Niña weather system, while the past decade was the hottest in human history and ocean heat was found to be at record levels.

Even with the impacts of the coronavirus crisis, greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise again this year.

However, Guterres also struck a note of hope. Many countries, including the biggest emitter, China, the EU, and the US president-elect, Joe Biden, have adopted targets of reaching net-zero emissions around the middle of the century. Renewable energy is now cheaper than coal in many regions, and new technologies such as electric vehicles are gaining pace.

He said: “I firmly believe that 2021 can be a new kind of leap year – the year of a quantum leap towards carbon neutrality. Sound economic analysis is our ally.”

Investors and governments must seize the opportunity to “flick the green switch” while there was still time, he said. He looked ahead to the vital UN Cop26 climate talks, to be hosted by the UK next year, as the moment when nations should make a decisive turn towards a green global economy.

In 10 days’ time, Guterres, along with the French government and Boris Johnson, will host a summit of world leaders to prepare for the Cop26 talks that were postponed by a year to next November because of the pandemic.

At the Climate Ambition Summit, which marks five years since the forging of the Paris agreement, governments are expected to affirm plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions drastically in the next decade, in line with their long-term goals.

Earlier this week, the Climate Action Tracker calculated that if all the net-zero pledges made by governments and leaders were to be fulfilled, temperatures would rise by about 2.1C above pre-industrial levels. That is not far above the upper limit set by the Paris agreement, of holding temperatures to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, regarded as the limit of safety beyond which climate breakdown is likely to become catastrophic and irreversible.

However, that depends on long-term targets set for decades hence to be fulfilled with action now. Guterres warned that pledges were not enough in themselves.

He said: “We need all governments to translate these pledges into policies, plans and targets with specific timelines. This will provide certainty and confidence for businesses and the financial sector to invest for net zero.”

Guterres called for countries to put a price on carbon emissions, stop investing in fossil fuels and phase out fossil fuel subsidies, stop building new coal power plants, and to shift their fiscal base from taxing incomes to taxing pollution.

He also said governments must act swiftly on the biodiversity crisis, as the UN plans several major conferences next year that will address species destruction, the oceans, food production and cities. “Next year gives us a wealth of opportunities to stop the plunder and start the healing,” he said.

The stark message from Guterres was echoed by Laurent Fabius, the French foreign minister, who led the landmark Paris conference in 2015. “There is no vaccine against climate warming,” he warned. “But there is an antidote, which is to fully implement the Paris agreement.”

He said financial assistance for developing countries would be essential to forging a global consensus on reaching net-zero emissions, as it was fundamental to success at Paris.

“Money, money, money,” said Fabius, was key to the talks, and rich countries must make good on their promise to provide at least $100bn a year to developing nations, to help them cut emissions and cope with the impacts of climate breakdown.

Along with financial assistance, governments must try to ensure that the transition to a green economy benefited all sections of society, added Fabius. “The question of climate change is also a question of inequality. We must deal with this, otherwise we have a big problem.”

Amber Rudd, the former UK energy and climate minister, who represented the UK at the Paris talks, said Boris Johnson had weakened his own position at Cop26 by reducing the UK’s spending on overseas aid, which would diminish the host’s leverage in bringing developing countries together.

“A country that understood the seriousness of Cop26 would not be cutting international aid right now,” she said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

761,761,"Faith review – compelling, beautifully shot doc on an Italian cult",[],"This documentary will be the last film we see from Italian director Valentina Pedicini who died last month tragically young, aged 42, from liver cancer. And what an extraordinary film it is, opening with an intoxicating rave scene: a room full of lithe muscular men and women dressed all in white, some with shaved heads, dancing furiously to German techno. They are monks, disciples of the Master: the oldest man in the room, a martial arts expert who 20 years ago opened a monastery in the Italian hills where he trains “warrior monks” in Catholicism and kung fu. He is the god of his little universe.

At the start, Faith could be a quirky tale about a bunch of wacky eccentrics as it follows the monks’ daily routines and rituals: combat training, prayer, boxing lessons for teeny toddlers, a monastery meeting to discuss expelling a monk. The film is gorgeously cinematic, shot by DOP Bastian Esser in textured black and white – it looks like a Rossellini. The strictly observational, no-interview style can be a little frustrating; it doesn’t help that the monks have a roundabout, indirect way of expressing themselves. But there’s no mistaking the increasingly sinister mood.

The picture that emerges of is of emotional abuse and control. The Master dominates his acolytes, particularly the women, who are woken up in the middle of the night and summoned to his bedroom for creepy group therapy sessions – five or six at a time gathered around his bed. His workout sessions with them are power trips. His goal seems to be submission, body and soul. He pushes them until they are broken – to fuel his narcissism and ego, I’d say. It’s deeply uncomfortable film but also weirdly gripping. Now I’d like the long read version: who is the Master, and what are the stories of the monks that brought them to this way of life?

724,724,The Undoing was the perfect pandemic TV,[],"If you want to murder people for entertainment there are certain rules that really ought to be followed. Namely, you’ve got to give an attentive audience a chance to work out whodunit. The members of the Detection Club, a 1930s secret society of British mystery writers including Agatha Christie and GK Chesterton, were obsessed with this idea of “fair play”. Members of the club pledged not to conceal vital clues from the reader and make no use of “Divine Revelation, Feminine Intuition, Mumbo Jumbo, Jiggery-Pokery, Coincidence, or Act of God.”

What, one wonders, would the Detection Club have made of The Undoing? The star-studded HBO drama on Sky Atlantic didn’t include any divine revelations but it had a hell of a lot of bizarre plot holes and red herrings. I won’t spoil the ending for those who haven’t seen it, but it left audiences feeling duped rather than out-smarted. The show gave you all the clues to figure out whodunit – it shoved them right in your face at the beginning and left them there – but somehow it didn’t really play fair. There were too many loose ends and unbelievable plot points. You also spent half the time wondering why everyone’s accent kept changing; Nicole Kidman, in particular, seemed to forget she was playing an American.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying The Undoing was a bad show. Quite the opposite: despite its underwhelming ending it was perfect pandemic TV. Many us have been spending lockdown looking at property porn, imagining all the glamorous places we could be quarantined if only our budgets allowed, and The Undoing was full of fabulously wealthy New Yorkers in extremely fancy homes. You got to marvel at the 1%’s mansions while simultaneously feeling glad you weren’t one of them because they were all so sad or sociopathic. I also enjoyed watching Kidman strut around Manhattan in her collection of fancy coats. It’s weird to feel homesick for the city that you live in, but seeing New York in all its pre-pandemic glory did exactly that.

Perhaps the best part of the Undoing, however, was its length. The six-part limited miniseries was long enough for you to get invested in it; short enough not to get tedious. 2020 feels like it is dragging on and on – giving me a new appreciation for TV shows that know how to swiftly wrap things up.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
796,796,Piers Corbyn found guilty of breaching regulations at lockdown protest,[],"Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour party leader, has been found guilty of breaching emergency health regulations at an anti-lockdown protest in London’s Hyde Park.

During the two-day trial in Westminster magistrates court, the 73-year-old weather forecaster and climate change denier argued that his rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly had been illegally restricted.

Corbyn had denied two counts of participating in public gatherings of more than two people during the coronavirus emergency in Hyde Park on 16 Mayand 30 May.

He was convicted of an offence on the first date but acquitted on the later charge. District Judge Sam Goozee ruled that it was wrong for Corbyn to be charged with breaching the regulations on 30 May , because he had already been issued with a fixed-penalty notice earlier that day.

Finding him guilty on the first charge, Goozee said: “Without the regulations in place, your conduct would have been lawful. But the enforcement of regulations was necessary for public health.

“Police took a measured response. You, however, didn’t engage with police – police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate.”

The judge gave Corbyn an absolute discharge – meaning he will not be fined or face any further punishment – after hearing that he had spent 12 hours in custody after being arrested.

David Povall, prosecuting, earlier told the court that the gathering near the park’s Speakers’ Corner on 16 May involved around 100 anti-lockdown protesters. Corbyn, of Southwark, south London, had taken part in the protests by “addressing the gathering and encouraging … others to gather around him to listen to what he was saying,” the court heard.

Povall said officers had adopted a “light-touch policing” approach by encouraging the gatherings to “disperse without the necessity for enforcement action”.

But Corbyn, he added, had “deliberately” participated in the gathering “by way of making public addresses” and that he allegedly “disregarded advice and directions from police over a sustained period”.

A video played to the court showed Corbyn using a megaphone to claim that Covid-19 “is not a pandemic” and argue that “if it carries on like this, we have a Big Brother society imposed upon us”.

But Ben Cooper, QC, representing Corbyn, told the court: “This case concerns a 73-year-old, law-abiding man, who attended Speakers’ Corner alone on two occasions to peacefully and exclusively express dissent through use of speech.

“Mr Corbyn attended to deliver a short speech, and he did so during a period of time when members of the public were permitted and indeed encouraged to go outdoors for a variety of other, banal purposes. A man of good character, Mr Corbyn spent a considerable amount of time in a police cell as a result.”

Cooper said police made no attempts to facilitate a safe protest consistent with public health regulations. A “blanket ban” on all demonstrations was not necessary for the legitimate aim of protection of public health, Cooper added.

On the second date, other protests, including a Black Lives Matter demonstration, had been allowed to go ahead, the court was told.

Addressing around two dozen supporters outside the court after the verdict, Corbyn raised his fist in the air and said: “We’ve had a tremendous result.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interpol has issued a global alert to law enforcement agencies around the world warning them that organised crime networks may try to sell fake Covid-19 vaccines or steal real supplies.

The global police coordination agency, based in France, said on Wednesday it had issued an orange alert to police forces in its 194 member states warning them to prepare for vaccines to be targeted both physically and online.

It said the pandemic had already triggered “unprecedented opportunistic and predatory criminal behaviour” and warned of a new wave of criminal activity “in relation to the falsification, theft and illegal advertising of Covid-19 vaccines”.

The agency called for close coordination between health regulators and law enforcement as vaccines come closer to approval and distribution so as to ensure the safety of the supply chain and identify illicit websites selling fakes.

As governments prepare to roll out mass vaccination programmes, criminal gangs “plan to infiltrate or disrupt supply chains, and also target the public via fake websites and false cures that could pose a significant risk to their health, even their lives”, the Interpol secretary general, Jürgen Stock, said.

“It is essential that law enforcement is as prepared as possible for what will be an onslaught of all types of criminal activity linked to the Covid-19 vaccine,” he said.

The agency said criminal gangs were also highly likely to start parallel production and distribution of “unauthorised and falsified” coronavirus testing kits as international travel resumes and airlines and immigration authorities increasingly demand passengers produce a negative test result.

Interpol also warned the public to take special care when going online to search for medical equipment or medicines. It said people faced danger not just from potentially life-threatening products, but also from cyber-threats.

An analysis by its cybercrimes unit of about 3,000 online pharmaceuticals websites suspected of selling illicit products showed that more than 1,700 contained phishing or spamming malware, the agency said.

“It is important to be vigilant, sceptical and safe, as offers which appear too good to be true usually are,” the agency said.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

There’s a perfect opportunity to avail yourself of some of the ship’s range of five-star facilities this morning – maybe a little gentle exercise in the fitness room before heading up to the sun deck to enjoy a coffee whilst chatting with newly-made friends as our ship makes a graceful arrival in Porto once more, passing under the city’s spectacular bridges. Porto is of course synonymous with wonderful port wine and all the famous port producers are here, such as Cálem, Sandeman and Ferreira, so a visit here would not be complete without a tour of one of them. You’ll learn about this fortified wine’s fascinating history and its close British connections. Port is made from grapes still pressed in the traditional way – by feet – then lovingly matured, sometimes for decades, before you can enjoy its subtle flavours. Of course, you’ll get the chance to sample various port styles at the end of our visit. After lunch on board we enjoy a guided tour of Porto. Strategically overlooking the Douro as it empties into the Atlantic, Portugal’s second largest city was originally a Roman town, but its wealth derived from its knowledge of the sea routes to India, with fortunes made from trading spices, silks and other fine goods. Our tour unveils some of its major and more surprising sights. You’ll have the rest of the afternoon to explore the truly fascinating city; so perhaps return to the terraced streets of the old town and wander the sloping maze of winding, cobbled alleyways, soaking up the atmosphere whilst stopping to admire the lovely architecture, soaring bell towers, fine baroque churches, golden rooftops and beautiful tiles of this slice of traditional Portugal. Stop for a drink in a cosy café and be tempted by an array of delicious cakes and pastries – perhaps sample a pastel de nata, the traditional Portuguese custard tart. This evening, enjoy a final dinner on board expertly served by our restaurant staff under the supervision of the maître d’. Afterwards, perhaps settle into the lounge to chat into the evening and reflect on the splendours of the remarkable River Douro – over a glass of port, of course.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

578,578,Iran reprieves scientist facing execution for espionage,[],"A Swedish-Iranian scientist facing execution in Iran for espionage on Wednesday has been granted a reprieve, his lawyer has said.

Ahmadreza Djalali was not been transferred out of Evin prison in Tehran to Raja’i Shahr jail as expected on Tuesday night, his lawyer said, which would have been a prelude to his killing.

It was not immediately clear if the reprieve was temporary or arose from the intense public and diplomatic pressure placed on the Iranian authorities to re-examine his case.

His wife, Vida Mehrannia, made media appeals, including to the Guardian, on Tuesday night urging European governments to come to her husband’s aid. There had also been an intense campaign by Amnesty International, but the mood on Tuesday night had been one of foreboding.

Ann Linde, the Swedish foreign minister, had spoken last week to the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, urging that his case be re-examined.

An Iranian national and resident of Sweden, Djalali is a medical doctor, lecturer and researcher in disaster medicine who was arrested in April 2016 after being invited by Iran to a conference. A video of his confession was aired on Iranian state TV in December 2017 after he was charged with helping Israel prepare attacks on Iranian nuclear scientists.

UN human rights experts said in 2017: “The procedure against him was marred by numerous reports of due process and fair trial violations, including incommunicado detention, denial of access to a lawyer, and forced confession.”

The UN said he had been “reportedly threatened with torture and other forms of ill-treatment, and threatened with being sentenced to death through an expedited process” and then “forced to repeat dictated statements before video cameras”.

He was sentenced to death in October 2017 and the supreme court reaffirmed the sentence in November.

There have been reports that the threatened execution could yet be linked to the trial in Belgium of an Iranian diplomat. Assadollah Assadi, who was serving at the embassy in Vienna, is accused of providing explosives to two individuals to bomb a rally of the opposition group the National Council of Resistance of Iran near Paris on 30 June 2018. Iran may be seeking to organise a prisoner swap, as it has on previous occasions. Belgian prosecutors are seeking a 20-year prison sentence.

Sophie Wilmès, Belgium’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, spoke with Zarif to “discuss consular issues” on Wednesday, Iranian news agencies reported. Iran is claiming diplomatic immunity for Assadi and he has refused to appear in court.

Wilmès also condemned the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last Friday. Iran claimed on Thursday to have identified the individuals responsible for bringing weapons into the country, but gave no details.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

206,206,Former Coinbase Employees Claim Discrimination After CEO Blasts Woke Capitalism,['Tom Ciccotta'],"Former employees of the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase told the New York Times that they experienced racist and discriminatory treatment during their time with the company. The report comes just weeks following the adoption of a company policy that prohibited discussion of politics at the workplace. CEO Brian Armstrong said at the time, “We don’t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission.”

According to a report by the New York Times, former employees at Coinbase are speaking out against an alleged pattern of discrimination at the company. Coinbase was founded in 2012 to serve as an exchange for emerging cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The platform has since expanded to several other cryptocurrencies.

In 2018 and 2019, 15 black employees at the company reportedly complained about a pattern of racism and discrimination at the company. Alysa Butler, who resigned from Coinbase in 2019, suggested that Coinbase is worse than any other Silicon Valley company when it comes to “diversity.”

“Most people of color working in tech know that there’s a diversity problem,” Butler said. “But I’ve never experienced anything like Coinbase.”

Ruby Bhattacharya, a former recruiter for Coinbase, claims that her former colleagues ostracized her over her sexuality and race. “I was told I don’t have the right brain for this,” she said. “It was constant condescension.”

Breitbart News reported in October that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong told employees that they would not be permitted to discuss politics at the workplace. Armstrong was criticized for the policy by progressive leaders in Silicon Valley.

“We don’t engage here when issues are unrelated to our core mission, because we believe impact only comes with focus,” Armstrong wrote in a blog post. “We don’t advocate for any particular causes or candidates internally that are unrelated to our mission, because it is a distraction from our mission. Even if we all agree something is a problem, we may not all agree on the solution.”

139,139,"Barbra Streisand Gushes: Biden Will ‘Bring Back Dignity, Honesty, Intelligence, and Compassion’",['David Ng'],"Barbra Streisand is “exhilarated” about the prospect of Joe Biden becoming president, saying that Biden will “bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office.”

The Oscar-winning Hollywood leftist also bashed President Donald Trump in an interview with the New York Times, calling him a liar and blaming him for the loss of “thousands of lives.” The accusation is one that Streisand has repeatedly made on social media, having previously claimed that President Trump’s “incompetence and lies” are responsible for thousands of coronavirus fatalities.

In her talk with the Time’s T style magazine, Barbra Streisand expressed her thrill at the possibility of Joe Biden, who recently broke his foot, taking office. “I’m exhilarated … [He] will bring back dignity, honesty, intelligence and compassion to the Oval Office. I look forward to that.”

Neither Streisand nor the Times reporter brought up the Hunter Biden scandal or Tara Reade’s sexual assault allegations against the presidential hopeful.The singer-actress was a major supporter of Biden’s campaign, participating in several Hollywood fundraisers for the Democratic candidate.

“What do I hate most about Trump? He lies every day,” she told the Times. “He has the compulsion to lie, even when the facts say something different. The worst lie was about the pandemic. Why not face facts? Why not tell the truth? People are stronger than you think — they can handle the truth. It would have saved thousands of lives.”

Streisand didn’t clarify her allegation claiming that the president has lied about the pandemic. She also omitted the fact the President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, which fast-tracked a public-private partnership with drug makers to develop a coronavirus vaccine. The project has yielded vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna that are expected to start reaching the public in December.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) added her praise for Streisand to the article, lauding the Hollywood celebrity for her political activism that started before it became fashionable.

“It took real courage back then to get involved because the entertainment industry believed there’d be a backlash,” Pelosi told the Times. Streisand in fundraising mode “is dazzling to behold,” Pelosi added. “It’s not just because she’s a celebrity. She knows the issues. She’s studied. She can explain why she supports what she does. That’s what’s persuasive.”

Pelosi continued: “She doesn’t have to do this… She does it out of patriotism. She loves our country.”

Streisand also told the Times that she reached out to the daughter of George Floyd shortly after he died while in Minneapolis policy custody, setting off race riots around the country.

Streisand said she sent six-year-old Gianna some shares of Disney stock, along with a letter in which she recounted how she also lost her father at a young age.

“I think our dads watch over us forever,” Streisand wrote, according to the Times. “When you get older and have a decision to make … just close your eyes and ask him for help. And if you listen very carefully, he will lead you to the right choice. I promise!”

499,499,A mission for journalism in a time of crisis,[],"‘No former period, in the history of our Country, has been marked by the agitation of questions of a more important character than those which are now claiming the attention of the public.” So began the announcement, nearly 200 years ago, of a brand-new newspaper to be published in Manchester, England, which proclaimed that “the spirited discussion of political questions” and “the accurate detail of facts” were “particularly important at this juncture”.

Now we are living through another extraordinary period in history: one defined by dazzling political shocks and the disruptive impact of new technologies in every part of our lives. The public sphere has changed more radically in the past two decades than in the previous two centuries – and news organisations, including this one, have worked hard to adjust.

A mission for journalism in a time of crisis – podcast Read more

But the turbulence of our time may demand that we do more than adapt. The circumstances in which we report, produce, distribute and obtain the news have changed so dramatically that this moment requires nothing less than a serious consideration of what we do and why we do it.

The Scott Trust, which owns the Guardian, stated a very clear purpose when it was established in 1936: “to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity and to safeguard the journalistic freedom and liberal values of the Guardian free from commercial or political interference.” As an editor, it’s hard to imagine a finer mission for a proprietor: our sole shareholder is committed only to our journalistic freedom and longterm survival.

But if the mission of the Scott Trust is to ensure that Guardian journalism will exist for ever, it is still left to us to define what the mission of that journalism will be. What is the meaning and purpose of our work? What role do we play in society?

After working at the Guardian for two decades, I feel I know instinctively why it exists. Most of our journalists and our readers do, too – it’s something to do with holding power to account, and upholding liberal values. We know what defines a Guardian story, what feels like a Guardian perspective, what makes something “very Guardian” (for better and for worse).

In my own work as editor of the Guardian in Australia, and then as the editor of the Guardian in the US, I tried to conceptualise the Guardian with a different accent – to identify the essential qualities of Guardian journalism and bring them to new audiences. Now, as the editor-in-chief of the Guardian and the Observer, I believe our time requires something deeper. It is more urgent than ever to ask: who are we, fundamentally?

The answer to this question is in our past, our present and our future. I want to lead a Guardian that relates to the world in a way that reflects our history, engages deeply with this disorientating global moment, and is sustainable for ever.

The history of the Guardian begins on 16 August 1819, when John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist, attended an enormous demonstration for parliamentary reform in Manchester. In St Peter’s Field, a popular radical speaker, Henry Hunt, addressed a crowd estimated to contain 60,000 people – more than half the population of the Manchester area at the time, dressed in their Sunday best and packed in so tightly that their hats were said to be touching.

At the time, the mood in the country was insurrectionary. The French revolution, three decades earlier, had spread throughout the world the seismic idea that ordinary people could face down the powerful and win – a revelation for the masses and a fright for those in power. After Britain’s victory at Waterloo and the end of the Napoleonic wars, the country was mired in economic depression and high unemployment, while the Corn Laws, which kept the price of grain artificially high, brought mass hunger. There were protests and riots throughout the country, from handloom weavers trashing newly invented factory machinery to anti-slavery campaigners boycotting sugar.

There was also a growing campaign for the vote: the big, densely populated city of Manchester had no member of parliament – while Old Sarum, a prosperous hamlet in southern England, with just one voter, had two MPs to represent him. The city’s businessmen were demanding an overhaul of this rotten system – and working men (and, for the first time, women) wanted their own chance to vote.

The combination of economic depression, political repression and the politicisation of workers with economic need was combustible. As the essayist William Hazlitt wrote one year earlier, “nothing that was established was to be tolerated … the world was to be turned topsy-turvy.”

As most of Manchester gathered in St Peter’s Field on 16 August, the city’s magistrates, intimidated by the size of the crowd and their demands, ordered armed cavalry to charge into the crowd – to break up the meeting and arrest Hunt and other speakers on the podium. The troops stormed through the people, hacking with their sabres and “cutting at everyone they could reach”. Eleven people were killed on the day, seven men and four women, and many hundreds were injured. It became known as the Peterloo massacre or the Battle of Peterloo, and its impact was huge: the historian AJP Taylor said that Peterloo “began the breakup of the old order in England”.

John Edward Taylor was in the crowd that day, reporting for a weekly paper, the Manchester Gazette. When a reporter for the daily Times of London was arrested, Taylor was concerned that the people of the capital might not get an accurate report of the massacre – he correctly feared that without the account of a journalist on the scene, Londoners would instead get only the official version of events, which would protect the magistrates who had caused the bloodshed.

So Taylor rushed a report on to the night coach to London, got it into the Times, and thus turned a Manchester demonstration into a national scandal. Taylor exposed the facts, without hysteria. By reporting what he had witnessed, he told the stories of the powerless, and held the powerful to account.

But Taylor did not stop there. After the massacre, he spent months reporting on the fate of the wounded, documenting the injuries of more than 400 survivors.

Quick guide What was the Peterloo massacre? Show Hide What was the Peterloo Massacre and how many were killed? On 16 August 1819, up to 60,000 working class people from the towns and villages of what is now Greater Manchester marched to St Peters Fields in central Manchester to demand political representation. Their peaceful protest turned bloody when Manchester magistrates ordered Yeoman – a private militia paid for by rich locals – to storm the crowd with sabres. Most historians agree that 14 people were definitely killed in the massacre – 15 if you include the unborn child of Elizabeth Gaunt, killed in the womb after she was beaten by constables in custody. A further three named people are believed to have either been stabbed or trampled to death. Why is it called Peterloo? The name was first coined five days after the massacre by James Wroe, editor of the Manchester Observer, the city’s first radical newspaper (no relation to the Observer of today). According to historian Robert Poole, Peterloo was “a bitter pun, comparing the cowardly attacks by the Yeomanry and soldiers on unarmed civilians to the brutality suffered at Waterloo.” What did the protesters want? They wanted political reform. The years leading up to Peterloo had been tough for working class people and they wanted a voice in parliament to put their needs and wants on the political agenda, inspired by the French Revolution across the Channel. Machines had begun to take jobs in the lucrative cotton industry but periodic trade slumps closed factories at short notice, putting workers out on the street. The Napoleonic Wars, which ended in 1815 with the Battle of Waterloo, had taken a heavy toll on the nation’s finances, and 350,000 ex-servicemen returned home needing jobs and food. Yet those in power seemed more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the poor. At that point, only the richest landowners could vote, and large swathes of the country were not represented in Westminster. Manchester and Salford, which then had a population of 150,000, had no MP, yet Oxford and Cambridge Universities had their own representation. At the time the extension of the vote to all men, let alone women, was actively opposed by many who thought the vote should be restricted to those of influence and means. Why is Peterloo important? It paved the way for parliamentary democracy and particularly the Great Reform Act of 1832 which created new parliamentary seats, particularly in the industrial towns of the north of England. It also led to the establishment two years later of the Manchester Guardian by John Edward Taylor, a 28-year-old English journalist who was present at the massacre and saw how the “establishment” media sought to discredit the protesters.

Taylor’s relentless effort to tell the full story of Peterloo strengthened his own reformist political views – and he became determined to agitate for fair representation in parliament. He decided to start his own newspaper, the Manchester Guardian, with the financial backing of other middle-class radicals (10 put up £100 each, and an 11th contributed £50). The first edition was published on 5 May 1821, devoted to enlightenment values, liberty, reform and justice. It was launched with great confidence and optimism, by a man who believed that, “in spite of Peterloo and police spies, reason was great and would prevail”.

The Manchester Guardian was founded in a mood of great hope, and faith in ordinary people. The manifesto that Taylor produced before the paper’s launch speaks powerfully of the “great diffusion of Education” that was taking place, and “the greatly increased interest which political subjects excite, and the immense extension of the circle within which they are discussed. It is of the utmost importance that this increased interest should be turned to beneficial account”.

It is a powerful document, and one whose ideals still shape the Guardian – a celebration of more people getting educated, of more people engaging in politics, from different walks of life, from poorer communities. And it is a document that articulates a sense of responsibility to the public – that the Manchester Guardian could engage with the people who were starting to become involved in politics, giving them the information they need to take action. It is a wholly uncynical and unsnobbish document. It is on people’s side.

In the decades following Taylor’s death in 1844, the Manchester Guardian began to drift from the political ideals that had inspired its founding. It was highly profitable, but in becoming so it got too close to the Manchester cotton merchants who paid for the advertising that supported the paper. It even sided with the slave-owning south in the American civil war: the paper demanded that the Manchester cotton workers who starved in the streets because they refused to touch cotton picked by American slaves should be forced back into work. (Abraham Lincoln wrote to the “working men of Manchester” in 1863 to thank them for their “sublime Christian heroism, which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country”.)

This period of complacency for the Guardian was dramatically ended by the appointment as editor of CP Scott, who transformed the paper and helped establish the political commitments that have been so important to its identity ever since.

Scott was made editor in 1872, at the age of 25. He was a radical Liberal and party activist who cared greatly about social justice and pacifism. Scott faced two big ideological challenges during the 57 years of his editorship; and his response to both helped form the Guardian as it is today.

The first was the question of Irish Home Rule: on the most contentious issue of the time, which split the Liberal party in the 1880s, Scott campaigned for self-government in Ireland – marking the moment, according to the historian David Ayerst, when the Guardian most clearly became “a paper of the Left”. At the end of the 19th century, Scott took the Guardian to an even more controversial anti-colonial position. During the second Boer war, from 1899 to 1902, Britain was rampantly jingoistic; anyone who opposed the war was cast as a traitor. The Guardian stood against it and ran a campaign for peace, while the brilliant Guardian reporter Emily Hobhouse exposed the concentration camps for the Boers run by the British.

The paper’s stance was so controversial that it lost advertisers and one-seventh of its sales. One rival paper, confident that the Guardian was on the verge of collapse, sent a brass band to stand outside our offices in Cross Street, Manchester to play Handel’s mournful Dead March from Saul.

Scott’s courageous position nearly did kill the Guardian. But in standing up to the prevailing political mood of the day, Scott turned the newspaper into “the dominant expression of radical thinking among educated men and women”, as Ayerst wrote. “Clearly this was a paper that could not be bought.”

As Scott orientated the paper towards a more radical position – away from laissez-faire liberalism to what was known as “New Liberalism”, concerned with social justice and welfare – he set the Guardian on the progressive path it has maintained, with a few missteps, ever since.

One of those missteps came in 1948. Surprising as it may seem today, the Manchester Guardian disparaged the foundation of Britain’s National Health Service. While supporting the changes as a “great step forward”, the Guardian feared that the state providing welfare “risks an increase in the proportion of the less gifted”. Three years later, the paper went further and backed the Conservatives at the 1951 general election. (Historians believe that these decisions came about because the editor at the time, AP Wadsworth, loathed Nye Bevan, the passionate Labour politician behind the welfare state.)

Making sense of a political moment when you’re in the midst of it is difficult – even if you avoid commercial and personal conflicts, it can still be hard to see it and understand it. A news organisation might often get things wrong – it needs some core values and principles to stick to in order to try to get it right.

A month later, on 5 May 1821, John Edward Taylor publishes the first Manchester Guardian as a newspaper in the liberal interest. 1872 Charles Prestwich Scott, a liberal thinker with strong principles, becomes editor of the Guardian - a post he holds for 57 years. 1907 CP Scott buys the Guardian, becoming both owner and editor. 1921 CP Scott writes a leading article to mark the centenary of the paper that becomes recognised around the world as the blueprint for independent journalism and includes the line “Comment is free, but facts are sacred.” 1929 CP Scott retires as editor in favour of his son Ted. 1932​ CP Scott’s death in January is followed swiftly by that of his younger son; Ted Scott is killed in a tragic boating accident in April.

Many of these core values were laid out by Scott on the 100th birthday of the Guardian, with his justly celebrated centenary essay of 1921. It was here that Scott introduced the famous phrase “comment is free, but facts are sacred”, and decreed that “the voice of opponents no less than that of friends has a right to be heard”. It was here that he laid out the values of the Guardian: honesty, cleanness [integrity], courage, fairness, a sense of duty to the reader and a sense of duty to the community.

CP Scott’s essay, like John Edward Taylor’s foundational prospectus, is both powerful and hopeful; as Scott writes, “the newspaper has a moral as well as a material existence”.

Our moral conviction, as exemplified by Taylor and codified by Scott, rests on a faith that people long to understand the world they’re in, and to create a better one. We believe in the value of the public sphere; that there is such a thing as the public interest, and the common good; that we are all of equal worth; that the world should be free and fair.

These inspiring ideas have always been at the heart of the Guardian at its best – whether the paper is called the Manchester Guardian or the Guardian, the name it adopted in 1959 – and they are enshrined in our independent ownership structure, in which the Guardian is owned solely by the Scott Trust. Any money made must be spent on journalism. (The Observer, of course, has its own distinct and honourable history and perspective – and as part of the same company, we are close siblings, but not twins.)

This is the mission that has motivated so many of the great moments in Guardian history, from our independent reporting of the Spanish civil war to the dramatic Edward Snowden revelations; from taking an anti-colonial position in the Suez crisis to standing up to Rupert Murdoch, the police and politicians in the phone-hacking scandal; from sending Jonathan Aitken to jail to the Panama and Paradise Papers.

These values, beliefs and ideas are well-established and enduring. They do not, by themselves, tell us how to meet the moral urgency of this new era. The world we knew has been pulled out of shape, and we must ask what it means to uphold these values now – as journalists and as citizens – and how they will inform our journalism and purpose.

Almost 200 years have passed since the public meeting that sparked Peterloo. But the past three decades – since the invention of the world wide web in 1989 – have transformed our idea of the public in ways that John Edward Taylor and CP Scott could not have imagined.

This technological revolution was exciting and inspiring. After 600 years of the Gutenberg era, when mass communication was dominated by established and hierarchical sources of information, the web felt like a breath of fresh air: open, creative, egalitarian. As its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, put it, “this is for everyone”. At first, it felt like the beginning of a thrilling new era of hyper-connectivity, with all the world’s knowledge at our fingertips and every person empowered to participate – as if the internet was one big town square where all our problems could be solved and everyone helped each other.

While many news organisations saw the internet as a threat to the old hierarchies of authority, forward-looking editors like Alan Rusbridger, who led the Guardian from 1995 until 2015, embraced this hopeful new future for journalism, by investing in digital expansion – hiring engineers and product managers – and by understanding that journalists, in this new world, must be open to challenge and debate from their audience. From making the Guardian the first British news organisation to employ a readers’ editor to launching an opinion site that inverted the traditional model of top-down newspaper commentary, he put the Guardian at the forefront of digital innovation and the changed relationships of this new era. As I wrote four years ago in my essay The Rise of the Reader, the open web created genuinely new possibilities for journalism – and journalists who resisted the technological revolution would damage both their own interests and the interests of good journalism.

But it has become clear that the utopian mood of the early 2000s did not anticipate all that technology would enable. Our digital town squares have become mobbed with bullies, misogynists and racists, who have brought a new kind of hysteria to public debate. Our movements and feelings are constantly monitored, because surveillance is the business model of the digital age. Facebook has become the richest and most powerful publisher in history by replacing editors with algorithms – shattering the public square into millions of personalised news feeds, shifting entire societies away from the open terrain of genuine debate and argument, while they make billions from our valued attention.

This shift presents big challenges for liberal democracy. But it presents particular problems for journalism.

The transition from print to digital did not initially change the basic business model for many news organisations – that is, selling advertisements to fund the journalism delivered to readers. For a time, it seemed that the potentially vast scale of an online audience might compensate for the decline in print readers and advertisers. But this business model is currently collapsing, as Facebook and Google swallow digital advertising; as a result, the digital journalism produced by many news organisations has become less and less meaningful.

Publishers that are funded by algorithmic ads are locked in a race to the bottom in pursuit of any audience they can find – desperately binge-publishing without checking facts, pushing out the most shrill and most extreme stories to boost clicks. But even this huge scale can no longer secure enough revenue.

On some sites, journalists who learned in training that “news is something that someone, somewhere doesn’t want published” churn out 10 commodified stories a day without making a phone call. “Where once we had propaganda, press releases, journalism, and advertising,” the academic Emily Bell has written, “we now have ‘content’.” Readers are overwhelmed: bewildered by the quantity of “news” they see every day, nagged by intrusive pop-up ads, confused by what is real and what is fake, and confronted with an experience that is neither useful nor enjoyable.

How technology disrupted the truth | Katharine Viner Read more

Many people get most of their news from Facebook, which means that information arrives in one big stream – which may contain fact-based independent journalism from transparent sources alongside invented stories from a click farm, or content funded by malevolent actors to influence an election. The Richmond Standard, a website in California’s Bay Area, describes itself as a “community-driven daily news source”. If you see one of its headlines in your news feed, you couldn’t possibly know that it is owned by the multinational oil giant Chevron – which, according to the Financial Times, also owns “the Richmond refinery that in August 2012 caught fire, spewing plumes of black smoke over the city and sending more than 15,000 residents to hospital for medical help”. Such arrangements are no longer remarkable: the Australian Football League employs about 30 journalists to write friendly stories. Many free local newspapers in the UK are funded by the very councils they should be holding to account. It is asking a lot of individuals to sift the real from the fake when they are bombarded by information – how do they know who to trust?

Trust in all kinds of established institutions – including the media – is at an historic low. This is not a blip, and it should not be a surprise, when so many institutions have failed the people who trusted them and responded to criticism with contempt. As a result, people feel outraged but powerless – nothing they do seems to stop these things happening, and nobody seems to be listening to their stories.

This has created a crisis for public life, and particularly for the press, which risks becoming wholly part of the same establishment that the public no longer trusts. At a moment when people are losing faith in their ability to participate in politics and make themselves heard, the media can play a critical role in reversing that sense of alienation.

“If mistrust in institutions is changing how people participate in civics, news organisations might need to change as well,” the MIT professor Ethan Zuckerman has argued. “We could rethink our role as journalists as helping people … find the places where they, individually and collectively, can be the most effective and powerful.”

To do this well, journalists must work to earn the trust of those they aim to serve. And we must make ourselves more representative of the societies we aim to represent. Members of the media are increasingly drawn from the same, privileged sector of society: this problem has actually worsened in recent decades. According to the government’s 2012 report on social mobility in the UK, while most professions are still “dominated by a social elite”, journalism lags behind medicine, politics and even law in opening its doors to people from less well-off backgrounds. “Indeed,” the report concludes, “journalism has had a greater shift towards social exclusivity than any other profession.”

This matters because people from exclusive, homogenous backgrounds are unlikely to know anyone adversely affected by the crises of our era, or to spend time in the places where they are happening. Media organisations staffed largely by people from narrow backgrounds are less likely to recognise the issues that people notice in their communities every day as “news”; the discussions inside such organisations will inevitably be shaped by the shared privilege of the participants.

After 71 people died in the devastating Grenfell Tower fire in west London – which residents had forewarned for years – the Channel 4 News presenter Jon Snow said that the failure to attend to these warnings showed that the media was “comfortably with the elite, with little awareness, contact or connection with those not of the elite.” As Gary Younge, the Guardian editor-at-large, has put it: “‘They’ are not ‘us’ – ‘their’ views are not often heard in newsrooms, and they know it.”

If journalists become distant from other people’s lives, they miss the story, and people don’t trust them. The Guardian is not at all exempt from these challenges, and our staff is not diverse enough. Because of our history, values and purpose, we are committed to addressing these issues – but there is still a long way to go.

Meanwhile, those in power have exploited distrust of the media to actively undermine the role of journalism in the public interest in a democracy – from Donald Trump calling the “fake news” media “the enemy of the American people” to a British cabinet member suggesting that broadcasters should be “patriotic” in their Brexit reporting. All over the world – in Turkey, Russia, Poland, Egypt, China, Hungary, Malta and many other countries – powerful interests are on the march against free speech. Journalists are undermined, attacked, even murdered.

In these disorientating times, championing the public interest – which has always been at the heart of the Guardian’s mission – has become an urgent necessity. People are understandably anxious in the face of crises that are global, national, local and personal. At the global level, these crises are overwhelming: climate change, the refugee crisis, the rise of a powerful super-rich who bestride the global economy. It is easy to feel that humanity is facing a great shift, about which we were not consulted. Overwhelming technological, environmental, political and social change has precipitated what the philosopher Timothy Morton memorably describes as “a traumatic loss of co-ordinates” for all of us.

These global upheavals have plainly destabilised national politics, producing the shocks and surprises of the past two years: the unexpected result of the Brexit referendum, which leaves Britain facing a deeply uncertain future; the stunning election of Donald Trump; the collapse of support for traditional parties across Europe, and the unexpected rise of Emmanuel Macron. These events confounded the experts and the insiders who confidently declared them impossible. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn appeared to have torn up the rulebook that had governed electoral politics for two decades – finding a surge of support in the June snap election, particularly with young people, by promoting socialist ideas that had long been dismissed. Bernie Sanders tapped into a similar mood in the US Democratic primary.

Skyrocketing inequality between the rich and poor has bred resentment at the political and economic establishment. In October it was revealed that the world’s super-rich now hold the greatest concentration of wealth for 120 years – many of them taking elaborate steps to avoid tax in the process, as the Paradise Papers showed.

Paradise Papers leak reveals secrets of the world elite's hidden wealth Read more

What is becoming clear is that the way things have been run is unsustainable. We are at a turning point in which, in writer Naomi Klein’s words, “the spell of neoliberalism has been broken, crushed under the weight of lived experience and a mountain of evidence”. (Klein defines neoliberalism as “shorthand for an economic project that vilifies the public sphere”.) Perhaps the markets don’t have all the answers after all. The Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf, who says that many had not understood how “radical the implications” of worsening inequality would be, suggests that the political backlash to globalisation could possibly produce a “fundamental transformation of the world – at least as significant as the one that brought about the first world war and the Russian revolution.”

In many local areas, in our neighbourhoods and our communities, we see the collapse of civic life, from public space sold off cheaply to developers to the closing of libraries to the underfunding of schools and hospitals. It is not hard to imagine what has produced the growing tide of resentment that has shaken our politics. It is painful to see the rich getting away with it in the big cities while you’re struggling in your small town. Older people lament the loss of community life; younger people are unlikely to be able to find a good job or afford somewhere decent to live.

All of these dislocations have led to another set of crises at a personal level. This year, the World Health Organisation announced that cases of depression had ballooned in the past decade, making it the leading cause of disability worldwide. Loneliness is now being recognised as an epidemic throughout the west.

Our lives are increasingly atomised, but you can see the pleasure that comes from communal or civic participation. People long to help each other, to be together, to share experiences, to be part of a community, to influence the powers that control their lives. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
102,102,Trump Urges Georgia Governor to Strengthen Recount,['Charlie Spiering'],"President Donald Trump on Monday warned Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) of a “goldmine of fraud” without signature matching for mail-in ballots in the state recount.

“Why won’t Governor Brian Kemp, the hapless Governor of Georgia, use his emergency powers, which can be easily done, to overrule his obstinate Secretary of State, and do a match of signatures on envelopes,” Trump asked, referring to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R).

Trump channeled anger from Georgia state Republicans about the election results and the subsequent hand recounts that did not revisit the signature verification.

“Georgia Republicans are angry, all Republicans are angry. Get it done!” he wrote.

Raffensperger has claimed that matching the signatures is no longer possible because the ballots have been separated from the outer envelope.

But Trump argued that verifying the signatures in the recount would eliminate any potential fraud — both in the 2020 election and the Georgia Senate runoff election.

“It will be a ‘goldmine’ of fraud, and we will easily WIN the state,” Trump wrote.

The president also questioned whether the number of envelopes matched up with the number of ballots cast in the Georgia 2020 election, suggesting there were other signs of fraud.

“Also, quickly check the number of envelopes versus the number of ballots,” he wrote. “You may just find that there are many more ballots than there are envelopes. So simple, and so easy to do.”",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,13,"The Grand Tour stars on pirate treasure, cycle lanes and electric cars",[],"The Grand Tour stars on pirate treasure, cycle lanes and electric cars By Steven McIntosh

Entertainment reporter Published duration 17 hours ago

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption It took real boules to film some scenes in the new Madagascar special

Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May attempt to find pirate treasure in their new special, The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt.

The trio head to Madagascar for their latest Amazon film, with little more than a car each and a historical treasure map.

The challenge starts with the tale of an 18th Century pirate known as La Buse (The Buzzard). Legend has it that, before he died, he buried his treasure - worth £100m in today's money - somewhere in the Seychelles.

When he was finally captured and executed in 1730, he hurled a piece of parchment into the crowd, shouting: ""My treasure for he who can understand!""

image copyright Getty Images image caption La Buse (left), who was executed in 1730, and his tomb on the French island of La Reunion

The parchment contained a 17-line cryptogram which apparently revealed where his treasure was buried... but only if someone was able to decipher it.

Many have tried and failed over the centuries to locate the loot. We've been speaking to Clarkson, Hammond and May about their own hunt (and a few other things in between).

1. Some were more hopeful about finding the treasure than others

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Hammond was the most optimistic of the group about genuinely finding the treasure

In the course of the 90-minute special, May makes a decent and serious attempt to crack the codes. Which raises the question, did the team ever think they might actually discover the treasure?

""Yes! I did all along,"" says the lovably enthusiastic Hammond. ""I'm a massive fan of all of that stuff. It's historical fact that a lot of these people did exist, as did their treasure. So you never know, there was a chance.""

Executive producer Andy Wilman has a slightly different reaction when we put the same question to him.

""Are you mentally deranged?"" he asks us, which we'll take as a no.

""I'll tell you what it did do, it made you a kid again. I'm getting paid to hunt for buried treasure, like I'm seven. It's one of those situations where your tongue has got to come through your cheek. So the viewer can see [we know] that this is nonsense. But you go with it because of the journey, it's a great adventure to go on.""

2. The title (surprisingly) wasn't their idea

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption A Massive Hunt was filmed prior to the coronavirus pandemic

You might have thought that the team would have a hard time topping the name of last year's special, The Grand Tour presents: Seamen, which saw the trio swap cars for boats. But they've outdone themselves here.

So whose idea was The Grand Tour presents: A Massive Hunt?

""You won't believe me when I tell you, but it was the people we work for,"" reveals Wilman. ""Old big corporate Amazon.

""We were batting titles backwards and forwards and it was like 'best one wins'. And then I got a text from their head of marketing and I was like, 'oh yeah, game over, our work is done now'.""

3. Madagascar: Worse than Swindon

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption May says he's never driven on a road as difficult as this one in Madagascar

Perhaps the most gripping section of the new special comes when the trio have to find their way along a road in Madagascar - although the word ""road"" is being rather generous.

""It's extraordinary that it's actually marked on a map as a thing you can drive a vehicle on,"" says a bewildered Clarkson. ""I'm not surprised the Madagascans threw the French out if that was their idea of a road, because it just isn't one.""

May admits: ""In terms of trying to get your car to the end, we honestly thought near the beginning of filming that we simply weren't going to be able to do it.

""I've never driven on a road that difficult to simply negotiate. It's worse than the centre of Swindon, with all those mini roundabouts. You could spend the rest of your life there if you're not careful.""

4. Clarkson remains unconvinced by electric cars

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption Clarkson woke up to the issue of climate change last year - but hasn't changed his lifestyle

You may remember Clarkson publicly acknowledged climate change for the first time in last year's special, after the awful conditions the team witnessed in Cambodia. But that doesn't mean he's about to change his behaviour.

""I've just ordered a new Bentley, with a V8 engine, so that's where I stand,"" he says. ""[Hammond and May] both have electric cars now but I'm carbon offsetting them.""

He refers to recent reports of ""appalling"" child slavery in the Democratic Republic of Congo, after the huge surge in demand for cobalt - a critical metal for electric car batteries.

""They're also very expensive and completely impractical and have the personality of a vacuum cleaner but if that's what you like, help yourself to an electric car.""

5. And it's probably best you don't mention cycle lanes to him either

image copyright PA Media image caption More cycle lanes have sprung up in London this year as a way to avoid public transport

...because it sounds like he had quite a traumatic experience travelling to the press launch.

""It took me three hours to get to where I am this morning, because the Mayor of London is an imbecile,"" he says with his usual tact. ""He's just turned the whole damn city into a cycle lane.

""I don't mind one or two cycle lanes where it's convenient but he's put one in the Euston underpass. I mean, the man's a maniac and must be stopped.""

Clarkson has always enjoyed being provocative with the things he says, but we thought we'd better put these comments to the Mayor of London.

A spokesman for Sadiq Khan told us: ""London is facing an air quality crisis which is causing thousands of deaths per year and exacerbating the physical effects of Covid-19. Half of toxic emissions in the city are caused by road transport.

""These policies are about saving lives and Sadiq makes no apologies for the temporary emergency measures he has put in place to encourage the huge increase in cycling we've seen since the pandemic began which is also enabling social distancing on public transport. We mustn't get through one public health crisis only to face another caused by congestion and toxic air pollution.""

6. The team hope viewers might fancy a crack

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption James May encourages viewers to try to crack the cryptogram, which is available online

After the special is released next month, James May hopes it will prompt renewed interest with the public in finding the treasure.

""The coded message is available in various books and online, and there are many ways of reading it and interpreting it, as I hope I showed, but if other people want to have a crack at it, I think that would be very interesting,"" he says.

""Even if you did manage to translate it, it would be in an old language which we're not very familiar with, so getting all the way through to what it actually means is going to require massive research knowledge and interpretative skills. But even if it's just for a bit of fun, I hope people still have a go at it, it's quite absorbing actually.""

7. The next special will be in Scotland

Wilman describes having to edit the Madagascar film over Zoom as ""a living hell"".

Lockdown also meant the team had to get creative when they began filming their next special, and find something to do within the UK.

""We were trying to think of different options, and where we ended up was we just shot one recently up in Scotland, a kind of mini coronavirus special, which will be 60-odd minutes rather than 90,"" Wilman explains

image copyright Amazon Studios image caption All three Grand Tour stars got their own deal for a solo show when they signed with Amazon

But how much longer will the trio continue doing The Grand Tour? They've been with Amazon since 2015, and were on Top Gear for 13 years before that.

""I am aware of ageing, and perhaps the need to grow up, now I'm in the second half of my 50s,"" says May. ""But I think we'll do it for a bit yet because, to be honest, people want us to, and it would be wrong of us to disappoint them.

""But eventually one of us is going to snap, yes. Probably me. I'm quite fragile, really.""

Wilman explains that he and the trio all got individual solo deals when they signed with Amazon, which meant each was given their own series in addition to working on The Grand Tour.

As a result, Clarkson has done a farming series, Hammond has a forthcoming survivalist show, while James May recently launched his own cookery programme. ""I've still got one to do,"" Wilman says, although adds that he'll remain behind the scenes rather than on screen.

""We'd like to do two [Grand Tour specials] a year, that was the plan. We've still got two to do, on our current contract. And that's about right, two allows us to do other things, and keep Grand Tour going.""",BBC,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

65,65,Boris Faces Massive Tory Rebellion over Coronavirus Restrictions,['Victoria Friedman'],"Boris Johnson is facing a rebellion of up to 100 Conservative MPs planning to vote against putting 99 per cent of England under the top two strictest coronavirus measures.

The prime minister’s proposals from last week revealed that despite England being under a month-long lockdown during November, more of the country will find itself in a higher tier coming out of shutdown than going in, with just Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight in Tier 1.

Conservative MPs were outraged by the recommended demarcations, calling the measures “authoritarian”, with others saying that the “wheels are coming off the government’s arguments” to continue imposing them.

14.6 million more people in England are now in Tier 3 compared to pre-lockdown, when cases were also falling. Meanwhile, non-Covid deaths at home are rising way above the 5 year average as many are too scared or unable to get to hospital. Lockdowns don’t work. pic.twitter.com/wtNDkMJjli — The Brexit Party (@brexitparty_uk) November 29, 2020

MPs are set to vote on the measures in the House of Commons today, with media reporting that as many as between 50 and 100 Tories will rebel against their own government and vote against them, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential backbench 1922 Committee.

The Guardian has also reported that Labour plans to abstain from voting, because the financial support, derived from taxpayers, for the hospitality industry must go further than the government’s recovery package.

Tier 2 bans socialising indoors with anyone outside their house or support bubble and limits it to six outdoors, while Tier 3 prohibits any mixing with people not in your household or bubble inside or in most outdoor settings. Tier 3 also sees pubs, bars, and restaurants close unless they can function as takeaways, while in Tier 2, alcohol at hospitality venues can only be served with a ‘substantial meal’.

Conservative lockdown sceptics from the COVID Recovery Group won a minor battle in forcing the Johnson administration to release the impact assessments that informed the government’s decision, but MPs are said to be disappointed with the document, described as “thin” and containing a “rehashed” and frustrating analysis.

UK Minister: You Might Be Banned from Venues Without Vaccine Passport https://t.co/f0UOh7YnkY — Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) December 1, 2020

Chairman of the Covid Recovery Group, Mark Harper, said: “Even with so little time, the government’s analysis seems to be collapsing under the glare of scrutiny.

“Before the current lockdown, incorrect death and hospital capacity modelling was leaked into the public domain to justify it. We asked for full details. We have asked repeatedly for the information that vindicates these hospital projections, and they have not been forthcoming.

“We are now seeing that, once again, the wheels are coming off the government’s arguments.”

Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith called the document a “cut and paste job”, insinuating that the government had provided no new analysis at all.

However, despite the anticipated massive Tory rebellion and Labour abstaining, the proposals are expected to pass with support from the Conservative “payroll vote” government ministers and Johnson loyalists in the backbench, as well as a handful of Labour MPs defying Sir Keir Starmer.",BreitBart,-1,,,,,,,,,,,,
196,196,PolitiFact Admits Bogus Facebook Fact Check After Candace Owens Challenges ‘False’ Rating,['Alana Mastrangelo'],"Facebook “fact-checker” PolitiFact was forced to issue a correction after conservative commentator Candace Owens challenged the “false” rating tacked on to a recent video she posted about former Vice President Joe Biden.

“Correction: PolitiFact originally labeled this video false in our capacity as a third-party fact-checker for Facebook,” PolitiFact announced last week.

“On Nov. 20, an appeal to that decision was made on behalf of Ms. Owens. PolitiFact approved the appeal on Nov. 20, determined that a correction was appropriate, and removed the false rating,” the statement added.

“Anybody who understands politics, who passed a basic level of civics knows that right now, in this moment, Joe Biden is literally and legally not the president-elect,” said Owens in her video that was falsely “fact-checked” by PolitiFact.

“This information cannot be fact-checked, because that is the truth, so they cannot take that off, they cannot censor that. It is a fact,” continued Owens in her video.

In August, Owens announced that she would be suing Facebook over its “blatant censorship” after the social media platform demonetized her page following her comments about senator Kamala Harris (D-CA) swearing into congress in 2017 as an “Indian-American.”

“I am SO EXCITED that we get to watch [Kamala Harris], who swore into congress as an ‘Indian-American’, now play the ‘I’m a black a woman’ card all the way until November,” Owens had quipped on social media. “Fun times!”

At the time, Owens told Breitbart News that Big Tech “censorship issue is real and we haven’t done enough to fight it as conservatives.”

“All they [fact checkers] have to do is find one opposite opinion, and they can give you a false rating,” Owens explained. “You have to send a legal letter every time to get it reversed.”

Owens took to Twitter on Saturday to celebrate her first victory in the case against the social media giant.

“Weeks ago, @Facebook censored a post of mine which truthfully stated that @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect. So I got lawyers involved. Conclusion? @PolitiFact uncensored the post & admitted that they LIED by rating my post false. The fact-checkers are lying for Democrats,” tweeted Owens.

At 8 Months pregnant, I unfortunately cannot fight on the ground alongside patriots like I am used to, but I am taking every measure to fight these communists in the court room. It is my goal to expose these lying “fact-checkers” one by one. @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect. pic.twitter.com/hW4NLpK4tc — Candace Owens (@RealCandaceO) November 28, 2020

“At 8 Months pregnant, I unfortunately cannot fight on the ground alongside patriots like I am used to, but I am taking every measure to fight these communists in the court room,” she added. “It is my goal to expose these lying ‘fact-checkers’ one by one. @JoeBiden is NOT the President-elect.”

Owens also said that she has retained lawyers, including attorney Todd McMurtry, who was on the legal team representing former Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann.

“It is time to fact-check the fact-checkers,” said Owens. “I’m going to put these suckers through discovery and figure out what the relationship is that they have with Facebook.”

The conservative firebrand added that she has also launched a website called “Fact-Check Zuck,” which people can visit to help support her legal efforts in taking on Facebook’s fact-checkers.

“Our freedoms are being stripped away. The overlords of Big Tech are determining what Americans can and cannot say, share, like, and post,” the site reads. “Support our legal efforts today as we fight back against Facebook’s fact-checkers, confronting those who are suppressing free speech, thought, and expression across our great country.”

867,867,World is ‘doubling down’ on fossil fuels despite climate crisis – UN report,[],"The world’s governments are “doubling down” on fossil fuels despite the urgent need for cuts in carbon emissions to tackle the climate crisis, a report by the UN and partners has found.

The researchers say production of coal, oil and gas must fall by 6% a year until 2030 to keep global heating under the 1.5C target agreed in the Paris accord and avoid “severe climate disruption”. But nations are planning production increases of 2% a year and G20 countries are giving 50% more coronavirus recovery funding to fossil fuels than to clean energy.

The Covid-19 pandemic is expected to cut production in 2020 by 7%, the report says, but this barely changes the total production expected by 2030. Countries are on track to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels consistent with a 1.5C limit by that date.

The challenge of deliberately cutting fossil fuel production every year by similar amounts to that forced by a global pandemic lockdown is large. But a managed wind-down can help repair the global economic damage by creating many new clean energy jobs, the researchers say.

“The pandemic-driven plunge in oil prices this year has once again demonstrated the vulnerability of many fossil-fuel-dependent regions and communities,” said Ivetta Gerasimchuk, at the International Institute for Sustainable Development and a lead author of the report.

“Alas, in 2020 we saw many governments doubling down on fossil fuels. Instead of governments letting these fossil fuel projects die, they resurrect them from death – it’s kind of zombie energy.”

Inger Andersen, the head of the UN environment programme (Unep), said: “With governments injecting trillions into their economies, we find ourselves at a critical juncture where decisions can either further lock in fossil fuel energy systems or transition us to a cleaner and safer future. This year’s devastating forest fires, floods, and droughts serve as powerful reminders for why we must succeed.”

“The research is abundantly clear that we face severe climate disruption if countries continue to produce fossil fuels at current levels, let alone at their planned increases,” said Michael Lazarus, at the Stockholm Environment Institute and another author of the report.

The Production Gap report says G20 governments have committed more than $230bn (£173bn) in Covid-19-related funding to fossil fuel production and consumption to date, far more than the $150bn to clean energy. But it found that between 2020 and 2030, global coal, oil, and gas production must fall by 11%, 4%, and 3% a year respectively, to meet the 1.5C target.

The assessment of future fossil fuel production is based on the most recent published energy plans by eight key countries that produce 60% of the world’s fossil fuels: Australia, Canada, China, India, Indonesia, Norway, Russia and the US.

The report also sets out how policymakers can start a gradual decline in production, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and supporting affected communities into new jobs.

“It’s a matter of recognising that fossil fuels are no longer the economic powerhouse they used to be, and I think we’re beginning to see that happen,” said Lazarus. Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders and a former UN climate envoy, said: “Working together, governments, companies and investors can bring forward a managed decline in a way that minimises disruption and ensures a just transition for workers and communities.”

Niklas Hagelberg, at Unep, said: “Governments are injecting trillions of dollars into their economies – this is money borrowed from future generations. If we keep on investing into fossil fuels, we’re going to give our children not only a planet in its worst state, but also wasted money.”

The report has prompted a coalition of NGOs, including Global Witness, Friends of the Earth and Carbon Tracker, to write to the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, who will host a critical UN climate summit in November 2021, calling on him to “show climate leadership” by announcing the UK would abandon its policy of maximising the economic recovery of its oil and gas reserves.

The letter adds: “The world – and its people – are looking to the UK for climate leadership. We must not fail them.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

764,764,‘Our customers want us to go green’: the rise of sustainable hair salons,[],"Small changes such as eco shower heads can make big saving for salons. Photograph: Westend61/Getty Images

Running a successful salon is challenging at the best of times, so it stands to reason that sustainability is not always front of mind. It certainly wasn’t something Dan Mewies, owner of Mewies & Co in Charnwood, Leicestershire, thought much about until he relaunched his business a year ago. “I think it was my children,” he says, about making the decision to be more environmentally friendly. “As they’ve gotten older, they’ve become a lot more knowledgeable and have encouraged me to do a bit more.”

In the salon’s new location, Mewies added eco shower heads to reduce the amount of water used, and replaced his cotton towels with biodegradable ones. There’s a recycling station and stylists are encouraged to do more hand-dyeing to reduce the amount of foil or mesh used when colouring. He’s also planning to add a product refill station before the end of the year. The new salon promotes a healthy lifestyle, with a yoga studio, and reiki and acupuncture practitioners offering treatments, and stocks Schwarzkopf Professional and Authentic Beauty Concept product ranges.

It has been an investment, Mewies says, both in terms of the initial financial outlay and time spent getting the whole team on board. But he’s already finding the salon is using a lot less electricity and water, and there’s been no need to install a large washing machine and dryer. The business has also picked up new customers who have heard about the changes. “It’s added a real buzz to the salon,” he says. “[Clients] feel they’re doing their bit without having to do too much. They can go and tell their friends they go to a salon that is environmentally friendly. And I think my staff are happier. They are working somewhere that really cares about them and what’s going on [in the world].”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mewies & Co has invested in a range of measures become more environmentally friendly

With more than 43,000 hair and beauty businesses in the UK, employing 250,000 people, hairdressers who embrace small steps such as these can make a big difference, Denise Baden, professor of sustainable business at the University of Southampton, says. As part of her research, which began in 2012, Baden founded the Eco Hair and Beauty initiative, offering tips to salon owners and publishing an eco salon directory. She also launched a free sustainable salon certification and training programme, which has worked with more than 2,000 stylists so far. “A big turning point was David Attenborough’s The Blue Planet,” she says, about the growing awareness of the importance of sustainability. “I had a lot of hairdressers get in touch and say: ‘Our customers want us to go green.’”

While there is often an initial expense, making changes such as using tepid water instead of hot, shampooing hair once rather than twice, and installing eco shower heads can save the average four-seater salon more than £5,000 a year. “There are sometimes tensions between trying to be sustainable and making a profit, but we’ve found a lot of win-wins,” Baden says. “[Hairdressers] are in a good position to make a big difference not just in terms of changing their own habits, but in how they affect their clients’ behaviour. They’re connected to more networks of people than any other occupation, and are a trusted source of information.”

Encouraging hairdressers to be catalysts for change is one of the projects Kai Görlitz leads at the consumer goods company Henkel, as part of his role in social initiatives and sustainability for Schwarzkopf Professional, one of Henkel’s brands. “We truly believe that hairdressers are uniquely placed to be sustainability advocates and act as role models through the practices they model in their salons,” he says.

That vision for a sustainable world extends beyond the environment into helping disadvantaged young people into jobs. To that end, Görlitz works as the global project manager for Schwarzkopf’s Shaping Futures programme, which trains young people to become hairstylists and is run in partnership with both global non-governmental organisations (NGO), such as SOS Children’s Villages, as well as a variety of local NGOs.

The initiative, launched 10 years ago, was the brainchild of Simon Ellis, international creative director at Schwarzkopf, who was inspired after going on a business trip to Japan in 2008, where he was introduced to a training project carried out with Cambodian street children. Since then, more than 2,500 underprivileged young people, across 30 countries, have been taught to become hairdressers. “Hairdressing is a skill, a craft – it’s teachable,” Ellis says. “So we take hairdressers who are passionately willing to deliver and put them together with underprivileged young adults who want to learn, giving them the opportunity of creating a career.” Ellis recently met one of the volunteer trainers again in Japan. “She ran up to me, burst into tears, put her arms around me and said: ‘You’ve changed my life.’ It’s wonderful.”

More than half of the students who complete the training, which includes lessons in cutting, colouring, styling, and consultation, go on to get a paid internship, apprenticeship, or permanent job placement immediately after the programme. Introducing trainees to potential employers is a key part of the process, Ellis says. “I felt there was no point creating a training programme that would not allow that individual to then get a job.” Many will go on to set up their own businesses – Manashi, an orphan from India who had never been outside of her own village, now has her own salon in Chennai; and Son, who was abandoned in Vietnam at the age of 13, has set up his own business back in his hometown, after working at a salon in Ho Chi Minh City.

“He said that it’s such a rewarding feeling for him to be able to create job opportunities himself now for other young people in his community,” Görlitz says of Son. “In 2018, he returned to Shaping Futures as a trainer in his own right.” And while the Covid-19 pandemic has meant any international programmes have had to be put on hold, Görlitz has found the sector is still interested in giving back. Henkel’s Hairdressers United fundraiser event is one example of this. “Shaping Futures creates a global sense of community and togetherness, and we have noticed our volunteers still want to continue to support our cause. Although travel restrictions will likely mean that focus is going to be on a more local level, our programme has also already catered for this in the past and we see it more as a shift in focus, rather than a turning point. Social disadvantage exists everywhere and with the help of our dedicated hairdresser clients we will continue to create that sense of excitement in youngsters across the globe and show them that a world of opportunity is out there in the industry.”

As challenging as the pandemic has been for the hair and beauty industry, Ellis says he’s felt uplifted by the recognition the sector has recently received. “For the first time ever, we’ve heard people say on primetime news that the thing they missed the most [during lockdown] was their hairdresser. That’s incredible. There’s been huge positivity in the industry since lockdown has eased. There is this sense of being valued.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of Monday’s non-fatal shootings involved two moving vehicles “in the 4800 block of West Patterson Avenue” around 7:15 p.m. As the vehicles passed one another an occupant from one opened fire, striking a 30-year-old and a 41-year-old in the other vehicle.

The 30-year-old “was struck in the face and shoulder” while the 41-year-old “was struck in the arm and head.”

Monday’s violence follows a weekend in which 28 were shot, seven fatally, in Mayor Lightfoot’s Chicago.

Breitbart News reported 50 people were shot last weekend in Mayor Lighfoot’s Chicago, and five of those shooting victims succumbed to their wounds. Twenty-three people were shot on Monday, November 16, 2020, alone, and that Monday followed a weekend in which over 20 were shot, one fatally, in the city.

Five people were shot, including a 16-year-old boy, on Thanksgiving Day, in Mayor Lighfoot’s Chicago.

Community testing is being seen as a crucial development to get the UK through winter until the vaccines arrive.

This refers to the use of rapid testing to spot asymptomatic cases – people who do not have symptoms.

It is what the government was referring to as the ""moonshot"" programme a few months ago.

Local authorities are being given access to these tests to try to root out the virus among people who do not know they have it.

It was one of the tools that Liverpool has used over the past month or so, during which infection levels have been reduced three-fold.

Councils across the country are likely to offer it to people in neighbourhoods with high infection rates and to target high-risk workplaces like food factories.

Nationally it is being used to test care home visitors and help university students return home for Christmas.

But despite the optimism among ministers, there are words of caution.

These tests were never intended for community use like this. When used by untrained people they may only spot half of positive cases.

165,165,"GOP Rep. Stefanik: Pelosi Losing Leverage, Controlled by the Far-Left in AOC",['Jeff Poor'],"Tuesday on FNC’s “Fox & Friends,” Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) laid out a dynamic in the House of Representatives as the White House, and the Senate Republicans worked to hammer out an agreement with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on a COVID-19 relief package.

According to Stefanik, Pelosi’s grip on the control of the House was slipping as more so-called progressive Democrats, like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), were on the rise.

“I think Mitch is exactly right. Speaker Pelosi has walked away again and again and again from negotiations,” she said. “There are a number of provisions that we agree on. For example, additional aid to small businesses who are continuing to suffer, particularly as we head into this holiday and retail season. Direct support for K-12 schools. That legislation would be signed into law today or yesterday if Speaker Pelosi would negotiate in good faith. Instead, she played politics leading up to the election, and she lost.”

“She lost every single toss-up seat in the country,” Stefanik continued. “Republicans have picked up numerous seats, and we’re continuing to pick them with an Iowa House seat and a California House seat. She is losing her leverage by the day. And I think the reality is if she can get her votes for speaker, which is still an open question, she is controlled by the far-left in AOC. So she’s going to have to go to them to get their approval.”

718,718,Being cautious is the best thing you can do this Christmas,[],"Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas. This year we face the additional pressures of the pandemic and the government’s ambiguous Covid-19 Christmas guidance, which seems to encourage families and friends to meet in their homes and travel over a five-day period, while at the same time pushing the responsibility for those decisions on to individuals themselves. It’s both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn’t necessarily mean we ought to.

As a public health expert, I’ve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I’m torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression. While independent scientists are one of the few groups who can be unpopular and forthright, politicians are stuck in an unenviable dilemma: tell people what they need to hear based on the facts, or tell them what they want to hear based on emotion.

The truth is the virus that causes Covid-19 does not care that it is Christmas or New Year’s Eve. It rapidly spreads indoors and in poorly ventilated settings, particularly in households, when people gather together informally in comfortable and close conditions. Disinfecting surfaces and sitting 2 metres apart just isn’t going to stop transmission. It’s best to imagine the virus like cigarette smoke: if one person in the room is smoking, you’re likely to smell the smoke. It’s the same with this coronavirus: if one person is infected, you could also become infected from the aerosols emitted when they breathe and talk.

There are ways to exercise caution. If you want to safely see your family, you can check the local prevalence of Covid cases in the area – the number of cases per 100,000 people. If there are fewer cases and positive tests results, the risk of catching or passing on Covid-19 is lower. But of course there is always an element of risk. Socialising outdoors, going on walks and spending time in nature with friends and family are ways to see people in a less risky environment. So is connecting with family and friends virtually, on the phone or on Zoom.

If you are keen to spend time closely with family members indoors, especially vulnerable or elderly individuals, the only truly safe way to do so is to isolate for two weeks before seeing them, to ensure you’re not carrying the virus or incubating it. Private providers are now offering rapid Covid tests, but they’re not 100% safe because the virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days. You could test negative today, for example, and be infectious and test positive tomorrow. Two negative test results taken five to eight days apart is one way to help mitigate this risk, albeit an expensive one.

As the UK heads into a tiered system of restrictions, the government’s decision to relax travel measures over the festive period is particularly concerning. Movement from higher- to lower-prevalence areas means all tiers are more likely to be upgraded after Christmas, with the possibility of the entire country being in tier 3 by early 2021. The virus moves when people move; as data from the past 10 months has shown, restricting travel is an important way to protect areas from Covid.

With each passing day, we get nearer to effective and safe vaccines, treatments for Covid-19 patients, and effective mass testing. Indeed, next week, the first 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to be rolled out in the UK. Many people may decide that, with mass vaccinations on the horizon, the risk of being infected or infecting others over Christmas isn’t worth it. As someone in one of the lower risk groups, I’m less concerned about getting Covid-19 myself than I am worried about unintentionally infecting someone else, contributing to a chain of infections that could result in someone being hospitalised.

While we all clapped for months for the NHS staff, we should keep them in the forefront of our minds this winter. NHS doctors, nurses, support staff and cleaners have to show up each day to work in hospitals and GP practices and deal with whatever is thrown at them. Relying exclusively on the health service to fight this pandemic is like leaving a goalie alone on a football pitch. We all need to play our part in keeping the burden off health services. This might mean postponing group gatherings until the spring or summer next year, and doing our best now to avoid getting the virus and passing it on to others.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

240,240,How a vaccine could upend real estate markets -- again,[],"In just a matter of months the coronavirus pandemic dramatically changed the landscape of the housing market, especially in big cities. But now news of a promising vaccine could turn the market on its head again.

Nationally, home prices have never been higher , driven up as surging demand due to record low mortgage rates comes up against historically low inventory of homes for sale.

But the most expensive urban areas have been experiencing the opposite problem. Cities like New York and San Francisco have seen higher vacancy rates and lower rents and sale prices as many people, untethered from office jobs, retreated to the suburbs and less densely populated areas.

But with potential vaccines on the horizon, real estate in big cities could see a turnaround.

""It's not going to be a light switch,"" said Jonathan Miller, president of Miller Samuel, a real estate appraiser and consultant in New York City. ""But the news is starting to get people to be hopeful and think about returning to the city. Because right now, without a vaccine, it is status quo.""

While widespread vaccination is still a ways off , the news alone is a good sign that real estate in cities will continue to recover as the prospect of vaccines becomes more realistic, said Richard Smith, chairman and executive director of the Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a nonprofit that studies recurring patterns in economics, social sciences and nature.

""Sometimes it is when the news gets less bad that you get your biggest gains,"" he said.

Real estate investment trusts (REITs), investments backed by real estate, that had cratered when the pandemic broke out, have already recovered some of their losses and moved higher on the vaccine news.

Here's what the vaccine could mean for renters and home buyers.

Will people return to cities?

The more a vaccine brings life closer to ""normal,"" the more city real estate markets will change, said Miller.

""Once the vaccine is out and the population begins seeing schools reliably open and the big companies bringing people back in, that's where it snowballs,"" he said. ""Then people can make plans around it.""

In Manhattan, the rental market will come back first, he said, because that activity has fallen the most and there is a lower bar to entry. But with rental inventory currently triple what it was a year ago, don't expect rents to go up soon.

The Manhattan rental market remains historically weak. Last month saw a record-high number of apartments available to rent and a record-high share of rental apartments leased with concessions like one or two months free rent, according to brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and Miller Samuel.

The vacancy rate in Manhattan is at a new all-time high of 6.14%. That's caused record price declines in rents. The median rent for a one bedroom in Manhattan in October, for example, was $3,064 a month, down 4.1% from September and down 14.8% from a year ago.

""There has been a precipitous drop in the cost of a rental and the expectation is that there is still more of that ahead, until the inventory is eaten up,"" said Miller. ""There is still a lot of runway ahead. We'll be well into 2021 and a vaccine until we get into an uptick in pricing.""

For those looking to buy, purchasing a home in New York will be more attractive when a vaccine makes all the things a city has to offer possible again, Miller said, including easy access to dining, theater, concerts and events.

""The first thing that has to happen in terms of really accelerating the re-adoption of city life in the post-pandemic world, is going to be when companies, especially the Fortune 500 companies as leaders, start to bring people back to work,"" he said.

Buyers won't leave the suburbs behind

The uncertainty of this past year has left a mark on buyers, particularly those with higher incomes who can afford a second home near the city as a refuge that requires no planes or planning, said Dottie Herman, chief executive of Douglas Elliman Real Estate.

""The virus made the home very important,"" said Herman. ""Working from home will be here to stay, in some way. It won't be only working from home, but some combination of at home and the office.""

That has created wish lists for new homes that include outdoor space and offices and it has expanded locations for buyers, lengthening the commuting tether between home and office, she said.

Strong demand in the suburbs and resort communities near cities will continue, she said. Even though many suburban areas around New York passed their pandemic peak in the summer, in many areas sales are still above levels seen a year ago.

""People have gotten used to working from home and are comfortable living farther from the city,"" she said. ""That won't change with a vaccine. Second homes will continue to be a booming market nationally.""

Will mortgage rates stay low?

Mortgage interest rates hit a 12th all-time low heading into November, and some economists say even lower rates may be ahead. Others, however, say the vaccine news could reverse the downward trend.

""While rates are always unpredictable, sustained record lows are looking less likely in light of recent events,"" said Brendan Phillips, a capital markets analyst at Better.com, an online lender. ""Rates jumped when pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced its Covid-19 vaccine had shown 90% efficacy in trials .""

Goldman Sachs analysts pointed to the encouraging progress of vaccine research as a reason to think the economy may sustain a ""V-shaped"" recovery, bouncing back quickly to pre-pandemic levels. Other economists say that the ability of Congress to finally pass a stimulus package will also affect the speed of the country's recovery from the current recession.

""Good news for the economy, though, usually means higher rates,"" said Phillips.",CNN,1.0,,,,,,,,,,,,
582,582,France: teargas grenade that killed woman 'may have been fired directly at her flat',[],"A report into the death of an 80-year-old woman hit by a teargas grenade during a gilets jaunes demonstration in 2018 has suggested the police officer fired directly at her apartment.

Zineb Redouane was closing the shutters of her fourth floor flat in central Marseille when she was struck by the canister. Ballistic experts say it would have been travelling at more than 97 km/h when it smashed into her chest and face, causing devastating injuries.

Redouane died in hospital two years ago on Wednesday.

A subsequent French report cleared the police of any wrongdoing, concluding the incident had been an accident.

However, an investigation by the NGO Disclose, using reconstructions carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research group based at the University of London, contradicts the official report and suggests the officer who fired the canister had targeted residential homes.

The victim’s daughter has now lodged a legal complaint against Christophe Castaner, the interior minister at the time of her mother’s death.

In December 2018, gilets jaunes protesters demonstrating in Marseille city centre faced clouds of teargas used by the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS) riot police.

Algerian-born Redouane was at the bedroom window of her apartment at 7pm talking to her daughter Milfet on the telephone, when she was hit by an MP7-type teargas canister fired from a Cougar launcher, whose instructions for use specify: “Direct fire is strictly banned so people are not hit.”

The canister, with a range of 100 metres and designed to clear an area of 1,000 sq metres, exploded inside the small apartment, releasing a huge quantity of gas.

Redouane was taken to hospital but died on the operating table. A postmortem examination reported she had “fractures of the entire right hemifacial bone”. On the basis of photos of the victim and a provisional autopsy report, the experts concluded that the teargas grenade struck the victim’s chest first, before hitting her chin.

The official investigation revealed that five CRS officers had been issued with Cougar launchers and MP7 teargas grenades on the day of the demonstration. The CRS commander in charge of the police forces on the day refused to name the officers and none has admitted firing at Redouane’s apartment building.

French ballistic experts reported the teargas canister, fired from a distance of 37 metres, was travelling at around 97.2 km/h when it struck Redouane and concluded the officer who shot it had respected the rules.

Their 73-page report, published in May, concluded “the weapon was used according to the instructions and procedures for use currently employed by the national police”. It added: “There is no argument to suggest that Madame Redouane could have been seen by the police officer at the time he fired”, and concluded the grenade had “hit the victim in a completely accidental manner during its upward projection”.

Forensic Architecture examined CCTV, videos of the demonstration posted on social media as well as the official French report to create a 3D reconstruction of the incident.

It concluded from the position of the police officer who fired the teargas, the angle of fire and the trajectory that “there was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas”. It said it was working on a margin of error of 2 metres, but that there were only apartments in the direction the officer had fired.

“There was a strong possibility the grenade would enter an apartment and let off a large quantity of gas,” the Forensic Architecture report concluded, adding: “It was clear there was a danger at the time of the firing. The response of the shooter and their supervisor is clearly in question.”

Yassine Bouzrou, lawyer for the Redouane family told the Guardian he believed the police officer had deliberately targeted the 80-year-old. “She was at the window talking to her daughter on the phone via the loudspeaker while the police were confronting Gilets Jaunes down below and being violent. I believe the officer fired the tear gas at her directly because he thought she was filming them,” Bouzrou said.

He expressed concerns over the ongoing judicial investigation into the incident.

“The police commander on the day has refused to allow the tear gas launcher to be examined and has since been promoted. We know the names of the five police officers who had tear gas launchers but they have never been questioned by an investigating judge.”

Bouzrou said the family had decided to take legal action against Castaner because he had publicly insisted it was an accident.

“This is a political issue. It’s important for the president of the Republic and the government to say nobody died because of police actions during the Gilets Jaunes protests in France. This is wrong.

“Mr Castaner has blamed the hospital for her death. He said it was the shock of the surgery. Suddenly Mrs Redouane died not because of what the police did, but because of a medical error. This is utter nonsense.”

The interior ministry told Le Monde that Castaner had simply relayed information received from the Marseille public prosecutor.

A police spokesperson said the official report that concluded the fatal incident was accidental had been carried out by “scientific, medical, ballistic and technical experts” who had examined the “angle of fire, the position of the firer, the distance and impact of the teargas grenade. The drawing up of the report was overseen by an investigating magistrate.”

“But of course it is impossible for it [the report] to say if it was deliberate or not,” he added.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,

1011,1011,‘The holy grail of packaging recycling’: can digital watermarking put an end to sorting woes?,[],"If there’s one thing the British public likes to complain about, it’s recycling. What gets recycled, what doesn’t, where it ends up and who’s paying for it. And if the sorting machines at recycling plants could talk, they would probably be moaning too.

When recycling arrives at material recovery facilities (MRFs), the first step is to sort items into different material streams. But this isn’t always straightforward. “Sometimes it’s really hard to identify what kind of material it is,” says Thorsten Leopold, director of international packaging for home care at the consumer goods company Henkel. “If the sensors cannot fully identify the material or if it’s covered by a sleeve [or label], then this can give the sorting machine some headaches,” he says.

With a target set by the EU Plastics Pact for 100% of plastic packaging to be reusable or recyclable by 2025, it’s vital that action is taken on all sides. This includes addressing packaging design and consumer behaviour and, crucially, the effectiveness of recycling technologies – essentially the lynchpin of the entire system.

‘The objective is to increase farmer incomes’: how traceability protects both the planet and workers Read more

Now, a new pan-European project with more than 85 participating companies and organisations could help ensure that what goes into a consumer’s bin actually goes on to be correctly sorted and recycled. Under the HolyGrail 2.0 project, facilitated by AIM, the European Brands Association, digital watermarking technology will be trialled on an industrial scale. “This means that on the packaging there is an embedded, invisible code that cannot be seen by the naked eye but can be seen by cameras,” says Leopold. The watermark, a bit like a QR code and about the size of a postage stamp, is printed across the bottle and contains information about the product. It could identify what the item is made of or whether it’s a food or non-food product. Once the watermark is read, the item is sent off to the correct waste stream. Importantly, the more accurate the sorting function in MRFs, the higher quality the reprocessed material at the end, which is beneficial for companies looking to buy up that recyclate.

And why the curious name? Is the technology so promising that it could be, in fact, the answer in regards to efficiently sorting recycling? Well, actually, yes. “It makes reference to the huge potential of digital watermarks to tackle today’s problems in sorting and recycling packaging,” says Eva Schneider, sustainability and communications manager at the European Brands Association. “[Digital watermarking] has the potential to become the holy grail of packaging recycling.”

Henkel is one of the project pioneers, and has already released a product, its bottle for Vernel fabric softener, which contains this technology. It has been released in Germany, and Leopold is excited about its potential. Not just in regards to more sophisticated and efficient recycling, but the other applications that the watermark could be used for. He picks up his smartphone and scans a Vernel bottle. Up pops the product’s website. He explains that the consumer could access info about the product, perhaps related to its sustainability credentials. Within the supply chain and logistics, there are potential benefits too. “Maybe in future, automatic robot systems could scan an entire aisle and directly see what [needs to be restocked],” he says.

One of the main goals of the EU Plastics Pact (and, indeed, the US and UK Plastics Pacts as well) is to create a circular economy for plastics. This means that materials are kept in use for as long as possible, and nothing is wasted. Developing technologies and improving efficiencies around recycling is an important lever in moving towards this goal. Indeed, the precursor to HolyGrail 2.0 was an initial exploration under the New Plastics Economy initiative run by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation to look into chemical tracers and digital watermarking.

Chemical tracing involves embedding a marker in the label or plastic resin that shows up fluorescent under UV light, so it can be detected by specially designed sorting machines. Although an interesting technology, it was decided that digital watermarking was the more promising of the two technologies and, thus, it became the sole focus of HolyGrail 2.0.

Leopold points out, however, that at present there are no recycling plants equipped with the cameras needed to detect the digital watermarks. “We are in a very early pioneering phase,” he says, emphasising that the bottles are being tested and sorted in a lab environment for the time being. He is hopeful that this testing phase will prove the viability of the technology, and pave the way for a larger rollout. And Schneider is cautiously optimistic. “Even with promising results for the basic proof of concept on a test sorting line (under the first iteration, HolyGrail 1.0), and successful cross-value chain engagement, it is important to keep ourselves grounded,” she says. “The results we achieve over the next year will reveal whether we can scale up digital watermarks on packaging and really get this technology to where it needs to be.”

Nevertheless, there is no doubt in Leopold’s mind that it has legs, particularly because it is multipurpose. “It brings big advantages, especially in the retail space,” he says, explaining that at the checkout the entire item could be scanned, instead of the barcode that sometimes takes a while to find. “This means that checkout times could be decreased by 30% or so, which is a very interesting benefit for retailers.”

The team behind HolyGrail 2.0 is actively looking into all these applications, but Schneider is keen to point out that the main focus is to pioneer solutions around smart packaging. “One of the most pressing challenges in achieving a circular economy for packaging is finding a way to accurately sort post-consumer waste. Digital watermarks have the potential to revolutionise this process,” she says. “The HolyGrail 2.0 initiative combines the three key ingredients needed for a circular economy: innovation, sustainability and digitalisation. Initial proof-of-concept demonstrations have already shown what digital watermarks can achieve on a test sorting line. Now, it’s time to take this testing to the next level.”",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
740,740,'It's impossible': how Brexit has left British families unable to return to the UK,[],"When Britain’s new immigration bill became law earlier this month, the home secretary, Priti Patel, tweeted her “delight, after many years of campaigning,” that free movement between the EU and Britain would at last end on 31 December.

But the bill does not just repeal EU citizens’ right to work and live in UK – a key Brexit ask – or British nationals’ right to do the same across the bloc. It will also make it very hard indeed for many Britons who have already moved to ever come home again.

As Brexit negotiations on a trade and security deal enter what foreign secretary Dominic Raab said could be their final week, many Britons and Europeans are facing major life changes regardless of what happens now.

“It will place a lot of people before an impossible choice,” said Jessica Frizell, 46, who has lived and worked in Italy since 1997. “I built my life on my EU rights. The fact I may not now be able to go back with my family is … a shock.”

Frizell, who works for a school textbook publisher, is a model for almost half a century of British EU integration. Her husband, Alberto, 44, is Italian, a sales manager for a textile company in Tuscany; the couple have a girl and a boy aged nine and 13.

Frizell’s mother, in her 70s, lives in Cumbria; her brother is in Poland, with a Polish wife and – like his sister – two dual-nationality children. “We’re very settled; we have careers and families,” said Jessica. “We’re not thinking of going home yet.”

But that may change. “My big worry is my mother,” Frizell said. “She’s fit and well, but if she needed looking after … Or if the kids go to university in the UK, settle, have families: we might want to move. Well, we could now – but not for much longer.”

At present, said Fiona Godfrey of British in Europe, whose tireless but ultimately futile lobbying helped secure a first defeat of the bill in the House of Lords, Britons in the bloc can move back to the UK with EU family members, “almost without restriction”.

That right, however, will end on 29 March 2022. “After that,” Godfrey said, “if you want to come back with your non-British partner, you’ll need to earn £18,600 a year, a lot more if you have non-British kids. And if your partner wants to move and be able to work in their own right immediately, they’ll have to meet the new points system.”

Godfrey said up to 40% of Britons likely to want to return feared they would not fulfil the income requirement, and most of their partners did not do jobs on the Home Office list. Associated costs – NHS surcharges, fees – could run into thousands of pounds.

“It’s just a massive change,” said Godfrey. “It basically asks people to decide now, in the next 15 months, whether they want to change their whole lives. For many, it’s asking them to choose between elderly parents in Britain and partners and children in the EU.

“It’s a terrible choice, and it’s really not one that any civilised government should be asking its citizens to make.”

Making matters worse is the fact that the act - whose full name is the Immigration and Social Security Co-ordination (EU Withdrawal) Act 2020 - actively discriminates against British citizens abroad compared to EU citizens living in the UK.

Under the settled status scheme, family members of EU nationals may join them in the UK from the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December. “The government seems to have singled out its own citizens for harsher treatment,” Godfrey said.

“It’s extraordinary, really: why would you hurt your own people for exercising rights that you granted them? Punishing them for taking the opportunity to live abroad and marry foreigners. So much for Global Britain.”

According to a recent British in Europe member survey, more than 30% are under 44, have jobs, partners with jobs, and children in school in their host state - so might find it hard to move fast. Of the rest, those over 55 could have trouble finding a job in the UK.

While barely 10% are currently considering returning to the UK, the group says, 79% would like at least the option of being able to do so later. “The government said we wanted special treatment, to bypass the law,” Godfrey said.

“We just wanted to keep the rights we had. And we’re not talking about a never-ending stream of people – it’s a finite number, those in the EU on 31 December 2020, most of whom would be unlikely to come back anyway. It’s just nonsense.”

Some are more forthright. Arthur Wood, 60, lives in Geneva with his Norwegian wife, an EEA citizen who works for the United Nations. “Boris Johnson and many others promised that expats would not be affected by Brexit,” he said.

“We’ve been married for 25 years, have three dual-nationality children, pay UK tax on our London home – and if we don’t move back by March 2022, face a means test to be able to come to Britain with our families. My wife faces a choice between her career and her UK rights. It’s hard to see any moral or pragmatic argument for it.”

Emma Woodford, 49, has been in Belgium since 2009, Married to a Dutchman, with two daughters aged 13 and 15 born in Bangkok, she recently took Belgian citizenship – but cannot transfer her British nationality to her daughters because she, too, was born abroad.

“If we wanted to move back we’d have to go through so many hoops now,” Woodford said, “and we’re not sure we’d meet the minimum income. It’s seems unfathomable to me … Horrendously unfair, and such a waste of time and money.”

Sue Tremenheere, 57, who has lived and worked in Rome since 1986, said she and her Italian husband “could not possibly decide by March 2022” whether they might want to settle in the UK. It was possible, she said: one daughter was already at university in the UK, the other may follow suit.

“But how can we know now? What makes me most angry: my sister has been in Australia for years – she knew when she left she might have to go through the hoops to come back with a family. But this was a right I had that’s been taken away.”

In Thessaloniki, Fay Castling, 50, who first came to Greece as a Thomson Holidays rep in 1992 and never quite managed to leave, also has a son studying in Britain. She had always planned to accompany her daughter, who has a lung condition and needs special care, should she decide to follow.

“Brexit means I can’t do that now, because I don’t yet have a full residence permit, so I can’t leave Greece for more than three months,” she said. “Then we thought: perhaps my husband, Kyriakos, could take a year off and go instead of me. Now that’s not possible either, because of the Immigration Act.”

The couple would be “very unlikely” to reach the minimum income requirement were they ever to decide to move to the UK together, Castling said. “It just seems so sad,” she said. “So many people’s choices taken away – all those things my generation could do … And now it really seems like I may never be able to go back.”

Some in the UK are worried, too. Barbara De Vita, 69, and her Italian husband Piero, 76, returned to the UK in 1996 after 25 years in Italy. They have two sons, Christian, born in Italy but currently living in England, and Daniel, born in Britain but currently living in Sweden with his Franco-Swedish partner and their child.

“Daniel may want to come back – not yet, certainly, but at some stage,” Barbara said. “And what’s so absurd is that at the moment, our son who was born in Italy has more right to be in the UK than one born in Britain. Our MP, Matt Hancock, said this was about fair and equal treatment for all. It doesn’t look very fair or equal to me.”

868,868,New Zealand declares a climate change emergency,[],"Jacinda Ardern calls climate change ‘one of the greatest challenges of our time’ and pledges carbon-neutral government by 2025

New Zealand has declared a climate change emergency and committed to a carbon-neutral government by 2025, in what the prime minister Jacinda Ardern called “one of the greatest challenges of our time”.

A motion tabled in parliament on Wednesday recognised “the devastating impact that volatile and extreme weather will have on New Zealand and the wellbeing of New Zealanders, on our primary industries, water availability, and public health through flooding, sea level rise, and wildfire”.

Thirty-two other nations have formally acknowledged the global crisis by declaring a climate emergency.

The motion acknowledged the “alarming trend in species decline and global biodiversity” including the decline in New Zealand’s indigenous biodiversity.

The declaration of a climate emergency was supported by the Green Party and Māori Party and opposed by the National and Act parties.

Speaking in parliament after its introduction, Ardern said the country must “act with urgency”.

Climate emergency: New Zealand must match words and actions Read more

“This declaration is an acknowledgement of the next generation. An acknowledgement of the burden that they will carry if we do not get this right and do not take action now,” she said.

“It is up to us to make sure we demonstrate a plan for action, and a reason for hope.”

Ardern said the government sector will be required to buy only electric or hybrid vehicles, the fleet will be reduced over time by 20% and all 200 coal-fired boilers used in the public service’s buildings will be phased out.

The motion also calls for recognition of the “significant progress on meeting the challenge” by the country through signing the Paris Agreement and passing the Zero Carbon Act 2019, which commits New Zealand to reducing emissions.

That legislation – which sets up a Climate Change Commission tasked with putting the country on a path to net zero emissions by 2050 – made New Zealand one of few countries to have a zero-emissions goal enshrined in law.

But experts says the country is well behind on changes needed. The lack of action was “embarrassing” and had become “untenable”, University of Canterbury political science professor Bronwyn Hayward said last week. “The irony is, even under [President] Trump, the US is going to have made better per-capita reductions than we have.”

Writing in The Conversation, Robert McLachlan, a professor of applied mathematics at Massey University, said New Zealand was yet to make emissions reductions. Of 43 industrialised countries, New Zealand is among 12 that have seen net emissions increase between 1990 and 2018.

This is despite strong statements from the prime minister, such as this when the Zero Carbon Act was passed in November last year: “[New Zealand is] on the right side of history. I absolutely believe and continue to stand by the statement that climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.”

Wednesday’s declaration also said the government will “demonstrate what is possible to other sectors of the economy by reducing the government’s own emissions and becoming a carbon-neutral government by 2025”.

But opposition parties have described the move as a publicity stunt, with the National Party leader, Judith Collins, calling it “virtue signalling”.

“We think it’s all very well to declare an emergency but there’s no proper plan in place as to how to deal with it,” Collins told Radio New Zealand.

As an example, she pointed to the government’s fleet of more than 15,000 vehicles, of which only about 10% are electric.

New Zealand contributes just 0.17% of global emissions but that is high for its size, placing it 17th out of 32 OECD countries. Its net emissions have risen by 60% in the past two decades.

The nation’s biggest source of CO2 emissions is road transport but most greenhouse gases stem from agriculture.

New Zealand’s pledges have been seen internationally as less than required and the second-term Labour government is yet to introduce carbon-cutting policies that would put the country on track to meet its emission targets.",TheGuardian,1,,,,,,,,,,,,
